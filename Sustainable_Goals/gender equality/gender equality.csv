ContextPlantwise is a global programme led by CABI that aims to help farmers reduce crop losses and increase productivity, through strengthening plant health systems, therefore improving the agricultural resilience of rural farmers.Plant clinics are a central part of the programme, where trained extension staff deliver on-demand advice to farmers at central locations e.g. market places, community centres, at regular days and times.In 2013, the Government of Nepal (GoN) and CABI entered into an agreement for the adoption and implementation of the Plantwise programme in the country.It was agreed that the Plant Quarantine and Pesticide Management Centre (PQPMC), erstwhile the Plant Protection Directorate, would be the contact point and coordinating agency in Nepal.The programme trained more than three hundred extension staff (including about 20% women staff) from different district agriculture offices on different modules of the Plantwise programme.These trained extension staff successfully set up and ran plant clinics in their respective areas.Due to the success and relevance of the programme, the GoN institutionalized different Plantwise components in its internal programme with an annual allocation of more than GBP 50,000.However, due to a shortage of staff, (the farmer to extension agent ratio is 1270:1 (Dhital, 2017)), it was decided that plant clinics need to be extended to other alternative approaches like Farmer Field Schools, an FAO initiative; and the CBF programme adopted by iDE, to reach more farmers.In 2018, it was agreed between PQPMC, CABI and iDE that the Plantwise programme should work in collaboration with the ongoing CBF initiative in the country.The CBF initiative trains entrepreneurial farmers based in rural communities with basic IPM skills, to provide extension advice to farmers on agricultural inputs.The CBFs earn a commission from agro-dealers on input sales.Adopting a novel approach, CABI and IDE trained CBFs as plant doctors with courses covering plant health diagnosis, treatment advice and record management.",,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

It is an important crop for Nepal's upland farmers because it is a climate-smart crop that withstands environmental adversities and can be cultivated in rain-fed marginal lands with minimum or low external inputs (Joshi et al. 2002; Adhikari 2012). It is a rich and inexpensive source of dietary fibre, iron, calcium, and zinc (NARC 2005; Dida and Devos 2006; Mal et al. 2010). The role of finger millet as a cheap source of valuable nutrients becomes more prominent in a country like Nepal, where 25 percent of the population makes less than US$1.25 per day and where the indicators of human development and food security – such as life expectancy (69 years), child mortality (50 children U5/1,000 live births), underweight child (38.6 percent), maternal mortality (170 women/ 100,000 live births), and adult literacy (60 percent) – are dismal at regional as well as global levels. However, farmers are progressively losing interest in finger millet cultivation because of its tedious and labour-intensive agronomic practices and post-harvest operations. Moreover, it is neglected in the national research and extension system and generally perceived as a low-status food crop in Nepal.",,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

Critical to such studies, and increasingly considered essential to HIV prevention efforts, is the gender constructs and power dynamics within relationships. However, little efforts have been made, which focus on male clients of FSWs, particularly on the relationship between gender ideologies and men's sexual contact with FSWs, within the Nepali context. The present study aims to fill this critical gap by assessing the prevalence of use of FSWs and its association with STIs/HIV-related risk behaviors and gender ideologies among Nepali men. We used data from the nationally representative Nepal Demographic Health Survey (NDHS) 2011. For the purpose of analyses, we included a sample of 4,121 men, aged 15-49 years. During data analyses, we used multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for the following variables: age, region, residence, religion, educational level, wealth index, employment status, and cigarette smoking status. Of the total sample, approximately 5% reported the use of FSWs in their lifetime. In regression models, men who had sex with FSWs were more likely to report a history of STIs [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.03; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.69-5.43; P < 0.001], not using condom all the time (aOR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.05-2.12; P = 0.010), more than one sexual partner (aOR: 3.75; 95% CI: 2.18-5.23; P < 0.001), and have had early sexual debut (aOR: 2.60; 95% CI: 1.85-3.67; P < 0.001).

Eighty households were chosen by random sampling and a scheduled interview was carried out. Most of the activities such as fence construction, transplanting, fertilizer use, harvesting, cleaning, and grading were found typically female's responsibility. However, males were found dominantly involved in land preparation. Also, males were found to have relatively more access to, and control over farm resources and played dominant role in decision making than women.

Nepal has put in place provisions to include women and members of other marginalized communities in parliament and other state leadership positions. Women's participation in politics remains a challenge globally as women continue to remain invisible in decision-making bodies. Representation of women in parliament should not be merely limited to descriptive participation; instead, it should be more focused on substantive representation. The societal belief that men should be the ones in powerful political position also discourages women to participate in politics and work for gender equality. Women's lack of engagement in politics is mostly due to a lack of political education along with constraints put on women to labor solely within the home.

This study aims to review the relationship between food safety and food security, sustainable food systems, awareness, and food policies in Nepal, while also discussing the potential roles of women in these areas. Furthermore, the empirical examination presents our findings based on primary survey data from 604 consumer households in five major metropolitan areas of Nepal, Particularly focusing on gender differences in food safety awareness and purchase of fresh produce. Our overall findings suggest that the basic food safety practices and the enforcement of regulations have been overlooked in Nepal. Moreover, the study also underscores the potential roles women could play in enhancing awareness of safer fresh produce systems and safer food consumption. However, the findings also indicate that women in Nepal have lower awareness of food safety compared to men, emphasizing the need to improve education and awareness among women.

This paper examines the reconstruction of households structure and the changing roles, with a focus on gendered power relation in the slum community of Pokhara Metropolitan City, Nepal. Particular, attention is paid to the transformation of breadwinner power of men to women and increasing women participation in decision making process.

Both quantitative and qualitative methods were chosen for the data collection and analysis. The results explain changing scenario of gender role and households transition due to access of social, cultural and economic capital accumulated by migrants. Once women depart for labor migration, the family left behind especially mother and husband are more responsible to carry both inside as well as outside activities along with childcare. In joint family, mother/mother-in-laws were replacing the role of migrant and doing migrants tasks; whereas in nuclear family husbands is more responsible for all conducts performed by their wives and acts as like that.

Although there has been an increase in female enrollment in medical programs, pervasive biases, gendered expectations, and informal cultural scripts—often referred to as the “hidden curriculum”—continue to influence their aspirations, specialty choices, and professional journeys. Understanding these dynamics is vital for ensuring women’s full engagement in the medical workforce. Methods: This qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews with fifteen final-year female undergraduate medical students at a private medical college in Bharatpur, Nepal. Thematic analysis was employed to identify and interpret the key themes. Results: Five key themes emerged: (1) The Marriage Mandate: Negotiating Family, Tradition, and Professional Aspirations; (2) The Gendered Clinic: Unveiling Bias in Medical Education and Practice; (3) Investing in Daughters, Expecting Returns: The Gendered Economics of Medical Education; (4) Transnational Aspirations: Negotiating Mobility, Marriage, and Medical Careers and (5) Claiming Space: Agency, Resistance, and Redefining Success in the Medical Profession. Discussion: The pervasive “hidden curriculum” of gendered barriers persists despite policy efforts, constitutional safeguards, and increasing female representation in medical schools. These challenges, if unaddressed, risk perpetuating a cycle of underutilizing women’s talents, limiting the diversity of the healthcare workforce, and hindering progress toward achieving equitable health outcomes. The findings underscore the urgent need for gender-transformative approaches that acknowledge and actively dismantle these deeply rooted biases at institutional, community, and policy levels. These approaches should focus on creating supportive structures that empower women to fully contribute to the medical profession. Conclusion: Female medical graduates encounter significant obstacles, including entrenched patriarchal norms, systemic inequalities, and a pervasive “hidden curriculum” of biases. However, they demonstrate remarkable resilience and determination in challenging stereotypes, redefining success, and reimaging their professional identities. Their experiences align with global efforts toward gender parity in education and employment. Equitable representation of women in the medical workforce is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic necessity for advancing public health, strengthening healthcare systems, and promoting social justice.

It is today recognized as a major issue on the international human rights agenda and has been defined as violence that is directed against a person on the basis of gender and sex. Globally, the refugees experience the full spectrum of gender -based violence throughout their refugee life. Hundreds and thousands of Southern Bhutanese of Nepali origin or the Lhotshampas were forced to flee Bhutan at the beginning of the 1990s, as a result of the ethnic cleansing campaign of the monarchical government of Bhutan. Over 108, 000 refugees had initially settled in the seven refugee camps spread over the districts of Jhapa and Morang in the southeastern part of Nepal. Women were a part of the refugee population who sought protection in Nepal and so refugee women who are living in the makeshift camps in Nepal for more than three decades confront not only the hardship of refugee life in the camps but also face the injustice of gender based violence, as they have reported rape, sexual assault, polygamy, trafficking and domestic violence. Hence, the paper looks into the causes, types and impacts of gender based violence in the Sanischare Bhutanese refugee camps of Nepal.",,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

The Government of Nepal endorsed GRB in 2007/2008 and made it mandatory. Accordingly, local governments have sought to undertake gender-responsive planning. However, studies show they lack a robust assessment of gender-based needs and have faced challenges in adopting GRB. To address this issue, we adopted a co-production approach where researchers and Malarani Rural Municipality in the Arghakhanchi district of western Nepal, jointly assessed the municipal plan and worked collectively to understand and revisit the gender responsive activities and plans. In this article, we provide details of this co-production process. Drawing on our engagement and the subsequent uptake of GRB in this rural municipality, we emphasise the importance of enhancing local capacity to self-assess their development policies and plans through a gender lens and ensure GRB for gender-balanced local planning processes. We conclude that although GRB is not a panacea to gender inequalities, it can ease access to resources for addressing gender disparities and promoting women’s empowerment through inclusive planning processes, especially at the municipality level. ",https://newangle.sias-southasia.org/index.php/new/article/download/105/80,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

The study is based on addressing the maternal health problems with gender perspectives, and the factors associated with health seeking practices. The main objectives of the study are to find out maternal health problem and gender analysis on decision making (household matters and health care) and the knowledge on danger signs in mother and newborn. Methods:The study is descriptive and cross sectional in design. Household surveys were conducted by the study team in 24 sample VDCs of Baglung, Dolakha and Ramechhap. Results: A total of 959 women were interviewed and 112 (11.40 percent) of them reported having faced emergency obstetric problems and about 5.6 percent of the respondents were found to be suffering from Uterus prolapse problems. The men were found getting more (81.2 percent) opportunities for education than women (58 percent). Women were found to be limited more to household activities that have low economic/monetary value (Women vs. Men: 41.83 percent Vs 4.49 percent) in comparison to men. The women’s status was found to be lower than that of men in all the indicators. The types of occupation were also clearly distinct between men and women in the study districts. Women had better knowledge (50 percent Vs 25 percent) on danger sign in mother and newborn but did not get opportunity of making decision to access health care in time. They were found having to follow their husband’s or in-laws’s decision. Conclusion: Appropriate initiative should be taken for women empowerment in order to develop women autonomy for maternal health care.

In recent years, the introduction of gender responsive budgeting has become an important topic on the government agenda to meaningfully internalize gender equality in public finance. Gender responsive budgeting, as an integral part in fiscal and budgetary decision making, can make gender equality and help differentiate the impacts on men and women. This article is based on the analytical and descriptive research design based on literature review of secondary data and information used for the analysis of the information.

Information and communication technologies such as smartphones and social media are a large part of daily life for adolescents in Nepal. Being online and using social media is not a gender neutral experience and various forms of gendered abuse have the capacity to inflict real harm. However, most scholarship on adolescent experiences online is concentrated in the global North, leaving many unanswered questions about parallel and divergent experiences in the global South. Here, we attempt to address this gap in the literature through an exploration of the important perspectives of young women in Nepal. We engage with Foucault’s concept of disciplinary power as a useful lens for thinking through girls’ experiences of being online and navigating digital GBV.

Climate variability is one of the major causes of food insecurity, poverty, and inequality in the country. Marginalized and vulnerable communities, particularly women, suffer the most severe consequences of climate change. In this paper, we qualitatively analyze primary and secondary data to understand how gender considerations are integrated into agriculture and climate change policies. It aims to identify gaps in integrating gender considerations into policies and practices. Climate change’s challenges on agriculture and food security have been identified in most agricultural policies; however, those policies remain quiet on the gender-specific impacts of climate change. Representation mandates are not sufficiently linked with officials’ overall performance, resulting in limited representation of women in budget formulation, project and program design, planning, and resource and opportunity allocation. As a way forward, our analysis suggests addressing the gaps at the policy and institutional levels. For instance, to effectively address climate change, policies should be developed with a gender-inclusive approach, along with budgetary allocations that consider the gender-specific impact of climate change. Promoting gender equality in climate-resilient agriculture in Nepal requires measures such as empowering women’s networks, establishing linkages with extension services that focus on women-led cooperatives, and investing in affordable and climate-smart tools and machinery that are women-friendly. The study offers important insights for policymakers to create gender-inclusive policies. It highlights the opportunity to coordinate inter-agency responses among stakeholders and sustain ongoing national policy dialogues to identify actions required to meet the nationally determined contributions’ commitments.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/ad2eb1/pdf,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

Nasal index is an important parameter in forensic sciences and rhinoplasty surgery. Our aim is to compare the nasal index of both males and females and its role to identify gender differences among medical students. Methods: First and second year medical students were chosen and height, breadth and nasal index were calculated. The height and width of the nose was measured using a vernier caliper. The nasal index of both males and females were calculated and compared and based on this, the nasal shape was also determined. Results: Among 184 total participants, 114 (61.9%) were Nepalese and 70 (38.1%) were Indian. In the Nepalese cohort, mean nasal height for male students was 4.58 ± 0.37 cm which was higher than females (4.39 ± 0.34 cm). The mean nasal index was higher among males in students of both the countries. The mesorrhine was most common type of morphology found among all students. Conclusions: Nasal index of male medical students was significantly higher than females. Mesorrhine nose was the commonest type of nose in our study.

We also examine the experiences of men and women regarding the impacts of climate change on agriculture in Nepal, encompassing their respective roles, duties, and vulnerabilities. This study actively contributes to the ongoing international discourse on gender and climate change. The literature review reveals that while climate change affects both men and women, it disproportionately increases the workload for women due to their limited access to reliable weather prediction information, crop and livelihood diversification alternatives, and decision-making authority. Incorporating gender considerations into initiatives for climate change adaptation and mitigation can result in enhanced and enduring solutions. This study concludes that climate change impacts have the potential to exacerbate existing gender inequalities and recommends the adoption of gender-responsive approaches when addressing climate change challenges.",https://innovationsagriculture.com/?mno=170912,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

Notably, women often live longer than men but experience poorer health outcomes, such as higher rates of disability and chronic illnesses. These differences are complicated by factors like socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and access to healthcare, suggesting that gender disparities in health are influenced by a complex interplay of biological, social, and psychological factors. Utilizing a census method, this study collected comprehensive data from older people in Palungtar Municipality-5, Gorkha district through interviews using a structured questionnaire. This approach allowed for analysis of health conditions, lifestyle habits, and access to healthcare services. The study aims to provide a nuanced understanding of how societal norms and personal behaviors influence gender disparities in physical health, thereby informing targeted interventions to improve the health and quality of life for older men and women. The findings underscore the need for gender-sensitive health interventions.

I argue that streetlight installation increases place attachment and facilitates the forming of new relationships with the socially constructed environment. I describe how respondents discuss the impact of streetlights on the daily rhythm of domestic chores and personal activities, and on their cultural beliefs and practices. The introduction of streetlights is associated with increased divisions between genders and generations, and inter-household jealousy.

The study shows that employment status in the population depends on age, level of education, and gender. Overall, young people who got employed in the formal sector were aged less than 40, with education levels of 12 and above. Gender inequalities are still evident, in particular, man-dominance in the employment of the better-off and more secure sectors because of social injustices that have always confined women to low-paying roles. It was also ascertained that age by education has a synergistic effect on employment with the workers that are young with advanced education enjoying better employment prospects. The results call for strong policy intervention concerning the enhancement of educational participation and attainment, formal gender equality, and affirmative action for the employment of younger persons. Attention should be paid to eradicating gender discrimination as well as improving the rights of both males and females in the education sector together with providing suitable conditions for older employees.

It compares women with their male counterparts across several areas, including household duties, economic conditions, education, health, political engagement, and community decision-making. The main aim has been to perform a contemporary situational analysis of women’s empowerment and rural development, utilizing both primary and secondary data. The focus is on gender inequality, socio-economic factors, political involvement, and demographic trends. The main findings have highlighted that those women, in their journey towards empowerment, require substantial support from their families, communities, and the nation. They have faced significant barriers to accessing opportunities for income generation, employment, decision-making roles, property ownership, and participation in political processes. The majority of women have been primarily engaged in household duties, contributing to their lower socio-economic status. This research seeks to improve the status of women in the study area by highlighting the importance of government policies and programs that include women in development efforts. Addressing these challenges through empowerment has become crucial not only for improving women's lives but also for fostering economic development within the community and the country at large.

It argues that all these approaches in distinct ways emphasize a modality of agency as resistance. To offer a more encompassing account of post-conflict agency the article engages Saba Mahmood’s (2012) critique of the modality of agency in feminist theory and her decoupling of agency from resistance. The article explores experiences of women who fought in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Nepal. It focuses on ‘withdrawing from politics’, a dynamic whereby women ex-fighters move away from party activities and the public sphere, and rearticulates this withdrawing as a location of political agency. The article argues that being an ‘ex-PLA’ emerges as a form of subjectivity that is crafted through experiencing war and encountering peacebuilding, enabling a production of heterogeneous modalities of agency in the post-conflict context.

However, the scenario of formation trend and their future formation potential is unknown. This paper presents 40 years of community forests (CF) formation trend in Nepal and discusses its potential formation scenario. The researchers have used updated data (mid-July, 2020) for trend analysis using Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope coefficient test. The policy provision of women participation and their actual involvement in the executive committee (EC) of community forests users' group (CFUG) has also been compared. The analysis showed 22,519 CF with an area of 2,312,545 hectares of national forests being managed by 3,088,259 households (HH). This constitutes 15.67% of the total land area, 34.98% of total forested area, 56.90% of total HH, and 62.68% of the total population of Nepal being involved in CF. Though the formation trend of CF and their respective area, HH involvement, EC members, and participation of women in EC was in increasing trend in the late 1990s to early 2000s, these variables are now decreasing. Although not statistically significant (p>0.05), the overall annual growth shows a negative trend, indicating the CF formation near the saturation point. Result reveals efforts and time to be invested in the management of CF rather than investing in a new formation. Moreover, results evident that CF ensures and obtains more than 50% women involvement both in policy and practice in the decision-making process for participatory common resource management in Nepal. Results would be a reference to policy guidance related to sustainable CF management and gender-inclusive participatory common resource management. This, again, would be a good example of a gender-inclusive natural resource management model to the other sectors in Nepal and to the global community.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2666719321000455,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

Feminist scholarship has highlighted how left-wing populism, when appealing to a generalized “people”, tend to produce homogenizing discourses that erase inequalities and difference, even when such movements integrate a gender dimension. Examining the trajectory of the Maoist movement over time, we argue that this ‘sameness’ may become contested and utilized by women participating in the lower echelons of the movement, as the political reality shifts from conflict to post-conflict context. As our main contribution, we develop a bi-directional approach that employs the concept of collective identity and allows us to examine the construction of populist agendas as a two-way interaction between the leadership of a movement and its grass roots supporters. Through this approach we show how the gender dimension was not merely a bi-product but central to both the construction of the Maoist movement’s war time ‘progressive’ identity, and the fragmentation of this identity and the movement’s populist appeal in the post-conflict context.",,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

To do so, we documented the timing, geographic patterning, and extent of gendered patterns in mortality and feeding practices for children under-five. Methods: We applied pooled multilevel regression models and survival analysis to five rounds of data from Nepal’s nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (1996–2016). We controlled for potential sociodemographic confounders, including child, maternal, household, and regional correlates, and disaggregated findings by birth order and sibling gender. Results: We found evidence of regional variation in mortality, with girls in wealthy urban areas faring the worst in terms of mortality rates. Girls’ comparative mortality advantage compared to boys in the neonatal period masks their mortality disadvantage in later periods. Mortality has fallen at a faster rate for boys than girls in most cases, leading to widening of gender inequalities. We also found evidence of female disadvantage in breastfeeding duration, which was linked to higher mortality risks, but no gender disparities in the consumption of other food items. Sibling gender and birth order also mattered for breastfeeding duration: Young girls with older sisters but with no brothers were most disadvantaged. Conclusion: While we did not find evidence of postnatal discrimination in access to solid and semi-solid foods, girls in Nepal face a disadvantage in breastfeeding duration. Girls with older sisters but no older brothers facing the greatest disadvantage, with risks being particularly concentrated for girls aged 1–4 years. This disadvantage is linked to an increased risk of mortality. To address this, community-based health programs could be expanded to continue targeted healthcare for children beyond 12 months of age, with particular focus on nutrition monitoring and health service provision for girls.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40795-022-00543-6.pdf,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

This study, thus, examined the associations between internet use and overweight/obesity in Nepal, and the extent to which these associations vary by gender and urbanity. Methods: We extracted data available from the nationally representative Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2016. Body Mass Index (BMI) was the outcome of interest. The use of internet (IU) in the last twelve months and frequency of using internet (IUF) in the last month were the primary exposure of interest. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression models at different levels were fitted to obtain the adjusted effects of exposures. Results: Of 10,380 study participants, 38.5% were males, and 61.5% were females. About 33% of the respondents were overweight and obese (SA cut-off). The prevalence of IU was 31.3% among adults in Nepal.

Materials and methods: The study analyzed the nationally representative Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2016 data, collected between June 2016 and January 2017. The outcome was overweight/obesity. Exposures were internet use (IU) in the last twelve months and internet use frequency (FIU) in the last month. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the total effects of IU and FIU on overweight/obesity adjusted for minimal sufficient adjustment set of potential confounders. P-difference was extracted using a Wald test for the models with interaction terms. Results: Of the 10,380 participants, 33.9% used internet in the last 12 months, and 13.1 % used less than/at least once in a week, and 17.5% used internet almost every day. The prevalence of overweight/obesity by IU was 38% (95% CI: 35.9%, 40.1%) for male and 44.1% (95% CI: 41.6%, 46.6) for female. The risk of overweight and obesity was significantly 1.55 times higher (aOR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.40, 1.73; p < 0.001) among those participants who used the internet compared to the individual who did not use the internet in the last 12 months or earlier of the interview. Similar associations were observed when using the augmented measure of exposure-FIU. We observed modification effect of gender in the associations of IU (p-difference<0.001) and FIU (p-difference<0.002) with overweight and obesity in Nepal.

I argue that the feminised labour migration from Nepal is largely the result of the ways in which various local and global forces have merged to create conducive conditions for women’s migration in the first place. Additionally, feminised labour migration in Nepal has some distinct characteristics. Women’s migration from Nepal is predominantly in the domestic sector and remains concentrated in the Arabian Gulf countries. Most of the women who work as migrant workers come from the already marginalised dalit and janajati communities. There is the predominant use of unofficial channels of migration. Unlike the feminisation of migration that invokes the notion of ‘hypermobility’ of women across national borders, women’s migration in Nepal paradoxically reveals the importance of immobilities created at different sites and at different levels.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-981-97-9715-8_9,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

We firstly argue that the experiences of women construction workers in Nepal are shaped by compulsive engagement in labor markets under conditions of informality, precarity, and gendered responsibility for social reproduction. These experiences reflect multiple intersections of gender, class, caste, and ethnicity in the arenas of the household, the workplace, trade unions, and the state. However, policy interventions related to women's participation in labor markets and inspired by the Gender Equality as Smart Economics approach, such as Nepal's post‐earthquake mason training scheme targeting women construction workers, render invisible these structures of inequality, exploitation, and violence. Second, we argue that women construction workers negotiate—and in some cases challenge and change—working conditions, primarily through a variety of informal and formal collective strategies. Women construction workers' own narratives and practices, we find, bear little resemblance to the narratives promoted by the International Financial Institutions and the state, in which women workers appear as resilient, altruistic, and industrious entrepreneurial subjects seeking individual self‐improvement within the neoliberal framework. They rather invoke informal and organized collectivities, negotiate, and often resist, gendered norms of behavior and at times radically re‐envision the scope of trade union struggles.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gwao.13078,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

The CARE Tipping Point Initiative in Nepal engaged men and boys as structured allies in girl-centered movement building to prevent VAWG, including sexual bullying and gender harassment (SBGH). We assessed whether this initiative in Kapilvastu and Rupandehi districts in Western Nepal affected adolescent boys’ reports of ever witnessing SBGH of a girl by another boy. Eligible boys were unmarried, 12–16 years, and not intending to migrate over the next 24 months. 1,154 (93% of) eligible, consenting boys across 54 randomly selected clusters participated at baseline, and 1,143 (99.0% of) baseline participants were followed. Outcomes were ever witnessed acts of non-contact (0–7; 0/1) and contact (0–7; 0/1) SBGH of a girl by another boy or male peer. Difference-in-difference (DID) regressions were estimated to assess the unadjusted and adjusted average treatment effects on these outcomes for participants assigned to the Tipping Point Program (TPP), Tipping Point Plus Program (TPP+), or control. Reports of ever witnessing acts of non-contact SBGH increased from 64% at baseline to 77% at follow-up due to increased reporting of ever witnessing “writing sexual messages…about a girl.” In adjusted models, boys in the TPP+ group ever witnessed 0.42 fewer acts of non-contact SBGH than did boys in the control group. Reports of ever witnessing acts of contact SBGH implausibly declined from 42% at baseline to 38% at follow-up, and this trend did not differ across study arm in adjusted models. Thus, compared to the control group, the TPP+ group may have reported smaller increases in ever witnessing acts of non-contact SBGH and more often concealed previously reported acts of non-contact SBGH ever witnessed. Future intervention studies should assess bystander motivation, self-efficacy, and behavior as direct measures of boys’ allyship to prevent SBGH and VAWG.",,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

Until recently, population-based data describing the experiences of transgender students and students questioning whether they are transgender (questioning) have been limited. In 2023, the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey assessed transgender identity, providing the first nationally representative data about transgender students. This report describes the demographic characteristics of transgender and questioning high school students and examines differences in the prevalence of experiences of violence, poor mental health, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, school connectedness, and unstable housing among transgender, questioning, and cisgender high school students nationwide. In 2023, 3.3% of U.S. high school students identified as transgender, and 2.2% identified as questioning. Transgender and questioning students experienced a higher prevalence of violence, poor mental health, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and unstable housing, and a lower prevalence of school connectedness than their cisgender peers. Compared with 8.5% of cisgender male students, 25.3% of transgender students and 26.4% of questioning students skipped school because they felt unsafe. An estimated 40% of transgender and questioning students were bullied at school, and 69% of questioning students and 72% of transgender students experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, a marker for experiencing depressive symptoms. Approximately 26% of transgender and questioning students attempted suicide in the past year compared with 5% of cisgender male and 11% of cisgender female students. Intervention opportunities for schools to create safer and more supportive environments for transgender and questioning students can help address these disparities.

This chapter examines whether women and men manage household waste differently at the household level, especially at source segregation, managing recyclable waste (paper and plastic), and composting degradable waste. Using household survey data from the Bharatpur Metropolitan City of Nepal, we find that women are more likely to segregate waste at the source and also manage degradable waste at home better. Still, there is no gender difference in selling plastic and paper waste. In contrast, women are more likely to give paper or plastic waste either to the waste collectors (free) or throw away, suggesting a heterogeneity across gender when it comes to managing household waste. In most cases, women waste managers perform well (segregating at source and composting degradable waste), but they do not seem to do well in all areas of plastic or paper waste management where some sort of sensitization may be helpful.",,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

It intensifies the socially created inequalities between men and women where women are always the worst victim for their gender differentiated roles and lack of access and control over resources. This paper discusses gender perspective on climate induced disaster, its impact and adaptation in Dodhara and Chandani VDCs of the Kanchanpur district based on the both primary and secondary sources of data. The primary information was collected using structured questionnaire from 96 households, key informant interviews and focus group discussion in both VDCs. The meteorological data (30 years) particularly rainfall and temperature were analysed to see the rainfall pattern and temperature trends. Analysis of temperature data revealed increment of mean annual temperature by 0.02° C per year, which verified the increase in number of warmer days in the study area. The analysis of rainfall data confirmed that the rainfall trend was declining by 1.66 mm per year in monsoon. The average monsoon rainfall recorded in the Mahendranagar Station was 413.4 mm (1984- 2013). However, people recently experience heavy rainfall in monsoon. Women were found dependent on men during disaster period.

The volume examines the rich diversity of constitutional responses to sex, gender and sexuality in the region from a comparative perspective. Leading comparative constitutional law scholars identify ‘opportunity structures’ to explain the uneven advancement of gender equality through constitutional litigation and consider a combination of variables which shape the diverging trajectories of the jurisdictions in this study.
 The authors also embed the relevant constitutional and legal developments in their historical, political and social contexts. This deep contextual understanding of the relationship between sex, gender, sexuality and constitutionalism greatly enriches the analysis. The case studies reflect a variety of constitutional structures, institutional designs and contextual dynamics which may advance or impede developments with respect to sex, gender and sexuality. As a whole, the chapters further an understanding of the constitutional domain as a fruitful site for advancing gender equality and the rights of sexual and gender diverse people.
 The jurisdictions covered represent all Asian sub-regions including: East Asia (Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea), Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines and Indonesia), and South Asia (India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka).

This chapter examines how gender issues that were considered are addressed in the policies related to electricity in India, Kenya, and Nepal. The analysis reveals that whilst more than half of the reviewed documents were devoid of any explicit mention of gender concerns, an increasing number of electricity policies are now reflecting gender considerations. The predominantly “gender-blind” approach towards the potential benefits of electricity access emanates from a reluctance to explicitly acknowledge gender based differences in needs in creating equitable outcomes. The assumption that electricity access itself is enough for associated benefits to trickle down, that too equitably for men and women, stems from limited awareness. This is aggravated further by the absence of documented evidence on the merit of including gender elements in electrification policies and programmes. Based on the review of existing electricity policies, this chapter provides specific recommendations for incorporating gender in the electricity policies with a view to support and address the broader energy justice concerns.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-24021-9_6,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

This principle says that everyone, regard less of their gender, should be treated fairly and equally in all aspects of their lives. This includes equal access to high-quality education, employment opportunities, and a role in politics and social life. In addition, gender equality in education means ensuring that men, women, marginalized community and LGBTQI+ have equal opportunities to obtain high quality education without facing any barriers or discrimination. Similarly, gender equality in employment requires that men, women, marginalized community and LGBTQI+ receive equal opportunities to work, receive equal pay and progress in their careers regardless of their gender. Gender equality in politics aims to ensure that men and women have the same right to be involved and contribute to the political process and decision-making.

Respondents of age group &gt; 34 years old named and identified significantly (p &lt; 0.01) more varieties than age group &le; 34 in overall, indicating that the older generation is more knowledgeable and the knowledge hasn&rsquo;t been adequately inherited to younger generations resulting in the erosion of knowledge. Similarly, males are significantly more knowledgeable than females in overall and among the higher age group category (p &lt; 0.01), likely because males from Madhesi community have wider social networks both within and outside their villages than females. Females are more knowledgeable than males in the lower age group category because girls are engaged more in household chores and farming activities, while boys attain higher grades and travel for off-farm jobs. There was a strong correlation among the three techniques, namely, naming, recognizing standing crops, and recognizing the seeds (p &lt; 0.01). This suggests that all the techniques are robust and can be interchangeably used for such type of studies depending on time and resource availability. This study finally infers that proper knowledge transfer is necessary to reduce the gulf of the knowledge gap between males and females as well as between generations if agrobiodiversity is to be conserved and utilized for growth and development of agriculture in the long run.",http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/download/0/0/43449/45571,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

The country ranks 30th in terms of flood risk, with hilly regions prone to landslides and lowland plains frequently affected by floods. Each year, disasters such as floods, landslides, fires, heat waves, cold waves, and epidemics cause significant loss of lives and livelihood assets. Given the critical role of gender in disaster vulnerability, it is essential to analyze gender-specific perspectives on disaster risk and resilience. Objective: The study aims to explore gender roles and their associated vulnerabilities in disaster events. By examining the perceptions of males and females regarding different disaster-related variables, the research seeks to provide insights into gender-based differences in disaster preparedness, response, and resilience-building efforts. Methods: A quantitative study was conducted in Sarawal Rural Municipality of Nawalparasi West, Nepal. A total of 428 respondents were selected through random sampling, comprising 311 males and 117 females. The study employed six major disaster variables as defined by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) to analyze gender perspectives critically. Statistical methods were used to assess the association between gender and disaster perception. Findings: The study revealed a significant association between gender and disaster perceptions. Males and females demonstrated differing views on disaster risks, preparedness, and coping mechanisms. Understanding these gender-specific differences can help determine levels of vulnerability, identify associated risks, and enhance the coping capacities of different groups. Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need to incorporate gender perspectives into disaster-related research and resilience-building initiatives. Addressing gender-based vulnerabilities can lead to more effective disaster preparedness and response strategies, ultimately improving community resilience. Novelty: This study provides empirical evidence on the gendered dimensions of disaster perception in Nepal, highlighting the importance of integrating gender considerations into disaster risk management. By focusing on a rural municipality, the research offers localized insights that can inform policy and program development for gender-inclusive disaster resilience planning.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/njmr/article/download/75462/58655,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

The purpose of this study is to investigate the gender differences in child work and the consequences such differences have for the improvement of Nepal's economy. Utilizing information obtained from the Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS) conducted in 1995, this study illustrates the numerous ways in which gender influences decisions about child work and schooling. Particular attention is paid to the role that poverty, access to credit, and household characteristics have in these decisions. As a result of the findings, it appears that girls are more likely to be engaged in household work and less likely to attend school in comparison to males. This has ramifications for Nepal's economic development in the long run. In order to address these discrepancies and to promote gender equality in school and the labor market, policy solutions are presented throughout this article.",https://ejournal.yasin-alsys.org/arzusin/article/download/5107/3962,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

Women in Nepal face several inequalities and violence. The causes are diverse, but most of these results are due to socially assigned lower positioning of women. The hierarchies based on power make women face subordination and violence in Nepal. The study aims to explore participants' understanding and experience to identify the status of inequality for women and how violence emerges as one of its consequences. Furthermore, it explores the causes of sex trafficking as an example of an outcome of inequality and violence. Method: The study formulated separate male and female groups using a purposive sampling method. The study used a multistage focus group discussion, where the same groups met at different intervals. Six focus group discussions, three times each with male and female groups, were conducted in a year. Thirty-six individuals, including sixteen males and twenty females, were involved in the discussions. The study used constructivist grounded theory for the data analysis. Results: The study participants identify that a power play between men and women reinforce inequality and increases the likelihood of violence for women. The findings suggest that the subjugation of women occurs due to practices based on gender differences, constricted life opportunities, and internalization of constructed differences among women. The study identifies that interpersonal and socio-cultural violence can result due to established differences between men and women. Sex trafficking, as an example of the outcome of inequality and violence, occurs due to the disadvantageous position of women compounded by poverty and illiteracy. The study has developed a concept of power-play which is identified as a cause and consequence of women's subordination and violence. This power play is found operative at various levels with social approval for men to use violence and maintain/produce inequality. Conclusion: The theoretical concept of power play shows that there are inequitable power relations between men and women. The male-centric socio-cultural norms and practices have endowed men with privilege, power, and an opportunity to exploit women. This lowers the status of women and the power-play help to produce and sustain inequality. The power-play exposes women to violence and manifests itself as one of the worst expressions used by men.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12889-022-14389-x.pdf,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

The gap between women’s responsibilities in irrigation and their voice in local irrigation management organizations is well documented, in Nepal as well as elsewhere. Existence of this gap is often seen as an indicator of gender inequity, reflecting wider power imbalances between men and women. In Nepal, the need for bridging this gap has been realized in the last decades on grounds of efficiency, equity, and sustainability. More recently, participation of women in resource management organizations is also linked to concerns of democracy and justice. In recognition of these concerns, the government of Nepal has incorporated in its policies and laws explicit rules and measures aimed at improving the gender balance in WUAs. Nepal’s eighth five-years plan first mentioned the need to promote women’s participation in agricultural and forest cooperatives. Partly reflecting the intentions of the five-years plan, the irrigation policy of  included a provision to the effect that executive committees of WUAs should have at least  percent female members (HMG/MWR ). The Irrigation Regulation of  finally made women’s representation in executive committees of WUAs mandatory by statutory law. It stipulates the compulsory presence of at least two women members in executive committees of at most nine members. Through the example of a WUA in the Tukucha Nala irrigation system, this chapter explores the effects of these quota rules on actual participation of women in decision making. It looks at how national policies are used and how they receive meaning in the actual practices and negotiations of engineers, project staff, and water users at different levels of bureaucratic planning and project implementation.

Through extensive interviews with women in post-conflict Nepal, this book analyses the intended and unintended impacts of conflict and traces the transformations in women's understandings of themselves and their positions in public life. It raises important questions for the international community about the inevitable victimization of women during mass violence, but it also identifies positive impacts of armed conflict. The book also discusses how the Maoist insurgency had empowering effects on women. The first study to provide empirical evidence on the relationship between armed conflict and social transformation from gender's perspectives, this book is a major contribution to the field of transitional justice and peacebuilding in post-armed-conflict Nepal.

Using Bourdieu’s theory of capital, I reveal how political quotas have strengthened women’s overall capital, allowing them to improve their position in both their families and society. Quotas have created new roles for women. The power and prestige attached to these new roles have not only offered some immediate changes to these women’s lives, but also led to changing perceptions of women in politics, shifting the discourse from a view of women’s participation in politics as an exception to one of it as an entitlement.

One of the main challenges is perceived to be the lack of commitments from local governments, especially with regard to resource allocation for implementation.

This study examines the implementation of one of the most praised NAPs, the Nepal NAP 2011. The study reveals that the effectiveness of the WPS agenda relies on many actors, not just the government. The role of international donors is equally crucial. In countries like Nepal, where a large portion of the development budget comes from international donors, giving sole responsibility for the implementation of the WPS agenda to the government limits its transformative potential and raises questions around the accountability of the international community.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09718524.2020.1766187,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

The indigenous people living in mountain plays the major role in carbon management. Further, the role and responsibilities of men and women varies differently in natural resource conservation and management. However, their participation in decision-making and benefit sharing is poor. The majority of women have unequal access to productive resources and decision-making process. Therefore, study on gender based agro-pastoral activities, their contribution on carbon management and decision-making process were carried out in Tamang ethnic group of Gatlang VDC of Rasuwa district, Nepal. For the purpose, 30 households were selected purposively. Similarly, four focus group discussions were carried out among the separate group of women, men and group consisting both men and women. Carbon management types: input carbon and output carbon activities were studied on men and women. In total, 23 different agro-pastorals related activities were found, among them 57% of work were supported by women, 39% by both men and women, and 4% by men only. With respect to fuel-wood, in average, 10 kg per day fuelwood is necessary for one household. The use of biomass for cooking emits chocking smoke and causes indoor air pollution. All these disadvantages lead to carbon emission which might lead to health deterioration of women by increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory disorders. The average fuel-wood requirement was found to be 840 kg/capita/year which are found to be higher than the other physiographic regions of Nepal. This is due to use of fuel-wood as only source of energy in the study area. Out of total respondent, it was observed that 30% literate men allow their wife to make joint decision on the major household issues. Similarly, 3% literate women respondents took the major decision by their own or jointly with their husbands. On the other hand, 30% illiterate men and 37% illiterate women either didn’t allow their wife or don’t participate in major decision-making process. Further, it is revealed from the chi square test that literacy plays major role in decision making (x2 = 5.625, df =1, p=0.017). Similarly, educated women actively join together with their husband in decision making. Moreover, women have high contribution in carbon input and output activities. Therefore, the women education should be promoted to make their equal and strong participation in decision making, which ultimately contribute in carbon input and output activities, through their greater roles in livestock husbandry and fuel-wood management relative to men. Further, importance of women’s role in carbon management should be given greater prominence.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/njes/article/download/22723/19304,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

This study investigated differentials in climate change perception among Nepal's men and women, using a river basin level primary data. Data were collected from 360 household heads of three spatial clusters – Meghauli (153), Lumle (141), and Upper-Mustang (66), located at different ecological zones of the Kaligandaki Basin. Out of the total respondents, 106 were women. Perceptions on 11 weather-related elements were asked to the respondents to level the perceived change in the unipolar Likert Scale. Such information was supplemented through 75 Key Informants (KIs), 24 Focused Group Discussions (FGDs), and Historical Timeline Calendars from nine locations. Findings suggest that differences in climate change perception exist between women and men, and women in particular generally felt a higher level of change. However, the findings are not strongly supported by both statistical tests i.e. test of mean differences (the independent sample t-test) between the responses of men and women, and the test of association (chi-square) between the gender of respondents and the type of responses they have chosen. The findings indicate that both men and women perceive the change if it was easily noticeable. Therefore, a critical understanding of the association of other socio-economic and ecological factors on the construction of perception to climate change would be necessary to form a successful climate change adaptation policy. Furthermore, since the findings are based on an exploratory and cross-sectional study, further investigation with rigorous approaches is required to draw more concrete conclusions.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/DSAJ/article/download/26568/26645,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

Research used primary data collected from 360 households, 75 Key Informants and 24 Focus Groups Discussion as well as through construction of nine Historical Timeline Calendars from three clusters – Meghauli (lower basin), Lumle (middlepart) and Upper-Mustang (upper-basin). The impact perception was assessed under seven social-ecological variables in the unipolar Likert Scale. The impact perception does not significantly differ across the gender of respondents while testing the means of perception scores and probably it is due to the impacts that have been experienced at profound level. The test of independence of gender to level of impacts indicates no significant association. This research also tried to check if other social-economic variables such as age of respondents and landholding size of household as well as self-reported economic status of households were significantly associated with some of the impacts. However, the number of cells with expected counts less than 5 in chi-square test turned to be more than 20 percent so they were considered to be invalid. Nevertheless, impact perception is significantly associated with the places of residence or study clusters, which indicates that local social-ecological system matters in climate change impacts. The qualitative information however, suggests otherwise that women feel higher level of risk and impacts, and is related to their concern over the welfare of family members and livelihood resources. Since risk perception is found to be related to spatial characteristics, this research recommends for development and implementation of targeted and localized adaptation policies. None the less, those policies must also recognize the women’s concerns on climate change impacts.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JJIS/article/download/35286/27621,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

Using data from semi-structured interviews of ten employees of MFIs and other financial institutions, this study showed that staff of the Nepalese MFIs were aware of caste and gender discriminations, but they were inactive in overcoming these social and cultural barriers in their routine work. The findings indicated that the disproportionate male-female ratio among the staff was a major hindrance in the smooth operation of MFIs. Lack of female staff and the passiveness of female borrowers lead to the problem of communication between MFIs’ staff and their clients.

Despite the advances in women's rights and some progress towards gender equality, the findings of this study suggest that newspapers continue to perpetuate gender inequality in Nepali society by featuring very few women as their news sources. Even if they are featured, they are often placed in gendered roles, largely focused on a singular image of urban Nepali women from the higher caste.",,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

Many agreements have been promoted to defend gender equality, yet women face discrimination, violence, and injustice. • According to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), gender equality should encompass equality in the households, workplace, government, and politics. • According to International Labor Organization (ILO), gender equality means that women and men have equal conditions for realizing their full human rights and for contributing to, and benefiting from, economic, social, cultural, and political development. South Asia has a population of over 1.8 billion living in countries with unique trajectories of development. Its vast human potential and geostrategic location have made this region remunerative for comprehensive engagement. However, there are struggles with processes of economic growth, widening injustice, cross-border conflict, domestic clashes, the politics of cultural revivalism, and patriarchy. Despite its heterogeneity of cultures, religions, and values, South Asia's societal norms are male oriented as patriarchal structures have characterized its history. The diversity in South Asian countries is a complete [End Page 32] contrast to the certain constants visible in patriarchy. Decision-making positions have been ignorant to the power force of the society: women. These pedestals have been ruled by men for decades. Men have been controlling the government and its decisions. In most South Asian countries, women lack access to education and basic healthcare facility, and experience poverty more than their male counterparts. Living under strict gender compulsions, women do not have the resources to fight for their rights. Therefore, it is essential for us to understand that by not including women in the decision-making process, we are questioning our own ideals of democracy because any democratic body will not move forward leaving half of its population behind. The legislatures, governments, and other systems as well have been turning a blind eye toward women who constitute 50 percent of the population. Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh already have women as the head of the state. Despite their imperfections, these South Asian countries have surpassed the most developed democracies. The most obvious example is the United States of America, which is still waiting patiently for its first woman President. One might wonder, is gender inequality an issue of individual mindset only? In response, this article is categorized into three major sections: (a) the challenging issues, (b) key data supporting the challenges, and (c) the way forward to overcome these challenges. The problem of gender inequality is not merely a mindset problem but many of these problems exist and persist because of visible and invisible hurdles that are political, economic, and social in nature. The status of women is a complex and multidimensional concept. It is said that merit must be rewarded but invisible hurdles in the form of household chores in women's lives are neither accounted nor paid or recognized and are not considered when making public policies. In addition, women have to compete often with men on same terms and conditions. Gender inequality or patriarchy is both ideological where women are governed by the beliefs, customs, norms, and social values about the status and roles of women in a society, and structural where women's access to and positions within social institutions are subjugated to the power of the male heads of households that impose restrictions on their autonomy and remains a major barrier to human development. The inequality appears when the society creates the difference between men and women, empowering one group over the other and justifying gender-based differential treatment. Women and men are split on their opinion about progress toward gender equality. A section of men thinks women's progress is negatively impacting them; the other section opines the region has not gone far enough with granting women equal rights. Difference in opinion about gender equality also varies across party lines in these countries. The major obstacles that [End Page 33] are preventing women from achieving full equality can be summarized as sexual harassment: women not having the same legal rights as men, different societal expectations for men and women, not enough women...",,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

Ideologies of ‘gender equality’ in education that are promoted in development programs and discourse, and in Maoist rhetoric, have been powerful drivers behind this. In this paper I highlight the gender and generational dynamics of the changing relationship of women to education in Nepal. I argue that the move to educating women is not a simple one, nor is it necessarily a development success story. The importance placed on educating the younger generation, including women, is also very much tied to local Bahun culture, marriage values and status. Bahun villagers of Ludigaun place great importance on both education and marriage. When combined, I argue, education has in fact become dowry. While there have been transformations in education and other modernising processes, as well as in dowry practices, in this paper I show that they have come to maintain traditional hierarchies and to support the status making of the educated Bahun man.",https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Ftaja.12361,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

The concept has potential to focus policymakers and practitioners on the inequalities and injustices that lie behind lack of access to affordable, safe, and clean water. The concept of women’s empowerment also provides an opportunity to do this. However, the vast majority of water security interventions using the term are apolitically and technically framed and fail to understand complex intersectional inequalities. We suspect that many of these interventions have been implemented following a business-as-usual approach with the risk of reproducing and even exacerbating existing gendered inequalities in access to and control over water. This article explores these concerns in the context of four villages in Western Nepal, where two internationally funded programmes aimed to empower women by improving access to water for both domestic and productive uses. They hoped to transform women into rural entrepreneurs and grassroots leaders. However, differences between women – such as age, marital status, caste, remittance flow, and land ownership – led to some women benefiting more than others. Water programmes must recognise and address difference between women if the poorest and most disadvantaged women are to benefit. Gender mainstreaming in the water sector needs to update its understanding of women’s empowerment in line with current feminist understandings of it as a processual, relational, and multi-dimensional concept. This means focusing on inter-household relations within communities, as well as intra-household relations. In addition, we recommend that water security programmes rely on more nuanced and context-specific understandings of women’s empowerment that go beyond enhanced access to resources and opportunities to develop agency to include social networks, critical consciousness, and values.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13552074.2017.1335452,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

A total of 2,817 respondents were interviewed at different locations throughout Nepal. The information was collected using the mWater surveyor. Descriptive and inferential analyses were done. The respondents having received training in agriculture were significantly higher among elite, educated, and agricultural households. Access to extension facilities was significantly determined by the type of household, ethnicity, occupation, and education of respondents. Male domination in the choice of crops, land preparation, and seed selection were significantly higher in male-headed households, marginalized groups, and agricultural households. However, females were more likely to be involved in seed sowing. The male domination in male-headed households were significantly higher for applying fertilizers, weeding, irrigation, and pest control. Among elite ethnic groups, domination of males was significantly higher for fertilizer application. The role of the male in agricultural households was significantly higher in all aspects. One unit increase in the area increased the likelihood of male involvement in irrigation by 30%. The males are likely to be more involved in harvesting, sales of products, and control of income. Elite and educated respondents coupled with access to training practiced more crop rotation compared to the rest. The likelihood of practicing intercropping and mixed cropping was influenced by extension facilities and training facilities. Elite groups and farmers with extension facilities tended to practice more agroforestry.

The purpose of this research is to delve into the detailed performance between the gender and digital participation in Panchkhal Municipality, which is located in the developing tech realm of Kavre District. The research investigates the subtle relationship between gender and digital dimensions, including self-rated digital literacy, internet habits, online safety mindfulness, and the desire to improve digital prowess. This research uses a combination of methods to access data from a field survey conducted within Panchkhal Municipality. This survey includes a wide range of participants, recording their gender preferences and digital behaviors. It also used quantitative analysis, primarily the Pearson Chi-Square test, to identify significant connections between gender and the examined digital factors. This method provides empirical support for a more nuanced sociological perspective on gender's role in forming digital interactions. The findings reveal intriguing patterns: gender has no influence on self-rated digital competence levels, but it does have a significant influence on internet use patterns, online safety awareness, and the desire to improve one's skills. These differences reveal gendered sections within tech engagement, implying that genders share inclinations while also having distinct choices, susceptibilities, and aspirations. Beyond the numbers, our research emphasizes the importance of fostering all-encompassing digital literacy initiatives that take gender differences into account. Furthermore, we advocate for just technological ecosystems while acknowledging the complex dance of norms in society, gender personas, and tech behavior. This study adds to our sociological understanding of how gender presents on the digital canvas by unraveling gender- infused threads interwoven into digital interaction. These insights transcend academia, guiding us to craft actions and policies that shape a more equitable, inclusive digital future in Panchkhal Municipality, Kavre Palanchowk district and beyond.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/TUJ/article/download/66678/50666,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

The indexing enables the motivated policy actor to produce well-crafted and feasible recommendations to reform policies. When we trialled MDI-GWP on 16 of Nepal’s federal water-related policies and acts, the multi-dimensional index tracked gender policy developments over the past 30 years, identified areas where policymakers could further consider gender, and revealed differences in gender application between sectors. We included water resources management (WRM), agriculture, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sectors. In Nepal’s case, agriculture and WASH policies are on an improving trajectory for gender equity, while WRM policy has rebounded to the gender blind.

It draws on qualitative research conducted in Nepal’s mid-hill region to centralize the experiences of widows, or single women, during and after the 2015 earthquakes. Through an intersectional lens, I deconstruct the monolithic experience of widowhood in Nepal to examine the messiness of reality and the possibility of different or even contradictory experiences in a post-disaster context. Intertwining social identities and factors beyond the trifecta of gender, marital status, and caste—such as family support, age, location, education, class, migration, property ownership, citizenship, experience in the public sphere, and NGO support—create a complex constellation of intersectionality that determined single women’s post-earthquake experiences and their access to post-disaster recovery. I find that the government’s post-earthquake housing reconstruction relief, which was predicated on property ownership, added a layer of systematic discrimination for many single women. Simultaneously, the post-earthquake development context provided a space for some single women to unite in a collective identity, facilitating a shift of longstanding stigma and an emerging renegotiation of what it means to “be a widow” in Nepal.Keywords: NepalgenderdisasterwidowintersectionalitySouth Asia Correction StatementThis article has been corrected with minor changes.

This paper tries to discuss on the gender-biased sex selection (GBSS) in favor of sons. Similarly, the study is based on descriptive as well as analytical research design. The sources of information have been based on secondary data. The facts and figures have been presented into tabular form. Several districts showed significantly skewed sex ratio at birth (SRBs) at 110 or above with Kaski, Arghakhanchi and Bhaktapur, province one and Lumbini province having the highest SRBs in Nepal. Youngest age groups at the bottom under 30 years of 5year age groups of female population are low in 2021 census. The Nepali context makes pervasive use of sex-selection likely as strong son preference. Sons are seen as economic, social and religious assets and in some parts of the country while females are seen as a burden due to the expenses involved in marriage. Fertility decline means that couples feel pressure to bear a son at a low parity. The technology of sex-selective abortion is accessible to the Nepalis. Even though prenatal sex determination and abortion based on sex selection are prohibited and may incur severe penalties in Nepal under the current abortion law passed in 2002. Nepal provides abortion was legalized in 2002 and prior to that, there was no evidence of sex-selective abortion. SSA was made a punishable offence when exceptions for legal abortion were introduced by the eleventh amendment to the Nepal’s Muluki Ain in 2002.

It also argues that far from general perceptions of women as asexual, women with disabilities are capable of leading highly creative and fulfilling sexual lives. Using critical sexual theory and postcolonial studies as critical frameworks, the book investigates the narratives of authors with disabilities, exploring policy gaps and the need for supportive gender and sexual policies through the words of those affected. In particular, the book analyzes five female Nepali authors with disabilities: Radhika Dahal, Jhamak Ghimire, Sabitri Karki, Parijaat, and Mira Sahi, demonstrating the need for supportive gender policies to address the emotional and psychological needs of women with disabilities. Overall, the book argues that disciplinary discourses in practice often consider sex or sexuality as taboo, barely recognizing women in the context of marriage and family, and therefore creating gaps between policies and marginalized narratives.

Despite its unique characteristics, Nepalese society has marked visible social and gender divisions that constrain the overall growth of the nation. Low decision-making power, poor control over assets, long working hours, inadequate membership to community institutions, poor access to credit services, and lack of access to appropriate information are some key indicators. However, it was also worth mentioning that places where there is effective leadership to address the gender-based constraints, the outcomes are more promising in attaining growth, dignity, self-confidence, and respect, answering to some of the common constraints. Methods: This research relies on literature review, expert interviews, Focus Group Discussions (FGD), simulations, and Key Informant Interviews. The expert interviews were conducted in-person to get detailed information on some of the organization-based interventions. Results: The study showed that since the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, the workload pressure has increased especially for women. It also increased the exposure to some of the common risks such as gender-based violence, women & child trafficking, abuses, stress, family tension, health care issues, fear, and other challenges. However, leaderships shown by organizations, communities, and individuals have positive impact on reducing gender-based violence. Also, reduction of other constraints such as long walking to fetch water, long working hours, restricted movements, decision making for self-improvement, lack of recognition, and seeking permission to attend social events has been addressed by community level and individual leaderships. The places where such constraints of the women have been addressed, their engagement in disaster preparedness activities are more promising. Conclusion: The research study concluded that there is potential leadership among women groups, family members, and community-based organizations to ensure the reduction of gender-based constraints, and it is helping women for productive engagement.  ",,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

This study aimed to identify the gender differences in prevalence and risk factors of comorbid diabetes and hypertension (CM) among adults aged 18 years and above in an urban community in Kathmandu, Nepal. A community-based cross-sectional analytical study was carried out in Gokarneshwor Ward 1, 2 and 3 among adults aged 18 years and above from September 2020- May 2023. Diabetes (DM) was defined as persons previously diagnosed by a physician and/or on anti-diabetic medication. Hypertension (HTN) was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥90 mm Hg or those who were diagnosed by a physician and/or receiving antihypertensive medication. Comorbidity (CM) was defined as persons with diabetes and hypertension. Information regarding socio-demographic data, behavioural and biological risk factors, anthropometric assessment and morbidity were obtained from adults aged 18 years and above using a Family study proforma. Multinomial logistic regression analyses with the referent category being persons with no diabetes or hypertension (NDH) were performed for three categories HTN vs NDH, DM vs NDH and CM vs NDH. Among 1538 adults with 776 women, overall prevalence of comorbidity was 5.3% (95% CI: 4.3 – 6.5); among men 6.1% and 5.5% among women. After adjusting for age, for both women and men, being currently married, alcohol use, family history of diabetes and generalized obesity were associated with comorbidity. However, these associations were more robust for men. Moreover, measures of central obesity were associated with comorbidity for men alone. Though alcohol use was higher among men, the association with comorbidity was more robust for women. Paradoxically, lower educational status among women and higher education among men were associated with higher odds of comorbidity. In conclusion, prevalence of comorbid diabetes and hypertension may differ marginally among men and women. Though comorbidity rates appear to be lower in Nepal in comparison to other countries in South Asia, the rising burden emphasizes the need for tailored public health interventions that address modifiable risk factors among men and women. Further research may help to elucidate the role of gender on cardiovascular risk and hard outcomes such as cardiovascular events and mortality among persons with comorbid diabetes and hypertension.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/nmcj/article/download/60872/45506,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

For women entrepreneurs in Nepal, not only are they marginalised in their tourism business endeavours, they are also highly regulated by caste and class, and patriarchal inequality. Using a critical theoretical framework within a qualitative grounded theory approach, we revealed ways in which Nepali women subvert the institutionalised gender and power structures. The critical perspective engages with socially constructed layers of historical, political, cultural, economic and gender values that have been embedded over time. Sixteen Nepali women entrepreneurs in tourism were interviewed between 2014 and 2019. Patriarchal embeddedness in social, business and tourism environments are overcome by Nepali women through micro enterprise development. Women are engaging in female domains such as homestay, but also infiltrating male domains such as trekking and tour-guiding. Nepali women's political strategies are subtle and understated. The capacity of Nepali women to encroach on patriarchy through tourism shows that women have adapted to redress socially constructed imbalances. Tourism provided opportunities to find their agency in a world that has been largely silenced. Women's skills and roles are now infiltrating ingrained patriarchy.",,,SDG 5: Gender Equality

Nepal is a country with one of the widest gender gaps worldwide and required to improve girls' education. In our analysis, we find a higher wage gap in regular employment for rural workers, though the gap decrease in casual employment. Our results show that the gap is attributed with discrimination effects. We also find that women in rural areas have difficulty finding regular work, meaning that most are engaged in casual work or unemployment. This indicates that women in rural areas, despite high education levels on par with men or women in urban area, suffer from both large wage discrimination and less opportunity for finding regular work. This may explain the lower incentive to give education among rural girls in Nepal.",,,SDG 5: Gender Equality
