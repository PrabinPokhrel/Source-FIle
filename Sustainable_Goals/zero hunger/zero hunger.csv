To combat the culture of impunity, the conflict victims have actively worked together with human rights activists and civil society organisations. In exploring different phases and forms of their activism, the chapter demonstrates that they have creatively utilised a wide variety of methods, including peaceful protests, sit-ins, non-cooperation, hunger strikes, as well as civil disobedience to demand justice and challenge laws and policies they consider unjust or discriminatory. The chapter concludes that even though the conflict victims have not been able to compel the state to fulfil its responsibilities in making the perpetrators of the conflict era accountable, they have succeeded in articulating their dissatisfaction clearly in the public arena while building important networks and alliances and gaining support also from the international community. It is also remarkable that despite the legacy of violence, the conflict victims, human rights activists, and civil society actors have continually chosen to pursue justice through the nonviolent approach.",,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Methodologically, the paper uses a descriptive research design; for this, secondary sources of data were intensively reviewed, and it draws an insightful conclusion from a variety of literature. Collected data were presented and interpreted using descriptive statistical tools such as tables, figures, percentages, and trend lines. The paper’s scope is limited to the Nepalese context. Professional ethics, a minimum similarity index, and authenticity in data have been taken as ethical considerations. Around half of the households (48.2 percent) have access to food security over the course of the year in Nepal. The urban area is more secure than the rural, and the position of the Terai region is better than that of the hill and mountain regions in terms of food security status. In terms of food security and severe food insecurity, Gandaki Province performed well, while Karnali Province performed poorly. The fight against hunger has mostly stagnated internationally in recent years. The GHI score for 2022 is moderate, although at 19.1, it only slightly deviates from the 16.4 score in 2014, the 20.8 score in 2019, and the 19.5 score in 2020. Nepal's global hunger index trend is shifting from a serious to a moderate position. This paper suggests exploring future food security strategies and reducing the intensity of hunger through further research. This study would stimulate public interest in policy advocacy, which might result in widespread favorable policy initiatives for more in-depth discussions and the implementation of development strategies in developing countries like Nepal.",https://journalejnfs.com/index.php/EJNFS/article/download/1278/2557,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Most plant species consumed as food across the world are neglected and underutilized. These includes plants with edible fruits, grains, leaves, nuts, oils, roots and tubers, fibers, medicines, spices, stimulants and their derived products. Until now, there was very limited information available on the utility of plants for different purposes in the study area. Thus, to minimize the gaps, the research was carried out at Bhadaure village of Kaski District, Nepal. Data were collected from the different sites through the application of Participatory Research Appraisal methods i.e. direct observation, household survey, individual interviews and key informant interview. This was followed by the field visit with the help of community members where collection of the plant samples and capturing of the photograph was done. Then each species was evaluated for nine parameters (extent of the production, extent of consumption, degree of consumption, perceived nutritional value, cultural importance, medicinal properties, market use, market value and contribution to household income). From the community interaction and field visit a list of 66 plants were extracted as underutilized plants in the study area. They were from various habitats. About 55% of the species were collected from natural or semi-natural vegetation, particularly forest. 33% of the plants were used for vegetable. The collection or harvesting period of the recorded plant were varies on the case of species. The availability of wild plants has also declined drastically. Young generation was not so much interested in these plants. Some of these plants were observed on market places being sold at competitive prices. Specific household members consume these plants. Commercialization of these fruits is mainly undertaken by the low resource base farmers.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-37077-9_9,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

In Nepal, the targeted beneficiaries are less aware about importance of micronutrients (MNs), which has resulted in low intake of foods rich in MNs. Micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs) have huge impact on health of vulnerable population like women and children and have jeopardized the national economy and prosperity of developing countries including Nepal. However, less attention has been paid towards MNDs, which can be prevented. Therefore, this study aims to draw attention of the concerned authorities and researchers to combat against MNDs in Nepal. This study showed that different types of MNDs with higher prevalence exist in Nepal. The major causes of MNDs were poor diet, diseases and infestations, and poor health caring practices. The results of MNDs were unwanted child and maternal mortality, impairments of lives, and reduction in productivity and intellectual capacity. School health and nutrition education and supplementation and fortification of essential MNs proved to be effective while dietary diversification and economic growth and poverty eradication seemed promising. Control and prevention of MNDs can help to achieve Millennium Development Goals as well, so studies in this sector should be emphasized.",http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2015/276469.pdf,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

We further allow for differential nutrient demand response to income depending on where a household is in the caloric availability distribution. We find that some nutrients are income inelastic indicating that they are necessity goods while others are relatively income elastic. We further test and reject equivalent nutrient‐income elasticities across the caloric availability distribution. Households in the lowest calorie quintile have highly income elastic nutrient demand leaving them vulnerable to income fluctuations. Moreover, as households meet their first‐order caloric needs, they substitute away from cheap calorie‐dense staples toward more expensive nutrient‐dense foods. Finally, for most nutrients, households in the highest calorie quintile exhibit more elastic nutrient demand, similar to households in the lowest quintile. Our results suggest that policies aimed at improving income will likely also improve household nutrient availability, particularly for the most calorie poor households. They further suggest that policies aimed at protecting poor households from negative income shocks will also likely yield nutritional benefits.",https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fagec.12446,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

The authors also assess the contribution of scale-appropriate mechanization to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of zero hunger (SDG2) and no poverty (SDG1). Design/methodology/approach: Propensity score matching and doubly robust inverse probability-weighted regression adjusted methods were applied to estimate the effects of mini-tiller adoption. These methods control the biases that arise from observed heterogeneities between mini-tillers users and nonusers. Findings: The study findings show that farm size, labor shortages, draft animal scarcity, market proximity, household assets and household heads' educational level influence the adoption of mechanization in Nepal. Mechanized farms exhibited enhanced maize productivity, profits and household food self-sufficiency. Reduced depth and severity of poverty were also observed. Nevertheless, these effects were not uniform; very small farms (≤0.41 ha) facing acute labor shortages benefited the most. Research limitations/implications: The study results suggest that policymakers in developing nations like Nepal may wish to expand their emphasis on scale-appropriate mechanization to improve farm productivity and household food security, reduce poverty and contribute to the SDGs.

However, mainstreaming climate change issues into sectoral policies from the government can be seen as recent activities in Nepal. Nepal has contributed negligible amount of emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) of global greenhouse gas, it is the fourth most vulnerable country in the world. In this context, this paper aims to review climate change adaptation policies in terms of sectoral integration. This paper has adopted text-mining method for information retrieval and knowledge mining and followed step-by-step approach to undertake review of policies. It concludes that National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010 can be a milestone in sectoral adaptation of climate change issue largely because it has provided the national framework for sectoral adaptation to climate change. However, NAPA ignores the importance of structural and institutional reforms needed for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into sectoral agencies. Climate change Policy, 2011, Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) 2011, Constitution of Nepal, 2015, Local Government Operation Act (LGOA) 2017, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017 and National REDD+ Strategy, 2018 are other prominent legislative and policy frameworks that have significant contribution in sectoral integration of climate change adaptation issues. However, lack of climate change act in order to implement fully these policies into practice for its implementation can be a major obstacle to achieve the goal. In this context, strong legislative foundation with effective institutional mechanism among different sectors will be very crucial to capture the spirit of new Federal Constitution of Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23412/19841,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

However, there is a widespread view that young men and women are becoming more at ease in each other's company and beginning sexual experiences prior to marriage, putting them at risk of the consequences of unsafe sex. This research aims to evaluate the factors associated with premarital sexual behavior and its consequences among Nepalese college-going adolescents and youths. This cross-sectional web-based study included 415 Nepalese students over the age of 18 who were enrolled in a bachelor's degree program in a discipline other than health science. Data was collected from students online using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Pearson's chi-square (χ2) and logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between the independent and outcome variables. Most participants (61.7%) had dating experience and 21.2% had premarital sex. About three-fourths (76.1%) of participants had premarital sex before the age of 20 years and the ages of sexual debut ranged from 13 to 25 years. The major reasons for sexual debut were desire, curiosity, continuation of love relationship, and peer pressure. One-third of students (33.0%) reported having more than two sex partners, and 11.4% had intercourse with commercial sex workers. Among students who had premarital sex, 13.7% of participants or their sex partners, had to undergo abortions because of unintended pregnancies. Having an illiterate parent (AOR=11.0; 95% CI=2.01-60.87), high pocket money (AOR=4.2; 95% CI=1.1-16.2), increased dating culture (AOR=18.8; 95% CI=4.8-74.2), a close friend who has experienced premarital sex (AOR=5.2; 95% CI=2.21-12.21), and exposure to pornography (AOR=97.87; 95% CI= 9.5-10001.4) were predictors of premarital sex among Nepalese college students.

This study aims to assess the barriers to safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on building construction projects in Nepal. A total of 330 responses were collected from construction professionals in Nepal using a Likert scale. To ensure the data's suitability for factor analysis using Principal Component Analysis, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, Bartlett's Sphericity test, inter-component correlations, and Cronbach alpha scores for internal consistency were checked, and principal components were extracted. A 25-item safety barrier to safety measures in building construction projects during the COVID-19 pandemic was identified through an extensive review of the literature; six components were retained using Principal Component Analysis which represented the model of choice and explained 62.86 % of the data variance. The components were; inappropriate safety guidelines, psychological working pressure, inadequate hygiene monitoring and control, lack of safety awareness, improper working culture, and insufficient planning and scheduling. The internal consistency for the retained components was high; Cronbach α scores ranged from 0.72 to 0.796. “Inappropriate Safety Guidelines” was the most critical barrier to implementing safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in building construction projects, according to the rankings of the six identified components. It is recommended that construction professionals and regulatory bodies prioritize the development and adherence to robust safety protocols tailored to pandemic conditions. Regularly updating and reinforcing these guidelines will be crucial in safeguarding the health and well-being of workers while ensuring project continuity.

Institutional and Legislative Systems (ILS) approach has been adopted focusing on three aspects: i) legal and regulatory frameworks, ii) policies and programs, and iii) organizational/institutional set-up. This paper concludes that newly endorsed Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act (2017) can be a milestone in disaster management of Nepal not only because it has replaced about 40 years old Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 but also for the first time, it saw disaster risk management as an process focusing on different stages of disaster management cycles, preparedness, response and rehabilitation and mitigation. The provision of well-structured functional institutional set-up from the centre to local level can have positive outcome in disaster management. However, it overlooks significant aspect, such as the declaration of disaster-prone zones limiting the right of provincial disaster management committee only for recommendation to the Government of Nepal. Most of policies, strategies and legislations focused on some specific disasters such as flood, landslide, earthquake and GLOF/avalanches at national level paying less emphasis to the local level. Even now, most of the policy interventions towards different cycles of disaster risk management have laid emphasis on preparedness and response rather than to rehabilitation and mitigation. The conflicting provisions in Acts such as Water Resource Act (1992) and Building Act (1998) with Local Government Operation Act (2017) have made overlapping of their roles and responsibilities. So, the policy formulation and institutional set-up needs to be complemented by the ability and competence to operationalize the intent of the relevant acts and policies at all levels of government.The Geographical Journal of NepalVol. 11: 1-24, 2018 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/19546/16004,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

This paper aims to analyze the constraints and opportunities of vegetable farmers in Kirtipur. Altogether 80 farm household survey were conducted in four major areas of Kirtipur. A total of 20 key informant interviews (KII) were also conducted to understand the perception of farm households on commercial vegetable farming. The result shows that around 94% of the total sampled farm households have leasehold farmland that has spread to different settlements of Kirtipur Municipality. Out of total leasehold farmers, 69% have written agreement with the landowner. The result also shows that the farmers cultivate vegetables in an average area of 5.67 ropani (2884.49m2). Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) are the primary vegetable products, whereas cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) and other green leafy vegetables are mostly cultivated as secondary vegetable products. Dug wells are the major sources of irrigation on vegetable farmland. Out of the total sampled farm households, about 42% of farmers are associated with farmers group and 37% have basic training on vegetable farming. Majority of farmers have savings from vegetable production and marketing. Despite few constraints like price fluctuation (81%) and high middleman margins (71%), vegetable farming in Kirtipur has many opportunities particularly being a major source income and livelihood (93%), self-employment generation (87%) and growing market demand (83%). The opportunities in commercial vegetable farming have continuously attracted the farmers in Kirtipur; however, the existing constraints has deprived farmers from their expected returns. Therefore, this paper recommends to portray possible options to promote opportunities and overcome the existing constraints to retain commercial vegetable farming as a sustainable source for farm households in Kirtipur.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23418/19847,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Utilizing a descriptive research methodology, data was gathered through close-ended and open-ended questionnaires, case studies, and field observations across various impacted communities. Secondary data sources included existing literature on landless housing reconstruction and community-based initiatives. The findings reveal that the landless communities suffered greatly due to seismically vulnerable structures, lack of preparedness, and insufficient use of critical seismic features. These communities often lack access to vital information that could mitigate disaster risks. The study further explores how residents have innovatively rebuilt their homes by integrating safety measures, utilizing salvaged materials, and combining traditional knowledge with scientifically validated techniques.

Available data were collected from the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MoAD), Department of Agriculture (DoA) and Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC). Green house gas emission (GHG) was estimated by using IPCC 2006 guidelines. Agricultural activities contribute directly to emissions of greenhouse gases through a variety of processes including the source categories such as enteric fermentation in domestic livestock, livestock manure management, rice cultivation, and agricultural soil management. Diverse traditional agriculture systems, unique diversities in land types and unavailability of required disaggregated data at the national level as defined by the emission factor data base (EFDB) of the IPCC 2006, were the problem encountered while calculating the emission status in this study. Annual methane (CH4) emission from paddy fields ranged from 111.57 to 133.07 Gg over years 2000 to 2010 but it was found lowest ( 111.57 Gg) in the year 2002 and highest (133.07 Gg) in the year2003. In the year 2010, methane emission from paddy cultivation represented about 17.48 % of cumulative methane emission both from livestock sector and paddy fields throughout Nepal.

Niche specific commodities that have comparative advantage could be produced in fair quantity to meet the demand of huge market of neighboring India and China as purchasing capacity of people in those countries has improved markedly mainly for quality agriculture commodities. Trade deficit, food insecurity, income generation, poverty reduction, and employment generation could be addressed by turning present status of subsistence agriculture into robust, vibrant and commercial agriculture through technology led agro-industrialization. There are agro-commodities which are imported from India and other countries in huge quantity by the scarce hard currency earned through remittance. Evidence shows that almost 70% of the remittance is spent for agriculture commodities which have high potentiality to produce within the country even after local consumption. Such produce could be exported to other countries to mitigate trade imbalance, enhance export promotion and import reduction and promote graduating Nepal from LDC to DC within the stipulated time frame as proposed a couple of years ago by the government of Nepal.

The study shows that despite some initiatives by government, NGOs, bilateral agencies and media to improve land tenure security, land tenure insecurity prevails in all areas of the country even in registered lands. It is found that stable  rganization, registration of most of the built-up and cultivated land, advocacy to protect the right of landless has strengthened the land tenure security. However, the tenure rights of socially and economically disadvantaged people and displaced people from disasters have not been properly addressed and those people are at high risk of eviction from the place they are living.

Among them, the flood is one of the natural disasters and that occurred in the Narayani River basin. The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising. In order to effectively manage and prepare for potential flood hazards in the study area, an analysis of the flood risk assessment was conducted by taking into consideration three primary factors: the flood hazard map, flood exposure, and flood vulnerability. The layers of the population, crops, schools, hospitals, and road network were all exposed to flooding, and the factors that determined flood vulnerabilities were literacy, urban area, and agecomposition (less than 14 and more than 65). The higher flood risk area was found in Ward number 1, 3, 4,16,18,26 of Bharatpur metropolitan, Gaindakot municipality ward number 1 and 12, 15 of Madhyabindu Municipality.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-74923-1_822,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

In BPKIHS, junior resident doctors are one of the frontline health care professionals and are vulnerable to mental health problems. This study was undertaken to find out depression, anxiety, and stress in the frontline junior resident doctors (FJRD). METHODOLOGY A web-based cross-sectional study among FJRD was done from 29 August to 28 September 2020 using Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULT Among 168 FJRD, 144(85.7%) responded, and the mean age was 29.6±1.9 years. They were mostly male (56.9%), unmarried (60. 4%), living alone (77.1%), first-year junior residents (43.1%), and had last duty more than 2 weeks(56.9%). Anxiety was seen in 50%; followed by Depression in 38.1%; and Stress in 27.7%. The moderate type of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress was common which were 19.6%, 24.3% and 15.2% respectively. Depression, Anxiety and Stress was more in male (55 to 61.1%), unmarried (60-64%), living alone (76-85%) and first-year residents (37.5-43.6%) but not statistically significant. Depression, Anxiety and Stress were more in those whose last duty more than 2 weeks but statistically significant with Anxiety (p=0.03) only. There was a strong correlation among each other of depression, anxiety and stress (p=<0.05). CONCLUSION Depression, anxiety, and stress were greater in FJRD.

Imminent water crisis due to climate change, water demanding nature of traditionally cultivated rice, increasing scarcity of labor and escalating labor costs drive the search for alternative management methods to increase water productivity, system sustainability and profitability in rice cultivation. Direct seeded rice (DSR) technique has received much attention and popularity nowadays because of its low-input demanding nature that can mitigate emission of green-house gases and adaption to climatic risks. DSR involves sowing of dry seed into a prepared seedbed, pre-germinated seed into a puddled soil surface and standing water. The development of early maturing varieties and use of efficient nutrient management practices along with increased adoption of integrated weed management techniques have encouraged many farmers to switch from transplanted to DSR culture. DSR technology is highly mechanized in some developed countries like USA, Australia, Japan, China, Korea etc. This shift from traditional rice to DSR will substantially reduce crop water requirements, soil organic-matter turnover, enhanced nutrient management, carbon sequestration, weed management, greenhouse-gas emissions and enhance crop intensification. However, weed and nematode infestation, blast, panicle sterility, lack of suitable varieties for DSR and lodging are major challenges. Based on existing evidences, this paper reviews the integrated package of technologies for DSR, potential advantages and challenges associated with it.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44786/33689,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Regression equation is estimated to find factors influencing on output and factors affecting TFPG. Extended Cobb-Douglas production function is examined to find TFPG. As it is disclosed by efficiencies measures such as labor productivity, capital productivity and material efficiency, there is not coherent relation among efficiency measures and output rather than in few cases. It implies that  output increase due to many reasons such as protection, internal demand, availability of material input, comparative advantage and so on. As it is evident by the regression result; output is mainly interrelated with the inherent components like labour, capital and material input though road is also notices as positive factor. Liberalization dummy notifies negative impact on output. Improved TFPG at post liberalization phase is realized to those years in which capital is also increased which suggests increment tin capital probably with improved technology is required to increase overall efficiencies.

Compared to foreign direct investment (FDI) or foreign aid (grants & loans), the money injected to the economy of Nepal through remittances is markedly larger. Huge investment in the real estate sector and large sums of money applied for share subscription indicate the need and opportunities of channelizing remittances in the infrastructure development and productive sector. However, most studies on remittances are focused on the ex-post analysis of the economy and few studies focus on the planning and policy issues aimed to utilize remittances. This paper reviews literature on utilizing remittance money and analyzes the prospects of capitalizing remittances in Nepal. A conceptual model is proposed on utilizing remittance money for infrastructure development. The proposed model of a remittance investment trust aims to synergize the three best attributes of the three domains of stakeholders, namely, abundant remittance money of the people, excellent management skills of the private sector, and the superior public trust to the government. Remittance money can serve as a great investment vehicle for executing properly investigated and attractive infrastructure projects. As estimated for Lumbini province, the remittance investment trust may contribute to fulfill 20% of the deficit of investment towards achieving the sustainable development goals.

From 2000-2010 forest and waterbodies decreased by 3.87%, and 0.54% respectively whereas agriculture and other land increased by 1.7% and 2.71% respectively. Similarly, from 2010 to 2020, agriculture, water bodies, and other land decreased by 1.99%, 0.10%, and 4.48% whereas forests increased by 6.58% respectively. The overall accuracy of the map is 90%, 89% and 88% for the years 2000, 2010 and 2020.

An elasticity indicator shows 1% of land conversion in Siwalik resulted in 0.47 % and 0.21 % changes in ESVs during the two periods, respectively. Overall findings of this study, suggest that ESV has increased in the Siwalik region of Madhesh province in the last two decades, primarily due to an increase in forest cover.

Using data from the third wave of the Household Risk and Vulnerability Survey 2018, logistic regression is employed to analyze both the likelihood of LPG adoption and household expenditure on LPG under conditions of natural shocks. The findings reveal that households experiencing natural shocks are 5 percent less on average likely to adopt biogas or LPG. Furthermore, household expenditure on LPG decreases by 4.43 percent relative to cooking fuel expenses particularly for firewood by the households experiencing natural shocks. This reduction highlights a decline in the intensity of clean energy use among households concurrently using LPG and firewood.

Gini coefficient was used as analytical tool. As the results, 67 percent households are absolute poor and 23 percent households are relatively poor. The poor households excessively and directly dependent on the forest products of the community forests for their daily livelihood objectives. This study found that community forests contributed 45 percent livelihood income (firewood, leaf litter, and grass, water etc.) to the forest-dependent households, along with service and agriculture income sources. Labor contribution based proportional distribution was used to meet social and economic justice. The poor could get more benefit than the well-off households. Additionally, the study found declining inequality among households after being a member of KCF. Without the income of the community forests, the inequality was 0.99. With the income of the community forests, the inequality sharply dropped at 0.64. Thus, the community forests reduce income inequality and poverty level of the poor households with increasing livelihood security and support.

A well-developed stock market could promote the volume of domestic savings, saving mobilization, capital formation, and efficient allocation of capital in productive sectors of the economy that ultimately helps for increasing income, output, and employment and thereby enhance the economic growth of the nation. The study followed quantitative analysis and deductive method by using secondary data of 27 years from 1994 to 2021. It used ARDL model, co-integration test, bound test, CUSUM, and CUSUMQ test for data analysis. It employs the real gross domestic product as a proxy variable for economic growth while broad money supply, market capitalization, stock market turnover, NEPSE index, and listed companies are taken as the indicator of stock market development. The study found that there is a significant contribution of broad money supply, market capitalization and NEPSE index to real GDP. But, there is a weak contribution of stock market turnover to real GDP that indicates a liquidity problem in Nepalese stock market. It concludes that stock market development has a significant contribution for economic growth in Nepal. Hence, it is suggested that policymakers should think about the stock market development for the economic growth of Nepal. ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/55025/42206,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Employees Provident Fund, Citizen Investment Trust, and Social Security Funds are three major competing institutions in the social security market in Nepal. This paper explores the investment of funds accumulated through the contribution of employees for value creation as a means to enhance financial viability and further assesses the long-term sustainability of such programmes. The study is based on reviewing and analyzing the documents relating to the defined objectives and targets, investment policies, investment portfolio, legal framework for investment, and achievements. The study finds that all three social security institutions (SSIs) end up investing the accumulated funds in fixed deposits in the banking and financial institutions (BFIs.). This is despite the act empowering them to mobilize the accumulated funds in several productive sectors and set competitive investment goals. This indicates that they fail to explore productive avenues for sustainable investment of the accumulated funds, which could contribute to the economic development of the nation. The current challenges in the social security system in Nepal are the increasing number of pensioners and the need for sustainable investment; making it imperative for the Nepalese SSIs to evaluate their investment priority; feasibility and diversify for higher and long-term returns; focusing on areas that contribute to economic growth and development; and generating employment opportunities.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/68022/52144,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

The government has been spending a significant portion of its budget on imports, and it aims to reduce this dependence by increasing domestic production and achieving food security goals. To understand the dynamics of this issue, system dynamics modelling steps were employed. The key variables considered in the model testing were domestic production, imports, per capita consumption, productivity per hectare, and average area expansion rate. The study utilized time series data from 1991 to 2020 and projected the analysis up to 2050 using Stella Architect, a computer-based software program. The findings reveal that both the population and imports have exhibited exponential growth over the years. The model also indicates goal-seeking behaviour, with the government setting targets for yield increment based on available harvest areas. However, the policies implemented thus far have mostly been quick-fix approaches focusing input subsidized programs. According to the model, an increase of 70-100% in rice production will be required by 2050 to meet the growing population's demand. The study presents three policy options for achieving rice self-sufficiency: 1) a 2% annual increase in average area expansion, 2) raising productivity from 3700 kg ha-1 to 5000 kg ha-1 and 3) increasing productivity to 3900 kg ha-1 while reducing per capita rice consumption from 200 kg to 130 kg. The study suggests that adopting the recommended policy implications can help increase rice production in Nepal. Decision-makers should adopt a dynamic approach to the rice production system to address the issue of slow growth and achieve national self-sufficiency and food security goals.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/62168/46954,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Studies on CA under Nepal’s rainfed farming systems of Terai and hills of Nepal improved the soil quality, increased individual crop and system yields, reduced labor demand and was economically profitable. However, lack of adequate soil moisture during planting in initial seasons, inadequate tillage equipment and weed management options are the key constraints of rainfed farming to be transformed into CA in initial stages.

Thanju on my article ‘Water Resources of Nepal: Misconception and Reality’ published in The Rising Nepal on January 23 & 24, 2014.The rivers of Nepal possess sufficient hydropower potentiality to enhance the country’s socio-economic development. However, some spurious expert and vested interest group exaggerated the hydro potentiality and distorted the fact of water resources development prospective in Nepal. This has created confusion among the policymakers, politician and multilateral agencies. As a result, hydropower development in Nepal has headed for wrong course, and now the power sector, the vital impetus for socio-economic development is in dire strait. This paper highlights the uniqueness and distinct technical features of Nepalese Power Sector. In this paper important component like Integrated National Power System/Grid (INPS), Power Generation Modality (Hydropower, Thermal/Nuclear Plants and Diesel Plants) are well described and Master Plan, Project Selection, Construction Schedules and Hydropower potentiality of Nepal are discussed in detail. In a severe power and energy crisis situation in the country, power export is not recommended. Nepal needs 3000 MW to reach the level of other south Asian nations. INPS is owned and operated by NEA; therefore NEA also has the responsibility to prepare master plan for power generation, transmission and distribution. But, the Department Electricity Development a regulatory body of Ministry of Energy of is undertaking / carrying out feasibility study without taking care of INPS/country’s power requirement. This has created duplication of work and confusion; as such the Ministry of Energy deviated from its responsibility of preparing sound policy, regulation and monitoring them strictly. The Ministry shouldn’t indulge in feasibility study, construction and operational activities, which come under the responsibility of concerned technical department /authority.

Focusing on functional place dependence, it analyses place attachment within the Panipokhari Integrated Settlement, designed for the Thami community in Dolakha district. Using ""residential satisfaction"" as a parameter to measure the influencing factors of place dependence, data were collected through a Likert scale survey, interviews, and observations. The analysis encompassed Cronbach's Alpha for reliability (α = 0.825), mean satisfaction scores for evaluation, and Spearman’s rank correlation to explore relationships between residential satisfaction parameters and place dependence factors. The study revealed significant correlations, highlighting varied influences on place attachment. Notably, social connectivity, represented by nearness to relatives (r = 0.720, p = 0.000), exhibited a strong positive correlation. Similarly, infrastructure amenities like electricity (r = 0.532, p = 0.000) displayed a relatively strong positive correlation, while access to health facilities (r = 0.447, p = 0.002) demonstrated a moderate positive correlation.

It is generally believed that remittances have positive effects on volume of imports. On the contrary, if there is more imports than exports, it may run out trade deficit. It does make negative impact on the exchange rate of the home country. A weaker currency can raise the value of remittances sent back to the country, encouraging migrants to send more money home that influenced in growth of remittance.

The government and household members of the country of origin have been taking the maximum possible advantages of remittances in various fields, and it is becoming a more stable source of external finance. However, around 80 percent of remittance received by households is used only for consumption purposes in Nepal. Despite the increasing importance of remittance in the Nepalese economy, the relationship between remittance and private consumption has not yet been adequately studied. Hence, the prime objective of this paper is to analyze the effects of remittance on private consumption expenditure in Nepal. The ARDL bounds testing model is employed in the study to identify the effects of remittance on private consumption in Nepal. The time series data for 20 years, 2001-2020, are collected from various government sources, such as the Ministry of Finance, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), and the National Statistics Office. This study finds a positive and significant relationship between remittances and private consumption in Nepal.

As well, businesses and the government would need to move quickly to produce a more favorable environment for job creation. However, for this transformation to happen pronouncedly, we need to know what additional fisheries technologies would best suit to enhance substantial production under putative climate changes and stimulating socioeconomics for more job and income opportunities.

Bringing the time series trade data from reliable sources, this study also attempts to highlight import dependency ratio, correlation of population and GDP per capita growth with total import and pin down plausible reasons behind these pictures. The correlation study between import data to population growth and GDP per capita showed a positive correlation with r values 0.71 (p<0.05) and 0.99 (p<0.05), respectively. National supply sides when combine with domestic production mimics aggregate rice demands and these figures show increasing patterns accompanied by growing imports together with import dependency ratio. India alone dominates the rice trade which accounts for more than 90 percent of Nepal’s import in recent years. These noticeable surges in rice imports can be attributed to liberal trade policies of the respective trade partner countries, improvement in incomes, closer proximity, similar languages, and consumer preferences among others. Opening a domestic market for rice cannot be denied theoretically in favor of welfare-improving policy tools, however, it should be carefully considered to protect local farmer’s concerns. Though growth in rice productivity is encouraging over the recent previous years, there is ample potential to increase further by integrated programs combining expansion of spring paddy, inputs, irrigation, and technology. Moreover, attention should be paid toward consumer’s fine rice preferences aligning farmer’s motivations. The introduction of fiscal policy with application of tariff or non-tariff measures at least for a few years can encourage the domestic rice industry. Above policy adjustment can drive Nepal toward its rice self-reliant footing.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44796/33691,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

The data of 348 pigs, born over a period of fifteen years (1990 to 2004) were used to study the effect of non-genetic factors on reproductive traits and estimate their genetic parameters. The findings revealed that the   overall gestation length and farrowing intervals were 113.7 ± 0.12 days and 182.5 ± 2.2 days, respectively. Season of birth and parity of dams were not important sources of variation for reproductive traits, where as year affected these traits significantly. Heritability estimates of gestation length was low (0.02 ± 0.094), but heritability for farrowing interval was moderate (0.14 ± 0.147) suggesting selection based on farrowing interval would bring the improvement in the trait.Nepal Agric.

If one looks at the total quantum of water that flows out of Nepal in one year, the above message sounds valid but as the flow of water is not under anybody’s control and flow occurs under gravity as it precipitates or exits the water springs, it should be considered in two dimensions: volume and time. In my opinion, Nepal is water stressed most of the time of year: flood stressed during the monsoon and drought stressed during the rest of the year. Nepal is rich in ice-mass, which is depleting at an alarming rate due to global warming giving rise to formation and increase in volume of glacial lakes that increases the vulnerability and risks to the economic activities along the river basins. Similarly, Nepal is rich ing round water resource with the total annual replenish able reserve of about 12 BCM mostly located in the Terai plains. The most debatable is the surface water that mostly falls as rain during the monsoon and cascades down crossing into India, is often devastating, as it passes. Nepal’s water resource is generally related to its hydropower potential calculated as 83,000MW by Dr. Hari Man Shrestha back in the sixties. Hydropower potential is a number that is based on the energy potential and the market, therefore, it is changing from time to time due to change in demand pattern and the market rates. Myopic view of looking at the Himalayan waters relating it to energy production as the energy production (TAF-June 2018) comprises a meager percentage of total benefit which lies mostly on multiple use of water directed towards the following two aspects: (1)Reduction in the losses of life and property due to floods and unwanted mountain phenomenon, mostly flood related disaster risk reduction, and (2) Flood Water management for converting the curse of floods into assets by way of its multiple uses, both consumptive as well as non-consumptive including food revolution, navigation, fishery, water supply, replenishment of ground water, energy production and recreation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/24569/20671,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

The present study attempts to assess the vulnerability of the community due to climate change for which Chiti area of Besisahar Municipality from Lamjung district of Nepal was selected as the study area. The climate change vulnerability was assessed using the Long Term Research Program (LTRP). The long term climate change vulnerability household surveys from 2014 baseline data to 2016, 2017 and 2019 data were analysed in this study. This study adapted IPCC (2001) methodology i.e. also used by C4 EcoSolutions on their baseline climate change vulnerability assessment. This is a bottom-up, integrative approach that considers both physical and social dimensions at a local level. Consequently, vulnerability is best understood as a function of three components: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Exposure to climate change vulnerability is calculated with sum of changes in temperature, changes in rainfall patterns, changes in rainfall intensity, drought episodes and flooding events. Sensitivity is calculated based on slope failures, soil fertility, changes in natural environment (i) soil cover; ii) levels of river sedimentation; iii) water salinity; iv) river ecosystems; v) forest size; and vi) the presence of invasive species), economic dependency level, irrigation facilities and livelihood sources. The major finding is that Chiti has been facing climate change since last decade and it is found severely vulnerable due to climate change. There is an urgent need of improvement on climate change adaptive capacity which could result of awareness, information on climate change and adaptation, surplus production and change in agricultural practices. The present study has used awareness score based on conceptual awareness, experiential awareness, and engagement of household to talk about climate change and adaptation. The Long Term Research Approach is appropriate to assess climate change vulnerability in community level. Climate change awareness is one of the major components to reduce vulnerability to climate change in the research area.

Current neonatal mortality rate of Nepal is 21/1000 live birth which is higher than that of the global average of 19.2 and slightly lower than the regional (South East Asia). Pathogenic strains of neonatal sepsis varies from place to place and also from time to time, so it is very important to know the common pathogens and its resistant pattern locally. The aim of this study is to find out the hospital based frequency of neonatal sepsis and characterize the bacteriological profile along with their sensitivity and resistance pattern. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study done in Kanti Children Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal over the period of one year starting from July 2018 to June 2019.All culture positive cases were enrolled in the study and their sensitivity pattern were analyzed. Results were expressed as percentage, mean, P-Value and Odds Ratio. Results: A total of 107 cases were culture positive among 1064 probable sepsis accounting 10.05%.

Lockdown is considered to be an effective measure in slowing the spread of coronavirus. The study expects to understand community and healthcare providers’ perspectives on COVID-19 and pandemic responses during and after the lockdown in Nepal. Methods and material: Data were collected through telephone interviews with six representatives of community-based organizations and nine healthcare providers, and the collation of information about COVID-19 from social media, news outlets and government announcements. Data were thematically coded and analyzed according to the themes. Results: Although rapid dissemination of educational information through various social media was found, people reported an information overload on COVID-19 while questioning the authenticity of their sources. Several misbeliefs on the COVID-19 virus are rooted in the Nepalese community. Lockdown for a longer period was deemed an unsustainable preventive measure that directly impacted the income source of daily-wage workers. The fear of contracting coronavirus among healthcare providers at their workplaces was further triggered by the poor working conditions and non-availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). In fighting the pandemic, screening and management of other health issues were ignored. Conclusion: The prevention measures against COVID-19 are important for the local context, however, the communities need access of basic commodities and access to reliable information to enable them to follow these measures.

The present study aims to find the relationship between gross motor function and nutritional status in these children by comparing the proportion of stunting, wasting and under-weight between the various levels of gross motor function. Methods: Our study was across- sectional study conducted on 82 cases of cerebral palsy between one to five years of age visiting Kanti Children’s Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from May 2017 to September 2018. Their level of gross motor function was ascertained by applying the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and anthropometry was done using standard methods. On the basis of their motor function, the children were divided into two categories: those with poorer motor function who had poor self-mobility even with assistance (GMFCS level 4 and 5) and those with better motor function who had self-mobility with various degrees of assistance (GMFCS level 1, 2 and 3). Wasting, stunting and under-weight were compared between the two categories and odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was estimated for malnutrition. Results: The children belonging to poorer motor function were more likely to be underweight (Odds ratio 3.41; CI 1.36-8.52; p-value 0.008) and stunted (Odds ratio 3.9; CI 1.47-10.53; p-value 0.048) than those with better motor function. Conclusions: Children with poorer motor function are more likely to develop malnutrition (Specially stunting) than those with better motor function indicating that chronic form of malnutrition is more common in these children.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNPS/article/download/38130/37038,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Many hill villages are situated on or adjacent to unstable slopes and old landslides are reactivated from time to time. The rapidly increasing construction of infrastructure, such as roads, irrigation canals, and dams without due consideration of natural hazards is contributing to triggering of landslides and debris flows. Thus, this paper has explored the cause and characteristics of landslides occurrences and their mitigation practices in Nepal. Topographic, geologic and triggering factors, and human intervention causing landslides are characterised to suggest the suitable mitigation options that can be implemented in the mountain hill-slopes. Among the wide range of slope stabilisation measures which are available to practitioner engineer, the lowering of groundwater level in combination of controlling of surface infiltration (e.g. sealing of tension cracks) of water into landslide are the most cost effective options for mountainous terrain because the rise in pore water pressure is one of the basic cause of landslides during the rainy season. In addition, removing of unstable slope debris, surface drainage, and retaining walls are the useful landslide mitigation measures depending on site conditions, availability of budget, and specific requirements.

The study was carried out in Nasikasthan Sanga of Kavrepalanchok district of Nepal. Soil samples were collected from fields under improved conventional practice. Samples were taken at 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths and were analyzed for various physico-chemical properties to  compare the fertility status of the soils under both the practices. Altogether 68 farmers were interviewed to have information on farming practices and information pertinent to improved soil management practice being adopted by them. Results from soil physico-chemical analysis showed higher fertility of soils under improved practice in terms of more favorable pH level,  contents of exchangeable bases, available phosphorus and soil organic matter compared to prevailing conventional soil management practice. Moreover, majority of the farmers believed that soil fertility and physical condition of their upland soils had improved and that the productivity of major upland  crops had also increased after the adoption of improved soil management practice. Improved practice could play an important role in the sustainable management of upland soils in the mid hills of Nepal. It is however, desirable to conduct long-term research to further ascertain the effect of the practice on soil fertility of different soil types and land uses.Nepal Agric. Res. J.

The author conducted detailed geological studies and mineral exploration in some of the copper and polymetallic prospects and also reviewed the literature related to copper prospects in Nepal. The present research is able to delineate two distinct copper ore mineralization belts extending from west to east and identify the promising sites for copper ore and polymetallic mineralization that could be feasible for mining. The northern mineralization belt lies close to the Main Central Thrust where the mineralization occurs mostly in metamorphic rocks of garnet amphibolite facies in Darchula,Bajhang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Solukhumbu and Ilam districts. The southern mineralization belt in the Lesser Himalaya occurs in low-grade metamorphic rocks of greenschist facies in Dadeldhura, Rukum, Baglung, Myagdi, Tanahun, Dhadhing, Makwanpur, Dolakha, Udaypur, Bhojpur and Ilam districts. Most of these prospects were locally exploited on a small scale by traditional mining before 1951. Almost all mineralization in both belts is related to hydrothermal dissemination, irregular multiple vein type, replacement and cavity fillings and only a few polymetallic mineralizations at the exo-contact zone of granite bodies. The ore minerals were concentrated during the processes of regional metamorphism at the time of Himalayan upheaval. In general, the copper content in the northern belt appears to be higher in grade and tonnage as compared to the southern belt. The frequent association of tungsten, molybdenum, bismuth, nickel, tin, lead, zinc ores and traces of gold suggests the urgent need for further detailed exploration and evaluation of selected prospects which could be economic deposits and feasible for mining.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57919/43295,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Similarly, seed priming and weed management trails were conducted in RCBD with ten treatments. All the experiments were replicated three times. The highest seed yield of lentil was recorded from the early maturing lentil varieties, i.e. PL 4 (934  kg ha–1) and ILL 7979 (864 kg ha–1). Similarly, lentil sowing on October (940 kg ha–1) produced the higher seed yield than sowing on November (682  kg ha–1). Likewise, the highest seed yield of lentil was recorded from the use of seeding rate 60 kg ha–1 (890 kg ha–1), but it was statistically at par with the seeding rates of 40 kg ha–1 (865 kg ha–1) and 50 kg ha–1 (855 kg ha–1). Differently, the seed yield of lentil didn’t differ significantly under line (856 kg ha–1) and broadcasting (847 kg ha–1) methods of sowing.

The main aim of this study is to identify and evaluate the durability characteristics of some sandstones against slaking, freezing-thawing and abrasion. Lithosomes were characterized in the field. The following laboratory tests included measurements of dry density, specific gravity, water absorption, Slake Durability Index (SDI), Sulphate Soundness (SS), and Los Angles Abrasion (LAA). Sandstones from the Lower Siwalik Subgroup (LSS) are massive to cross-stratified, very fine- to medium-grained, and occasionally calcareous, whereas the sandstone from the Middle Siwalik Subgroup (MSS) are mostly cross-stratified to few massive, medium- to coarse-grained with salt-and-pepper appearance, and uncommonly calcareous. Sandstones have four different types of deterioration and had high to extremely high SDI. The majority of the sandstones have displayed similar slaking tendencies. Under the five-cycle SS test, the majority of sandstones from LSS and MSS have experienced low final weight loss (below 10%). However, two from LSS and three from MSS have experienced greater final weight loss. The LAA values range from 29.66% to 99.14%, and except two sandstones from LSS, rest of the samples have exceeded 45% abrasion showing they were incompetent in terms of abrasion test, and are highly susceptible to abrasion. The uniformity factor ranges from 0.21 to 0.44 indicating that all the sandstones were of non-uniform hardness.

The abuse of political power in manipulating fiscal and monetary policies by the ruling party prior to the election period has become normal in developing countries like Nepal. The incumbent tries to convince their voters by increasing the size of the populist public expenditure before or during the election period. Nepal can’t be exceptional in the case of public resource manipulation during the time of the election. Democracy was restored in Nepal after the people’s political movement of 1990 and after that six consequent general elections were completed.

Nepali city leaders are also aspiring to make their cities smart. A smart city basically has clever improvements made in three sectors of its operations: technological, human, and institutional. Globally, many cities have recently made impressive enhancements in at least one or more of these areas. Nepal’s National Planning Commission (NPC) in 2016 had released a concept paper on smart cities for Nepal, defining smart cities as sustainable, information and technology-based, with high quality services and replicable (NPC 2016). As most Nepali cities still operate with limited infrastructure, services, and amenities, making them smart is a challenging task. However, some elements of a smart city can be incrementally and selectively implemented by the Nepali urban governments. This paper assesses the successes and challenges in some of the smart cities globally, and as an example assesses the pollution reduction and efficiency impact of adopting a bus-rapid transit system in Nepal. It is seen that a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system for the Kathmandu Valley consisting of electrical buses, will drastically reduce air pollution, and improve mobility for the residents. Urban leaders in Nepal can begin to identify such a transit related and other smart elements to be gradually implemented in their cities which will improve efficiency of urban services, enhance quality of life for the urban residents, and promote sustainability of the overall urban system.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/45769/35807,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

About 56% of the households receive remittances, the country also has high rates of undernutrition as 36% of children under five years of age are stunted. Remittance are known to increase household income, potentially contributing to improvements in health and nutrition of children, but few studies have examined it in the Nepalese context. Methods: We used data of 2,498 children under 5 years of age from the Nepal Living Standard Survey 2010/11 to investigate associations between childhood stunting and household remittances. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of child stunting by remittances received by the families in the 12 months preceding the survey. Guided by a conceptual framework, the model was adjusted for variables representing child, maternal and household level characteristics. Results: Our investigation showed that the odds of a child being stunted decreased with increased levels of remittance received by households, 67% (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.67) lower for households receiving more than Nrs.60,000 remittance per year. However, there was no difference in the risk of stunting by gender of the household head and income categories.Conclusions: An increased household income could potentially reduce the burden of chronic undernutrition in poor families in Nepal, which in turn paves a path for the expansion of cash transfer programs. Further research is indicated to understand the threshold of remittance or cash transfer needed to estimate nutritional outcomes.Keywords: Income; nutrition; remittance; stunting",,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Understanding the genetic variability of MAP, strains are important in diagnosis, epidemiological investigation, and therefore the formation of strategies for prevention and control of the disease. Thus, this study was designed to grasp the molecular characterization of MAP isolates of Nepal, as pioneer research of this area. Total of 46 MAP isolates obtained from cattle population of three different locations of dairy pocket areas of Chitwan, Nepal were typed using IS1311 polymerase chain reaction-restriction endonuclease analysis (PCR-REA) to research the MAP genotype of Nepal. The extracted DNA samples (n=46) were analyzed for the presence of MAP specific sequences (IS900) using PCR and DNA samples were further subjected to genotype differentiation using IS1311 PCR-REA and IS1311 L2 PCR-REA methods. All the DNA samples were positive for the entire three MAP specific sequences based PCRs. This study revealed that ‘Bison type’ strain is the single most prevalent MAP genotype circulating within the domestic cattle population of Nepal. IS1311 PCR-REA showed that MAP DNA samples of Nepal origin belonged to ‘Bison type’, whereas, IS1311 L2 PCR-REA method showed similarity with ""Indian Bison type"" and different restriction profiles of ‘Bison type’ genotype as compared to non-Indian strains. The study concludes that in Nepal, ""Bison type"" MAP stains was prevalent in all the MAP samples obtained from dairy cattle.

Nepal is strewn with highly expensive development failures that have lined the pockets of Western consultants and companies, as well as less-than-honest domestic decision makers (see Chapters 3, 4 and 10). These include the infamous Arun 3 dam and similarly large hydro projects, often pushed by the World Bank and other aid donors (Chapter 8).

Phenomenologists concentrate on the structures of consciousness as individuals experienced and expressed while turning an objective world or phenomenon into a subjective one through objectivation, internalization and externalization/ institutionalization process. The structuralist holds that the creation of an institution is a reproduction of interaction between structures and actors. And other theorists (e.g., Leach et al., 1999; Ostrom 2005, 2009; Gupta et al., 2010; Young, 2010) consider that institutions for natural resources conflate with social institutions and mediate their relations. Although these theories are not explicit epistemologically in a pragmatic sense, they have indicated language, rules, (embedded) practices and knowledge are the referential artifacts of institutions. These theories are found applicable in the institutionalization/socialization history of CF as it had gone through the social rejection (i.e, objectivation) during the 1970s, internalization during the 1980s, and socialization of it during and after the 1990s. The socialization of CF after the 1990s was due to the formation of CF as a social space (a ‘structure’ or ‘institution’) to discuss social and environmental issues into one place where forest dependent users (‘actors’) rationalize the use of forest and its conservation for local environment in a more pragmatic sense (i.e., mediate people-nature relations). An institution for natural resources is, therefore, the combined perspectives of phenomenologists, structuralists, and those who think institutions as a mediator of people-nature relations. Thus, an institution is political (i.e., relations and interactions) and ecological/economic (i.e., access to natural resources, livelihood practices).",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/35547/27788,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

The research site, with an area of 278.324 km2, consists of parts of the Kaski, Parbat, and Syangja Districts. A Statistical Index Method was used for hazard analysis that produced weights. Positive weight values for each factor class represented a higher hazard and vice versa. An inventory of the study area identified 556 landslides measuring 1.511 km2 indicating a landslide density of 2 per km2 area. Thirteen percent (36.18 km2) of the total experimental area was rated as a very high hazard zone. Similarly, the area occupied by high hazard and moderate hazard zones were 77.66 km2 (28%), and 81.83 km2 (29%) respectively. The validation showed that the method can produce results with of accuracy of 82.8%. This indicated the hazard assessment process is acceptable and replicable. The factor classes having greater influence for higher landslide hazard are: near the streams, near the roads, barren or grassland, land with phyllite bedrocks, land receiving rainfalls greater than 4,000 mm, lands with an elevation range from 1,000 m to 1,500 m, slopes steeper than 30°, and south-facing slope.

Globally, the unsafe abortion accounts for 13% maternal deaths. Out of the total aborted women, around five million women were admitted to hospitals as a result of unsafe abortion. Similarly, more than three million women suffer from severe complications from unsafe abortion every year. In 2002, responding to the public voices and high attribution of unsafe abortion on maternal mortality, Nepal granted legal access to safe abortion introducing safe abortion act. Women can seek abortion up to 12 weeks of gestation for any indication. However, sex selective pregnancy termination is prohibited in Nepal.

Despite the considerable progress, unsafe abortion is still a major issue in Nepal as it has been estimated that it constitutes half of all abortions undertaken every year. Published literature further showed that still an unmet need of safe abortion services exists in Nepal. However, the overall awareness of legal abortion was found to be high among Nepalese women.

Remittances to Nepal rose dramatically in response to the earthquake by 20.9 percent in 2015 versus 3.2 percent in 2014. There is also a correlation between the level of remittance and hardship. The paper uses inflation as an indicator of ‘Financial Hardship’ to analyse the role of altruistic motives as a determinant of inflow of remittances. When prices of goods and services increase in the home country, the workers send more money to support their families. The Engel-Granger cointegration test is used to assess the short-run and the long-run relationship between inflation and remittances. Inflation does not affect remittances in the short run, however, there is the long-run relationship between remittances and inflation.

A randomized complete block design (RCBD) consisting of four treatments and five replications were used for the study. The treatments consisted of different levels of phosphorous viz. 0 Kg ha-1 (control), 20 Kg ha-1, 40 Kg ha-1 and 60 Kg ha-1. Black gram var. BLG 0093-1 was sown at spacing of 40 cm x 5 cm in the plots sized 8 m2. All the growth parameters and yield obtained from each treatment were compared at 5% level of significance. The results showed significantly greater number of branches (13.84), flower buds (11.33), root length (16.27 cm) and secondary roots (16.05) at 60 Kg phosphorus per ha followed by 40 Kg ha-1. However, plant height, pods per plant, seeds per pod, weight of pods per plant, biomass and grain yield showed non-significant results at similar levels of phosphorus (60 Kg ha-1). Though non-significant, higher number of fruiting branch, number of nodules, effective nodules, 1000 grain weight and harvest index were observed at 40 Kg ha-1 phosphorus. The findings suggested a gradual increase in the yield with increasing levels of phosphorus with the highest gross return from 60 Kg ha-1 phosphorus. However, since the variation in grain yield among the treatments was not significant, the cost involved with the 60 Kg ha-1 was greater as compared to 40 Kg ha-1 phosphorus, greater benefit was observed with the latter. So, on grounds of greater net return and better BC ratio, 40 Kg ha-1 phosphorus seems to be more profitable for the farmers.",https://nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/70858/54013,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

The decision of hysterectomy is not an easy one as not doing it could lead to death whereas the surgery results in permanent loss of ability to bear a child and this too in a young woman. Methods: This was a prospective study done over a period of 16 years from 1997 to 2013 by following all cases that underwent hysterectomy for obstetric causes during or after delivery and up to 6 weeks after delivery, in Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal. The various factors were analyzed and data presented in percentages, means and odds ratio was calculated as necessary. P value less than 0.05 was taken as significant. Results: The emergency peripartum hysterectomy rate was 0.05%. Placental abnormality was the most common indication (42.6%) followed by uterine atony (35.7%) and uterine trauma (17.9%). Cesarean Hysterectomy accounted for 50% of the cases. In the last 16 years there was an increased trend of Cesarean section from 18.6% to 30.7% which coincided with an increased Cesarean Hysterectomy from 36.4% in the initial 8 years to 58.8% in the last 8 years. Placental abnormalities as an indication increased over uterine atony in the last 8 years. The most common risk factor was Cesarean section (71.4%) followed by placental abnormalities (42.8%) and previous abortion in 32.1% cases. Conclusion: Emergency Peripartum Hysterectomy rate was 0.05%. Increasing Cesarean section rates were associated with increasing Cesarean Hysterectomy rates.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/551/514,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

There can exist a considerable difference in the position between local and the global system and the difference could be of several hundred meters.  Based on the availability of data three sets of transformation parameters has been determined. The tests have been carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the transformation parameter in this region. The transformation parameter is recommended to transform the topographical data base of scale 1: 3500 and smaller. The accuracy of the transformation parameters are specified and can be used accordingly.

According to the estimates provided by the UN Maternal Mortality Inter-agency Group (MMEIG), the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) started from a high of 901 in 1990, dropping to 258 in 2015, or a reduction of 71% over the 25 year period. Between 2000 and 2015, MMEIG estimates showed a reduction of 53%. The MMR is targeted to be reduced to at least to 70 by 2030. This implies a reduction of 73%, which is considerably higher than the reduction recorded during the earlier (2000-2015) period (which was 53%), or annualized rate of decline of 8.7% v 5.0%. Therefore, the future trajectory warrants undertaking strategic interventions more intensively than what may have been hitherto. Concurrently, more attention also needs to be given to strengthening the recording and reporting of maternal deaths.Keywords: levels and trends; maternal mortality; Nepal; projections",,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

In Nepal few studies have evaluated anaemia amongst patients suffering from heart failure. We intended to find out the prevalence of anaemia in patients with heart failure in a tertiary care centre. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among patients of heart failure presenting to tertiary care hospital in eastern Nepal from April 2017 to January 2018. Ethical approval was taken from the Institutional Review Committee of a tertiary care centre (reference number: IRC/0842/016). Using the convenience sampling method, 100 patients were enrolled in the study. Blood samples from the patients were taken for haemoglobin and serum iron studies. Data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 11. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated, with frequency and percentage. Results: Among 100 patients with heart failure, 82 (82%) (74.47-89.53 at 95% Confidence Interval) had anaemia. Mean haemoglobin level of the study population was 10.40±2.73 g/dl.

The wide and increasing availability of census and socio-economic data, tools like GIS with an ease to use and advances in methodology has allowed increasing and refined GIS mapping of census variables. However, it is less emphasized that the result of analysis and presentation is always dependent on the unit of analysis. Data aggregation, choice of data classification method and spatial scale all have effect on mapping result. When administrative boundaries are restructured, it necessitates the aggregation of census data of one administrative level to another. In this context, the current paper explores the scale and zoning effect (changing boundary, changing number of units and data aggregation) on mapping census data. It explores the effect of four data classification methods at two spatial scales. Secondary data sources like local administrative boundary of Bajhang district and economically active population in agriculture is selected as representative census variable for mapping. GIS tool is applied for data mapping and analysis. The study found the higher calculated correlation value (0.88) for the restructured spatial units. The distribution of number of spatial units varied significantly between four data classification methods while plotted against the old boundary but there was not much variation in case of newly restructured boundary. The study found that zoning particularly, from smaller to larger units has blurred the spatial pattern visualization leading to a loss of the preferential information. The study concludes that the restructuring of administrative boundaries into larger unit has simplified the detail for spatial representation and has introduced additional generalization. For policy level analysis, use of data available at one level of the spatial unit when aggregated to higher level should be analyzed carefully using different data classification methods and visualization tools because scaled spatial representation matters in planning and policy aspect. It is meaningful to analyze data at different spatial scale to visualize and identify spatial variation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23413/19842,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

The causes are rural to urban migration and addition of municipalities by merging a number of rural areas. During the restructuring of the state, Government of Nepal declared 293 as municipalities among 753 local government units. Considering the municipalities as urban areas, urban population has reached more than sixty percent of Nepal’s total population. But the urban areas still have rural characteristics and insufficient infrastructures. Due to the increasing urbanization, the maintenance of sufficient open spaces, greeneries and the preservation of agricultural lands has become important urban issues in Nepal. The loss of productive lands has resulted in decrease of food self-sufficiency and green spaces in the cities. To tackle this urban issue, the Fourteenth National Development Plan has emphasized the concept of Food Green City (FGC) by integrating urban agriculture into urban planning. This paper aims to elaborate the concept of FGC and explore necessary policy intervention to realize the concept of FGC in practice based on the study of Godawari Municipality of Nepal.

It may include the use of threat or force. In some cases, the person cannot give consent to sex because he/she is unconscious or otherwise incapacitated. A person may be raped by a stranger, an acquaintance or date or a family member.Methods: The study was a retrospective and descriptive analysis of cases of sexual assault victims examined by the author in the Forensic Medicine departments at Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj and Gandaki Medical College Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal over a period of four years (2012 to 2016). This includes information regarding the age group of the victim at the time of sexual abuse, relationship of the victim to the perpetrator, genital and extra-genital injuries present over the victim’s body and number of cases attended as an expert witness by the author in various courts of Nepal.Results: In the four years period, a total number of 55 cases were examined as sexual assault cases. It was observed that majority were of the 13 - 15 years of age group (46%) followed by <10 years (20%), 16 - 20 years (16%), >20 years (11%) and 10 - 12 years (7%).

Most of the officials are responsible for managing program and people rather than leading. Staff inspiration, motivation and encouragement, being one of the most important aspects of leadership, has been ignored in job description.

This chapter examines whether women and men manage household waste differently at the household level, especially at source segregation, managing recyclable waste (paper and plastic), and composting degradable waste. Using household survey data from the Bharatpur Metropolitan City of Nepal, we find that women are more likely to segregate waste at the source and also manage degradable waste at home better. Still, there is no gender difference in selling plastic and paper waste. In contrast, women are more likely to give paper or plastic waste either to the waste collectors (free) or throw away, suggesting a heterogeneity across gender when it comes to managing household waste. In most cases, women waste managers perform well (segregating at source and composting degradable waste), but they do not seem to do well in all areas of plastic or paper waste management where some sort of sensitization may be helpful.",,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Loans from international banks are needed to finance hydropower projects in Nepal as local banks do not have capacity to support large projects. However, most international banks have not yet been interested as many Nepalese projects are not yet considered “bankable” from a project finance perspective. There are many challenges to financing hydropower projects as the financing requires the project itself to be free of risk from a legal and contractual viewpoint, thus making it worthy of being used as collateral on its own right. The only way forward is for the government to change its policies significantly to ensure the bankability of projects currently being developed by many independent power producers.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/hn.v13i0.10033HYDRO NEPAL Journal of Water, Energy and EnvironmentIssue No. 13, July 2013Page: Uploaded date: 3/12/2014",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/10033/8181,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

This study revealed that there is a significant increase in natural vegetation in all parts of the watershed. However, there is the highest rate of increase in vegetation in lower plain areas, where the population density is the highest. The overall increase in natural vegetation is because of the decreasing human and livestock population, changes in lifestyle, etc. The highest increase in natural vegetation in lower plain areas is because of the alternative use of cooking energy and building materials in urban and accessible areas, decreasing the number of livestock.

The aim of study was to assess the number of dentists in the country and to explore their distribution according to demographic and professional characteristics.Methods: A census was performed during July 2015 to July 2016 about the Nepali dentists. The study assessed demographic and professional characteristics of dentists including age, gender, ethnicity, education attainment, university, country/year of graduation, and work place using data collection sheet by trained data collectors. For those not accessible for direct contact, the information was obtained through secondary data. Data entry was done in CSPro software application and was analyzed in SPSS 20. Results: The total number of registered Nepali dentists was 1803 with 419 specialists until June 2015. The male to female ratio was 1:1.46. Among all; 1318 (73%) were present in the country, 1047 (58%) were professionally active, and 1366 (76%) were below the age of 35 years. Among the professionals; 831 (79%) were employed in private sector and 601 (57%) worked in Kathmandu valley.Conclusions: The dentist-population ratio is decreasing exponentially in capital and major cities of Nepal however it remains very high in rural areas.

The mechanism of the LSL failure process is not well understood due to the different deformation stages controlled by geological structures and causative/ triggering factors. Regional tectonic structures and local rock mass characteristics play a vital role in the formation of LSLs. Engineering geological characterization was performed to evaluate the rock/soil properties, and the associated state of danger (cracks, seepage, etc.). The rock mass rating (RMR) and geological strength index (GSI) methods were used to estimate rock mass quality and strength parameters. The estimated strength parameters together with laboratory test data were used to set up a two-dimensional (2D) landslide surface to simulate the failure scenarios. The simulation of landslide models was iterated under different loading conditions by incorporating geological heterogeneities. The results have demonstrated that the movement of the slope was affected by different stress conditions over time, which were verified using spatiotemporal landslide data. The landslide exhibited a three-stage failure mechanism with the development of tension-induced cracking at the rear and shearing failure of the critical locking section in the middle section. The tension shear and joint-step-path rupture along joint surfaces occurred during different stages of the landslide failure processes. The simulated results showed that the genetic development of LSL is mainly attributed to the geological structures and sudden changes in stress conditions. Thus, the research outcomes can be illustrative to evaluate the role of geological discontinuities, geotechnical parameters and triggering effects by the numerical simulation techniques for the failure mechanism of LSLs.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57921/43297,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Despite development in the level of health education expertise in human resources and institutional obstetric care in our country, the delay in early recognition of the problem, transportation to proper health facility and getting proper expert care are major hurdles to reduce complications. Therefore we decided to study feto-maternal outcomes in our setting.Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional hospital based study carried out in Nobel Medical College, Biratnagar, from 17th June 2014 to 16th June 2015. Details and data obtained from Medical Record Section were analysed. All patients with eclampsia were included and fetomaternal outcomes measured in terms of complications. Simple descriptive statistical method was applied for analysis.Results: Among 8,066 deliveries, 112 had eclampsia with incidence of 13.8/1000 deliveries. Majority (41%) were of <19 years of age. Above 90% were unbooked. Aoubt 63.4% were primiparas and 83% had antepartum eclampsia. Eclamptic fits were more common (41.6%) in 37-40 weeks period of gestation. Fits to delivery interval was more than six hours in 89.1% women and 69.3% women underwent caesarean delivery. About 18.9% women developed eclampsia related complications. Common causes of maternal deaths (5.36%) were pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, cerebrovascular accidents and HELLP syndrome. Perinatal death was nine percent.Conclusions: Although the obstetric care facilities are improving with time, the feto-maternal outcomes are still poor in our country.

The analysis methods has been used the Auto Regression Model and Granger-Causality Tests for achieved the results. The result of the study reveals that there is a significant relationship between the export and economic growth of Nepal. The result showed when export increases by 1 unit then GDP increases by 0.58 units in short run. It indicates that current GDP growth is also affected by past year’s export. Similarly, Granger causality test also shows that export trade caucused to economic growth (p=0.0071) and foreign loan also caucused to economic growth (p=0.0410). It shows that there is a unidirectional causality with economic growth in Nepal. Hence, this study suggests that the policy makers should focus on exportable products which have potential for larger scale productions within the country, and comparative advantage for export trade as well as economic growth in Nepal.

The analysis is restricted to the currently pregnant women at the time of survey. Logistic regression was used to assess the net effect of several independent variables on unintended pregnancy. The factors leading to unintended pregnancy were also predicted by using some significant variables in the model. Results: More than two-fifth of the respondents (41%) reported that their current pregnancies were unintended. The results indicate that age, age at first marriage, religion, exposure to radio and knowledge of family planning (FP) methods were key predictors of unintended pregnancy. Experience of unintended pregnancy augments along with the women’s age. Similarly, increase in age at first marriage reduces the likelihood of unintended pregnancy among women. Those who were exposed to radio were less likely (odds ratio, 0.65) to have unintended pregnancy compared to those who were not. Those women who had higher level of knowledge about FP methods were 40% less likely to experience unintended pregnancy compared to those having lower level of knowledge. Conclusion: One of the important factor contributing to high level of maternal and infant mortality is unintended pregnancy. Programs should intend to reduce unintended pregnancy by focusing on all these identified issues so that infant and maternal morbidity and mortality as well as abortion will be decreased and the overall health of the family could be improved.

The objectives of the study were determining the better variety nitrogen management practices for spring rice cultivation. The study was conducted in Factorial Randomized Complete Block Design replicated thrice. Factor A includes spring rice varieties viz. Chaite-5 and Hardinath-3. Factor B includes the nitrogen management practices adopted which were: Recommended dose of N at 3 equal splits, 1/3 at basal +1/3 at 20 DAT + 1/3 at 45 DAT; Recommended dose of N at 3 splits, ¼ at basal + ½ at 20 DAT + ¼ at 45 DAT; N application using leaf color chart (LCC); Zero N, Control and Farmer’s Fertilizer Practices (FFP). Rice seedlings were raised in a wet nursery bed and transplanted in experimental plots on 21st March 2020. The crop geometry was 20 x 20 cm. Growth parameters, grain yield, and yield-attributing traits of rice were recorded. The results revealed statistical differences between the treatments in terms of agronomical parameters, yield attributing characters, and grain yield. Results indicate the recommended dose of N application at 3 splits i.e., ¼ at basal+ ½ at 20DAT+ ¼ at 45 DAT contributes to the higher plant height (104.79 cm), the number of tillers (9.88), grain yield (4.9 Mt ha-1) and straw yield (7.44 Mt ha-1). The highest LAI (2.84), flag leaf length (31.063 cm), and effective tillers/m2 (245.41) were obtained in nitrogen application using LCC. Moreover, the recommended dose of N at 3 splits, ¼ at basal + ½ at 20 DAT + ¼ at 45 DAT, and nitrogen application using LCC showed almost similar performance in most of the parameters. Among the varieties, Hardinath 3 produced the highest plant height (100.86 cm), Flag leaf length (29.509 cm), and 1000 grain weight (29.059 gm) as compared to Chaite 5 (94.613 cm), (26.355 cm) and (24.199 g) respectively. Also, there was a positive correlation between the grain yield and effective tillers per m2 (r =0.972), grain yield and filled grains per panicle (r =0.405), and grain yield and LAI (r =0.716).

The hydro-geochemical assessment of the groundwater is the basic part of the water resources management and its assessment in regards to its usability is considered vital. The study involves the measurement of physicochemical parameters (pH, EC, EH, DO, TDS) of the observed 147 springs and the ionic concentration of the representative 32 springs along the Mai Khola Watershed using standard analytical procedure. The results of the physicochemical parameters and ionic concentration were analysed and interpreted using different indices and graphical methods. The physicochemical parameter suggests that spring water is weakly acidic to alkaline and the measured EC and TDS suggest low interaction of rocks and water therein. The piper diagram indicates Ca2+ and Mg2+ together (alkaline earth metals) dominate over combined Na+ and K+ (alkali metals) and Cl- and SO42- (strong acids) predominate over HCO3- (weak ones). The Gibbs plot also satisfies the movement of groundwater from the precipitation domain to the rock-water interaction domain. The groundwater in this area is derived from a shallow aquifer with low rock-water interaction and the water is good for drinking purpose and excellent to good for irrigation.

The current study is an attempt to explore potential risk with respect to physical infrastructure and assess modeled and actual physical damage and human loss caused by different earthquake scenario and actual 2015 earthquake event in Thecho of Kathmandu valley. The earthquake scenario is based on two nearest fault lines. Risk Assessment Tools for the Diagnosis of Urban Seismic Risk (RADIUS) method has been applied for estimation of potential building damage and casualties..The research has adopted integrated approach using secondary and primary data sources such as field observation, key informant survey and building survey through purposive random sampling.The study found that potential building damage estimated by RADIUS for Gorkha 2015 earthquake scenario and North-west (Khokana) are lower than the actual post-earthquake assessment whereas North earthquake scenario resulted higher loss. Actual damage caused by 2015 earthquake compared to modeled damage from RADIUS is found higher because additional damaged were made by successive aftershocks. Spatial distribution of potential building damage for earthquake scenarios and actual 2015 earthquake event is also variable. North-Nuwakot Earthquake Scenario resulted more hazardous than the North-Khokana scenario though the location of epicenter is relatively farther with high intensity. The study concluded that though earthquake occurrence and disaster is still less predictable risk assessment tools like RADIUS and mitigation measures based on such is important for reducing risk of earthquake disaster.The Geographical Journal of NepalVol. 11: 127-136, 2018",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/19553/16011,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

The Indo-Gangetic Plain consists of coarse sand, gravel, pebble, cobble and boulders in the northern part (Bhabar zone) that becomes finer (up to gravel size) southwards. Because of porous geology, the Bhabar zone is the potential area for groundwater recharge, but there is a restricted water availability due to deeper water table. A detailed investigation of has been carried out in parts of Chulachuli Village Development Committee of Ilam district, Nepal to assess the hydrogeological condition. The secondary information and primary data collected in the field and interpretation of satellite imageries had been carried out to extract relevant information and update the geological map of the area.

Using the time series data of 48 years of the study period from 1975 to 2022, Engle-Granger’s co-integration and error correction models are used to examine the fiscal effects on the trade deficit, and the ARDL model is used to examine the effects on current account deficit. The basic variables used in the analysis are government expenditure to GDP ratio, budget deficit to GDP ratio, trade deficit to GDP ratio, broad money supply to GDP ratio, trade openness, real exchange rate, and real per-capita Indian GDP. Data are taken from the Ministry of Finance, Nepal Rastra Bank, and World Development Indicators. The findings show that the government expenditure to GDP ratio and trade openness positively affect the trade deficit as domestic factors, while real per-capita Indian GDP positively affects the trade deficit as an external factor. Also, the budget deficit to GDP ratio has a positive effect, while the broad money supply to GDP ratio has a negative effect on the current account deficit as domestic factors. The real exchange rate is negatively and real Indian per-capita GDP are positively driving the Nepal’s current account deficit as external factors. This study identifies the real exchange rate with Indian rupees, Indian real per-capita GDP, and financial development as novel explanatory variables of current account deficit and therefore provides additional evidence on external deficit in the context of Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/68023/52145,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

It has a high prevalence in the population and is associated with high morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Here, we aimed to study the socio-demographic profiles, etiologies of CKD and associated co-morbidities in patients attending a referral hospital. Methods: We conducted a hospital based, descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study among adult patients with CKD attending Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH), Kathmandu. Patients younger than 16 years and renal allograft recipients were excluded from the study. A diagnosis of CKD was established by the treating nephrologist based on KDIGO 2012 clinical practice guideline. Prior informed consent was taken. Data was collected on clinical features, socio-demographic profiles, major co-morbidities, presumed etiology of CKD and hematological and biochemical parameters of the patients. SPSS version 24 (Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the analysis of data. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Institute of Medicine (IOM). Results: A total of 401 patients with CKD were included in the study. The mean age of the patient was 50.92 years (SD=17.98), male to female ratio was 1.8:1. Among these patients, 86% were Hindu, 24.4% were farmers, 57% were from the Hilly region of Nepal, 51% were active smokers, and 51.6% were alcohol consumers. Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) (36.2%; n= 145), diabetes mellitus (31.9%; n= 128) and hypertension (21.7%; n=87) were the three most common identified causes of CKD. Among the biopsy proven CGN patients, IgA nephropathy was the most common cause. In a large proportion of patients (68.3%) cause of CGN was not known. Most of the patients were in CKD stage 5 (27%), and stage 5D (55.8%). Coronary artery disease (CAD) (in 7% patients), heart failure (in 2.7%) and stroke (in 2.2%) were the most common comorbidities. Anemia was prevalent in CKD from stage 3 onwards, the severity increased with increasing stage (p <0.001). Hemodialysis was the predominant mode of renal replacement therapy (RRT) used by 98.2% of CKD 5D patients. Conclusion: Nepalese patients of CKD are younger; males are more affected than females. CGN, diabetes and hypertension are three most common causes of CKD; IgA nephropathy is the most common cause of biopsy proven CGN leading to CKD. Anemia is common from CKD stage 3 onwards. The most common associated co-morbidity is CAD.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/879/788,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Improper visualization of primary fistulous tract and the associated abscesses or secondary tracts a r e the causes of recurrence. Earlier imaging modalities like conventional fistulography, endosonography and CT scan have had limited role. Even without endorectal coils, 3T MRI has multi-planar imaging capability and excellent soft tissue differentiation to show perianal anatomy, primary and secondary tracts with associated abscesses in relation to sphincter complex. It provides excellent road map to surgeons for preoperative evaluation. The objective of the study was to evaluate the role of 3T MR in imaging of perianal fistulas. Methods: A retrospective study was done among 32 patients who were referred for MR fistulogram for suspected perianal fistula at Jeebanta Advanced Kathmandu Imaging, Durbar Marg, Kathmandu, Nepal. All images and findings were obtained and recorded with the help of Philips Ingenia 3T digital broadband MR scanner. Imaging was performed in oblique coronal and oblique axial plane. MR images were studied and grading system was applied according to the St James’s University Hospital Classification. The data were entered in a performa and was analyzed using IBM SPSS V21. Results: Male to female ratio was 7:1. According to St. James University Hospital MR Imaging classification of perianal fistulas, most of the patients (25%) had Grade 4 followed by (12.5% each) Grade 0, Grade 1 and Grade 2 and (6.3% each) Grade 3 and Grade 5 fistulas. Mean age was 37.28 years (Std. deviation 11.9). Common internal opening in axial image was found at 5 0’ clock positions (31.3%). Mean length of the fistulous tract was 3.9 cm (Std. deviation 2.3). Conclusion: Perianal fistulas are more common in males and Grade 4 fistulas are the commonest. MRI is well-tolerated, painless and non-invasive technique and has multiplanar capabilities with excellent tissue differentiation of pelvic muscle along with sphincter complex.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JSSN/article/download/24552/20658,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger

This is the first issue of volume 25 of JSSN. I take this opportunity to thank all the stakeholders of the JSSN and especially the founder of the JSSN.   A journal is a tool for publishing research and it is important to ensure that the research can be used by the community. They are important tools to disseminate scientific knowledge, improve the quality of research, identify new trends and provide a platform for published authors to showcase their work. Realizing this and with limited resources and experience in publishing, back in 1998 Prof. K. D. Joshi and his team published the first issue of the Journal of Society of Surgeons of Nepal. Because of their initiation, dedication and hard work, today we are here with this 25th volume to you.   The journal is an essential part of the scientific community, and it is essential for the advancement of knowledge. It is an important step in getting published, but publishing a journal is challenging especially in developing countries. Developing countries face unique challenges as compared to developed ones. The challenges of publishing in developing countries include lack of funds and limited resources, low quality of submissions, lack of qualified reviewers and editors, lack of publishers' support, low standards of proofreading etc. Scientific journals have become expensive to produce and there is little or no financial support available for their production. The costs include printing, distribution costs, website hosting and maintenance costs. While the whole of the editorial team are volunteers and some even have to spend out of their pocket for the journal. That’s the reason why there are not enough qualified volunteers for the editorial job in the journal. Most of the burden of work is on one or two persons. The most significant challenge is to get the right kind of peer review as peer review is also a volunteer task. Many authors who send the articles to the journal want early publication. But they don't have time to review articles for the same journal.   We while publishing JSSN face similar challenges. We are thankful to those who spent and are spending time and money on this novel task. This includes all past chief editors, editors, peer reviewers and technical staff.   Despite the challenges, JSSN is moving on to maintain national and international standards. We developed our online platform for article submission, processing and publication in 2014. Now all the new issues after that and most of the previous issues are available online. We received two stars (out of three) in the journal publishing practices and standards (JPPS) framework (https://www.journalquality.info)  in 2020 AD and working on getting three stars. We were able to get indexed in a reputed and prominent Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ, doag.org) in 2021.   Meeting the international standards and getting an index on a different platform is difficult because of a lack of funds and dedicated manpower for the journal. It also requires specific stringent criteria which need subscriptions to service and payment per article or yearly basis which is a burden for publishing societies. Publishing societies should support the journal to go ahead and be of international standard with additional cost if required.   The scientific community needs access to quality peer-reviewed journals that are accessible to researchers from developing countries. To reach this goal, we must invest more resources into supporting the journals and ensuring that they are sustainable. Journal is the face of a professional society like ours and is also one of the most important activities of society.  We are thankful to the Society of Surgeons of Nepal for the support which we have received till now. We hope JSSN will get more support and encouragement in future for the improvement of the quality of the journal and meeting ever-increasing international criteria of journal standards.

Previously, inflammatory arthritis used to be treated only when there was a clear evidence of damage or deformity occurring with it. Use of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were considered potentially harmful early in the course of arthritis which could be self-limiting. However, with the abundance of data on outcomes of early arthritis and identification of factors that can help to predict those outcomes lead to earlier use of such DMARDs. Better understanding of serological tests like anti-CCP antibodies and imaging modalities like high frequency ultrasound with power doppler and magnetic resonance imaging has increased the diagnostic and prognostic yield of such early arthritis cases. It is now imperative that the risk be assessed early in the course of disease and early DMARDs be instituted for better outcome in these cases.This review analyses the historical evolution of evidence in the management of early undifferentiated arthritis and summarises the treatment approach, monitoring and disease outcomes till date.",http://www.jnma.com.np/jnma/index.php/jnma/article/download/3893/2819,,SDG 2: Zero Hunger
