Hence, 31 samples were taken from the drinking water distribution system of Dharan in the spring of 2022 for evaluating the physicochemical and microbiological quality of drinking water being distributed across the sub-metropolitan city. Though public knowledge and adequate management of watershed and reservoir premises were insufficient, the physicochemical characteristics were determined to be within the National Drinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS) for drinking water with temperatures ranging from 23.6 °C to 25.6 °C, pH 7.7 to 8.5, conductivity 38.2 to 38.7 µS/cm, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) 7.7 to 9.0 mg/L, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) 0.8 to 1.8 mg/L, chloride 29.82 to 34.08 mg/L, nitrite 10 mg/L and ammonia <0.5 mg/L. However, the coliform bacteria levels were significant, with the highest TCC (Total Coliform Count) being 137 CFU/100mL, the highest FCC (Fecal Coliform Count) being 85 CFU/100mL and the highest TPC (Total Plate Count) being TMTC (Too Many To Count). The water was found to be unsafe to drink without disinfection treatments.

In context of oral health promotion, fluoride when consumed in recommended level decreases the solubility of enamel to acidic exposure and improves the strength of dental enamel that eventually helps reduce dental caries.So, this study was conducted to estimate the fluoride concentration in drinking water of eastern development region Nepal.Methods: Water samples (165) were randomly collected from drinking water sources of Eastern Development Region, Nepal. Three categories of water samples (municipal, natural, packaged bottle water) each from three most populated cities of every district in the region were collected. The water samples were collected in autoclaved polypropylene plastic vessels. American Public Health Association 4500 F- D method was used for fluoride estimation.Results: Majority of the water samples (88.2%) had fluoride concentration below the optimum as per WHO guideline. Median fluoride concentration of municipal water supply, natural water resources and packaged bottle water was 0.09 ppm (<0.05 to 1.11 ppm), 0.13 ppm (<0.05 to 1.80 ppm) and 0.05ppm (<0.05 ppm to 0.78 ppm) respectively. Median fluoride concentration of Himalayan region, hill region and terai region was 0.17 ppm, 0.10 ppm and 0.07 ppm respectively. Overall median fluoride concentration of eastern development region Nepal was 0.08 ppm (<0.05 pmm to 1.80 ppm).

Majority of the developing countries face serious problems in proper technology and management strategy to regulate drinking water quality, though there are numerous cases of adverse health impacts. Population growth, unsystematic urbanization and improper management of the resources are some of the pressing factors. In Nepal, about 80% of prevalent communicable diseases are due to poor sanitation and lack of access to quality water. The coverage and functionality of the water supply system is still crucial owing to the degraded quality of water. In fact, there is no data available on water quality. Despite huge investment in implementing Water Safety Plan (WSP) approach in developing regions, many countries still lack the baseline water quality data (information flow) in the water supply system. Nepal is one of the countries where WSP is implemented for a long time (more than a decade) but the regular drinking water monitoring mechanism is still a matter of question. Studies have mentioned Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) practices in schools and possibilities of involving schools in WSP programs as well but the systematic method and model to integrate Youth/ Students and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in Drinking Water Quality Monitoring is yet unexplored. In addition, the data accuracy of Citizen Based Monitoring needs to be checked. Therefore, the first phase of this research has developed a suitable design of Youth-led Participatory Sensing (YPS) to improve water supply management facility, including the strategy to support Climate Resilient Water Safety Plan (CR-WSP) framework of the local water utilities and, this paper highlights on performance evaluation and accuracy of data acquired from YPS Model with paired experimental approach, and gamified techniques in designing the participation from training to field implementation, including the community awareness targets for the selected water supply schemes of Pokhara Metropolitan City (PMC), Nepal, which can be validated and replicated in similar urban or peri-urban settings of national, regional and the global context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youth-led Participatory Sensing (YPS), Drinking Water Security, Water Quality, ICTs, Water Supply Schemes, CR-WSPs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS71uqFnjF0&amp;t=66s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A video link about a part of the on-going doctoral research work in Nepal&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;",,,SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation

This article focuses on the issues of planning and designing water distribution systems of large irrigation systems at the irrigation service delivery level. The layout planning of an irrigation system is an important aspect of design for water distribution, typically guided by hierarchical system. This article also highlights the existing canal hierarchy of these systems and their appropriateness for efficient water distribution. Furthermore, the appropriateness of the structured system is also examined in the Sunsari Morang Irrigation Project.

I argue that drinking water supply projects that are conducted using an individualized community-led methodology by international and local NGOs working in partnership are more effective and sustainable than generalized methodologies often employed by the government, and positively contribute to other areas of development including gender equality. To do this, I look specifically at the approaches taken by the NGOs Nepal Water for Health (NEWAH) and Engineers Without Borders (EWB) in providing drinking water supply systems to rural communities in Nepal.

The mid-hill region of Nepal is also experiencing serious water shortages in recent years. In order to assess the availability of drinking water in the mid-hill regions of Nepal, we studied hydrogeology, land use types and collected water samples from 30 springs in Kavre, Kahmandu Valley, Nuwakot and Tanahu in Nepal between July 17-September 12, 2017. For each sampling spring, while surrounding land use type (mixed, agriculture, urban, vegetation) and spring type (fracture, depression, contact) were determined through field observation, the field pH, conductivity and temperature was determined using relevant probes and thermometers. Water samples were collected in 1L and 165mL plastic bottles for chemical and total coliform determination, respectively, in the lab. Bottles were rinsed twice using spring water before filling them with sample water, then stored in an ice chest, and brought to the lab. In the laboratory, turbidity, conductivity, Ca, Mg, HCO3, SO4, Na, NO3, Cl, Fe, As, and total coliform were determined using standard methods. Spring water in agricultural areas showed significantly higher suspended solids compared to other land use types whereas spring water in urban areas showed significantly higher dissolved substances. By spring type, turbidity and conductivity values and the concentration of dissolved constituents (Ca, Mg, HCO3, SO4, NO3, and Cl) were ranked in the order of fracture < contact < depression. Na and Fe concentration were in the order of fracture = contact < depression. By land-use type, conductivity and dissolved constituents (Ca, Mg, HCO3) were in the order of agriculture < vegetation < mixed < urban. Whereas urban land use had the highest values for SO4, Na, NO3, and Cl, other land use types showed variable order. Fe concentration was ranked in the order of urban < mixed < vegetation < agriculture. Total coliform was in the order of mixed < agriculture < urban < vegetation. These results indicate that land use type and surface condition, which is possibly associated with human activities, heavily affect spring water properties in the region. These results suggest that drinking water security of mid-hill region of Nepal is threatened heavily due to poor spring water quality. Protection of drinking water sources should be specific to land use type and activities around the springs.

The study was carried out with an aim to assess the quality of ground water in particular sites of the Kathmandu valley. The ground water samples were collected from shallow well, tube well and deep tube wells located at specific places of the valley. The research was focused on physiochemical and bacteriological analysis of underground water from sites near to Bagmati river (≤20 meters) and from sites far from Bagmati river (>50 meters). The sampling sites were scattered from Sinamangal to Minbhavan. Total sample size was 100, with 50 in each stratum. Study processing was done during the period from February 2013 to May 2013. Six physiochemical parameters namely pH, Conductivity, Ammonia level, Chloride level, Nitrite level, Nitrate level and Biological parameters (Coliform and Fecal coliform) of each sample was tested. Based on the research work, it was recorded that the underground water close to river (≤20 meters) has comparatively high physiochemical and biological parameter (Fecal Coliform) than underground water that were farther from the river (>50 meters). Fecal Coliform was predominant 58% (29/50) in water nearer to river rather than in water farther from the river 20% i.e. (10/50).  Similarly, the values of physiochemical and biological parameter increased comparatively with more distance i.e. ≤10 meters from river.

The study aimed to assess the level of fluoride in drinking water sources in the Sudurpashchim Province of Nepal.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to July 2023 with water samples from natural, municipal, and packaged sources collected in polypropylene plastic bottles from all 9 districts of the province. Three samples from each district's two most populous municipalities (one urban and one rural municipality) were taken. Water samples from the only sub-metropolitan city in the province (Dhangadhi) were also included. Fifty-seven samples were sent to a Nepal Standard-certified lab in Kathmandu for fluoride estimation using the American Public Health Association-approved method. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel and analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences v 22. A p-value less than 0.05 was taken as significant. Results: Most of the water samples had fluoride levels below 0.1 ppm. The highest fluoride concentration was seen in a sample from a hand pump in the rural municipality of Kanchanpur (0.9 ppm). No significant differences were observed between water samples according to different water sources, geographical regions, or categories of water resources.Conclusions: Fluoride concentration in water sources of Sudurpashchim is well below the recommended level for caries protection.

This study examines the impact of natural disaster on household access to drinking water taking a case of Nepal’s 2015 Earthquake. Drawing on data from four rounds of the Annual Household Survey (AHS) spanning from 2013/14 to 2016/17, the study employs a difference-in-difference research design to examine how households were impacted in accessing drinking water in the earthquake affected districts of Nepal. The results reveal that households in earthquake affected regions experience a decline in the use of piped drinking water by six-percentage-points compared to other sources of water notably wells, spring and rivers. Concurrently, there was a corresponding increase in the use of open water sources, particularly rivers and springs, for drinking among these households. These findings underscore that during disaster, sources like rivers and spring water can serve as essential alternatives for households, especially in the Hill and Mountain regions of Nepal, where other drinking water alternatives are less feasible. However, it is an important to note that these open water sources are often deemed unsafe for consumption and carry potential health risks. In light of these insights, this study emphasizes the necessity for disaster preparedness plans to prioritize establishing mechanisms that guarantee the safety of such open water sources for drinking during natural disaster and extreme events in the future.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/58535/43803,,SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation

Therefore, a vulnerable ranking method was adopted to distinguish the priorities to reconstruct damaged and totally destroyed water schemes in Dhading, Gorkha, Nuwakot, and Rasuwa districts of Nepal, which are the districts in the most earthquake affected region. In the process of vulnerability ranking, three major community level parameters and indicators were considered for the ranking. 1) Number of households without safe drinking water after an earthquake, 2) Number of households without improved sanitation after an earthquake, and 3) Disadvantage Group (DAG) ranking of the Village Development Committees (VDCs) of the districts.

The overall purpose of this study was to analyse the suitability of drinking water by studying the physicochemical properties. Springs of Deumai watershed Ilam, Nepal was investigated for water samples and the physicochemical parameters studied were TDS, pH, temperature, total hardness, alkalinity, total iron and major ion concentrations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl–, SO42–, NO­3–) to describe the water’s chemical characteristics. The physical parameters were determined using pH meter, laboratory thermometer etc. The determination of concentration of chemical parameters was performed by using spectrophotometric method, flame photometric method and titration method. The average pH was found 7.47 and average temperature was found to be 19.4ºC. The dominance trend for major cations was Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ > Fe and for anions was HCO3– > Cl– > NO3– > SO42–. All the values obtain were within the range specified by WHO and NDWQS guidelines of drinking water.

Nepal gets a meager 160,000 acres irrigation facility (1.3 percent of total irrigation benefits) from these unequivocal biased agreements. The adverse social and ecological impacts in Nepal are unaccounted for.Such water resource agreements have resulted in the sad present-day plight of Nepal: social life and industries are in total disarray with dismally low economic growth rates (GDP) forcing millions of Nepalese to seek employment abroad.Before it gets out of hand, India’s direct/indirect domination over Nepal’s water resources and politics should end, so that Nepal can develop its economy and hydropower in peace.Nepal should first develop run-of-river projects as per the modality of 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project (cost 1000 US$/kWh) and medium size storage hydropower projects (140 MW Tanahu).

Methods: Treated water samples were collected from all over the Kathmandu valley and analyzed in terms of physicochemical and microbiological parameters over the period of one year from July 2017 to July 2018. The physio-chemical parameters of water samples were performed according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater. The total coliforms were enumerated by standard membrane filtration technique. Results: We report that microbiological aspect of treated water was the major problem as 66% of the water samples crossed the guideline value for total coliform count. Above 92% of jar water samples, 77% of tanker water samples and 69% of filtered water samples had the total coliform count exceeding the NDWQS. Moreover, 20% of bottled water was contaminated by coliform bacteria.

According to the World Health Organization, diarrheal diseases can be substantially prevented through safe drinking water sources. In the Kathmandu Valley, because of the shortage of piped water, local residents use alternative water sources, such as groundwater, jars and tanker water. However, these alternative water sources can be contaminated. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between diarrhoea risk and the combinations of drinking water sources. A survey using multiple questionnaires on diarrhoea occurrence, water sources and water treatment was conducted three time between 2015 and 2016. The odds ratios (ORs) of developing diarrhoea were significantly high for drinking jar (OR 6.1) and tanker water (OR 8.4) compared with not drinking. The combined drinking of jar and tanker water obtained the 1 log higher OR compared with drinking only piped water. Conversely, drinking groundwater had a low OR, implying that the residents refrained from drinking polluted groundwater. In conclusion, diarrhoea occurrence was related not only to the level of water contamination, but also to a behavioural factor, i.e. people's careful management of the choice of multiple water sources.",https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article-pdf/14/2/195/42686074/ihab032.pdf,,SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
