Home to eight of the world's ten highest peaks, including Mount Everest, it is an ecologically diverse country with three main physiographic regions: the mountains, the highly populated hill region, and the tropical Terai. This terrain includes over 118 different types of ecosystems (MFSC, 2002: 10). The bounty afforded by the biological diversity of the hill and Terai in particular have sustained their inhabitants for millennia, although landscapes in both have been seriously degraded, while in today's Nepal the natural wonders of the mountains and to a lesser extent the Terai attract trekkers and other tourists from around the world.",,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Here, we report on evidence that interfacing two metal thin films can suppress spin transmission and absorption. We examine spin pumping in spin-source/spacer/spin-sink heterostructures, where the spacer consists of metallic Cu and Cr thin films. The Cu/Cr spacer largely suppresses spin pumping—i.e., neither transmitting nor absorbing a significant amount of spin current—even though Cu or Cr alone transmits a sizable spin current. The antiferromagnetism of Cr is not essential for the suppression of spin pumping, as we observe similar suppression with Cu/V spacers with V as a nonmagnetic analog of Cr. We speculate that diverse combinations of spin-transparent metals may form interfaces that suppress spin pumping, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear.

In context of oral health promotion, fluoride when consumed in recommended level decreases the solubility of enamel to acidic exposure and improves the strength of dental enamel that eventually helps reduce dental caries.So, this study was conducted to estimate the fluoride concentration in drinking water of eastern development region Nepal.Methods: Water samples (165) were randomly collected from drinking water sources of Eastern Development Region, Nepal. Three categories of water samples (municipal, natural, packaged bottle water) each from three most populated cities of every district in the region were collected. The water samples were collected in autoclaved polypropylene plastic vessels. American Public Health Association 4500 F- D method was used for fluoride estimation.Results: Majority of the water samples (88.2%) had fluoride concentration below the optimum as per WHO guideline. Median fluoride concentration of municipal water supply, natural water resources and packaged bottle water was 0.09 ppm (<0.05 to 1.11 ppm), 0.13 ppm (<0.05 to 1.80 ppm) and 0.05ppm (<0.05 ppm to 0.78 ppm) respectively.

The experiences gathered from Irrigation Sector Projects implemented under various donor agencies such as the World Bank (WB), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and UN/ILO have shown that successful irrigation projects must be defined and planned according to specific ecological regions and pertinent to the local environment. An integrated development approach considers the land use, roads, market, and other economic activities as they relate to prospects for poverty alleviation. Land evaluation and subsequent land use planning according to the soil, climate, land profile, and suitability of agriculture practices should be considered in the development works to ensure true benefit to the rural populations. The integrated approach as such will provide long term sustainability through environmentally sound practices. This approach has been widely applied in the European countries, Korea, Japan, and Sri Lanka.This paper primarily focuses on the irrigation and development approaches most suitable to Nepal’s three ecological regions. High mountain regions should be developed with pasture land, horticulture, organic vegetable farming, and tourism. Irrigation technology in these areas should be simple pipe conveyance, and tank irrigation. In the mid-hills horticulture on the sloping terrain and cereal crops in the river valleys with other diversified cropping systems should be applied. The Terai region is the ‘Bread Basket’ of Nepal, and has high potential for diversified agriculture and industrial development.For development in these regions to succeed, road networks and transportation facilities are essential to economic growth. Road transportation maximizes opportunity for tourism and other economic activities. Development work must be planned in an integrated approach, which should be based on appropriate land use patterns for environmentally sustainable practices. An ideal solution would be to envision the watershed as the unit for eco-friendly sustainable development planning involving all the stakeholders under the watershed purview. As an example, the principles of Integrated Water Resources Management Planning (IWRMP), and Integrated Watershed Management Plan (IWMP) have been successfully applied in the USA and Australia (Box 1). It has illustrated that vegetative covered catchment stores large amount of rain water, increases groundwater table, reduces erosion of soil, and lastly decreases the intensity of flood hazard. Whereas, the naked catchment areas are highly erodible, does not store rain water, susceptible to high erosion and landslides, and increases the flood intensity by three fold than a vegetative covered one. The vegetative cover increases the water resources availability for over all development for agriculture.                               HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 20Page: 31-40",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/16486/13409,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Hand dug wells were found to be more likely receptors of contamination than tube wells, as expected, with inter-well variations related to the relative redox conditions in the wells. Increased pit-emptying frequency was related to lower levels of nitrogen in the latrines and in the nearest wells, suggesting this may be an effective strategy for reducing the risks of groundwater contamination in such settings, all else being equal.",http://www.aimspress.com/article/10.3934/environsci.2018.3.143,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The project also aims to inform and educate communities in need to enable people to prosper across the world. The project is currently leading this groundwater security study in its five project countries, including Nepal. The main objective of this study is to identify key hydrogeological characteristics of Nepal and identify the existing gaps and challenge in groundwater security to ultimately provide WaterAid with related recommendations for future interventions. Qualitative methods were used for collection of data and primarily the OECD governance framework was used to undertake detailed analysis. Kavrepalanchowk, Dolakha, Kalikot and Bardiya were selected as the study sites with discussions carried out at local, provincial and federal level. Agencies working in the groundwater sector were consulted for information compilation and standards tools. There have only been a few comprehensive national level research projects on hydrogeology of Nepal. Thus, finding precise and up to date groundwater data is very limited. Based on available literature, it was found out that there are huge variations in the hydrogeological characteristics depending upon geographical locations in Nepal. Annual groundwater reserve in the mountain region is estimated to be at least 1,713 Million Cubic Metres (MCM) whereas in the Terai, annual recharge is between 8,800 MCM to 11,600 MCM. Main use of groundwater is for drinking, irrigation and sanitation purposes in the mountain areas, whereas in the Terai, on top of those usages, there is considerable use of groundwater for industrial purposes. Respondents from the Terai, hills and mountains have seen increased incidence of physical water scarcity compared to the situation in the past. In the hills and mountains, drying of springs and other water sources is the leading problem, whereas in the Terai, water quality and unsustainable use are the two biggest challenges. Biophysical contamination is high in both mountains and the Terai whereas water from the Terai plains have higher level of chemicals such as arsenic and ammonia, impacting both drinking water and crop production.There is also a gap in the institutional environment in the groundwater sector. Despite tremendous associations and linkages with groundwater resources, the Ministry of Water Supply lacks specific institutions and precise policies to deal with the resource. Within irrigation-related line ministries there is a unit/section on groundwater development, but its scope is only limited to expansion of irrigation command area with limited focus on the entire picture of the resource. The Ground Water Resource Development Board (GWRDB), with a mandate to undertake research and development, lacks resources and capacity to undertake long term research. There is a need to increase its capacity and make it more flexible in taking up new issues and challenges in the sector. There is a major gap in existing laws for sustainable use of groundwater resource contributing to both underutilisation and unsustainable extraction of the resource. Rapid governance analysis identified key gaps and challenge in the groundwater security sector of the country. In each of the OECD framework category, many pertinent gaps were identified: not having any specific institutions and policies on groundwater development; limited knowledge about groundwater; lack of capacity at all the three tiers of the government to understand and develop groundwater resources; lack of proper data management system; problems with local level water users groups in terms of their accountability. For each of the identified gaps, several actions have been suggested. Macro level recommendations include formulating groundwater policy, and amending key acts and policies.The study has recommended key possible actions for WaterAid, particularly with the aim of expanding work in collaboration with other line ministries. The devastating impacts of earthquakes on spring sources, rising threats due to climate change, unsustainable infrastructure development in hills and mountains, over-extraction of water in the Terai etc. all point to the same direction that water is increasingly become a scare resource. So, water policy, political economy of groundwater, pricing and distributing, water use conflicts, benefit sharing mechanism of groundwater resource will be very important in days to come. WaterAid should lead these vital themes on behalf of non-state actors. Most importantly, in order to ensure sustainable continuation of the current work, these new avenues will act as a pre-requisite. Hence, WaterAid, on top of continuing its current interventions, should have a long-term strategy to expand its portfolio to ensure long-term water security issues, which in essence could be the only way to attain its national and international goals.",,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Majority of the developing countries face serious problems in proper technology and management strategy to regulate drinking water quality, though there are numerous cases of adverse health impacts. Population growth, unsystematic urbanization and improper management of the resources are some of the pressing factors. In Nepal, about 80% of prevalent communicable diseases are due to poor sanitation and lack of access to quality water. The coverage and functionality of the water supply system is still crucial owing to the degraded quality of water. In fact, there is no data available on water quality. Despite huge investment in implementing Water Safety Plan (WSP) approach in developing regions, many countries still lack the baseline water quality data (information flow) in the water supply system. Nepal is one of the countries where WSP is implemented for a long time (more than a decade) but the regular drinking water monitoring mechanism is still a matter of question. Studies have mentioned Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) practices in schools and possibilities of involving schools in WSP programs as well but the systematic method and model to integrate Youth/ Students and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in Drinking Water Quality Monitoring is yet unexplored. In addition, the data accuracy of Citizen Based Monitoring needs to be checked. Therefore, the first phase of this research has developed a suitable design of Youth-led Participatory Sensing (YPS) to improve water supply management facility, including the strategy to support Climate Resilient Water Safety Plan (CR-WSP) framework of the local water utilities and, this paper highlights on performance evaluation and accuracy of data acquired from YPS Model with paired experimental approach, and gamified techniques in designing the participation from training to field implementation, including the community awareness targets for the selected water supply schemes of Pokhara Metropolitan City (PMC), Nepal, which can be validated and replicated in similar urban or peri-urban settings of national, regional and the global context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youth-led Participatory Sensing (YPS), Drinking Water Security, Water Quality, ICTs, Water Supply Schemes, CR-WSPs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS71uqFnjF0&amp;t=66s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A video link about a part of the on-going doctoral research work in Nepal&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;",,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

However, there is a widespread view that young men and women are becoming more at ease in each other's company and beginning sexual experiences prior to marriage, putting them at risk of the consequences of unsafe sex. This research aims to evaluate the factors associated with premarital sexual behavior and its consequences among Nepalese college-going adolescents and youths. This cross-sectional web-based study included 415 Nepalese students over the age of 18 who were enrolled in a bachelor's degree program in a discipline other than health science. Data was collected from students online using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Pearson's chi-square (χ2) and logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between the independent and outcome variables. Most participants (61.7%) had dating experience and 21.2% had premarital sex. About three-fourths (76.1%) of participants had premarital sex before the age of 20 years and the ages of sexual debut ranged from 13 to 25 years. The major reasons for sexual debut were desire, curiosity, continuation of love relationship, and peer pressure. One-third of students (33.0%) reported having more than two sex partners, and 11.4% had intercourse with commercial sex workers. Among students who had premarital sex, 13.7% of participants or their sex partners, had to undergo abortions because of unintended pregnancies. Having an illiterate parent (AOR=11.0; 95% CI=2.01-60.87), high pocket money (AOR=4.2; 95% CI=1.1-16.2), increased dating culture (AOR=18.8; 95% CI=4.8-74.2), a close friend who has experienced premarital sex (AOR=5.2; 95% CI=2.21-12.21), and exposure to pornography (AOR=97.87; 95% CI= 9.5-10001.4) were predictors of premarital sex among Nepalese college students.

Addressing systemic issues and building the resilience of community-managed supplies, which serve millions of people in rural LMIC settings, will be critical to improve access to safe drinking water. The How Tough is WASH (HTIW) framework to assess resilience was applied to community-managed water supplies in Ethiopia and Nepal to assess the effectiveness of this framework in field conditions. The resilience of these water supplies was measured along six domains—the environment, infrastructure, management, institutional support, community governance and supply chains—that can affect how they respond to climate change effects. We found that the HTIW framework provided an objective measure of resilience and could be used to rank water supplies in order of priority for action. We also found that systemic issues could be identified. The tools and methods used in the framework were easy to deploy by field research teams. The water supplies studied in Ethiopia and Nepal had low to moderate resilience to climate change. Service management and institutional support were weak in both countries. The data from Ethiopia and Nepal suggests that many water supplies in rural and small-town communities are unlikely to be resilient to future climate change without increased investment and support.

Our results demonstrate that the average annual groundwater discharge is 2.43 m3/s. Seasonally, the average groundwater discharge is 2.73 m3/s during Summer and is 2.13 m3/s during winter. We observe that the maximum (6.9 m3/s) and minimum (0.036 m3/s) rates occurred in September-October and March-April, respectively. We also find that the average runoff fraction (i.e., runoff/ precipitation) varied from 0.34 to 0.72, and the ET component varied from 0.24 to 0.547 of the total precipitation within the SWAT model.

Re-aeration and stirring of the treated water did not oxidize soluble manganese, and this caused the poor removal rates for manganese. Bench-scale dual-media filters comprising anthracite on top of sand/ceramic layers with dosages of poly aluminum chloride and chlorine worked well by removing coagulated iron in the anthracite layer and then removing manganese in the sand/ceramic layers. A manganese-oxide-coated ceramic filter provided the highest manganese removal from 1.10 mg/L to <0.01 mg/L, followed by manganese-oxide-coated sand and quartz sand.

Furthermore, the results revealed that the water is safe for irrigation purposes based on EC, Na%, SAR, KR, MAR, CROSS, and Wilcox diagram. The results also specified that no severe degradation in water, however, the low DO, and high BOD and COD values than that of the standard value prescribed by Nepal Drinking Water Quality Standard, signify the anthropogenic signature in the river water. This study provides the baseline information about the WQI and suitability of irrigation water quality, and further in-depth studies are required at spatiotemporal levels to get in-depth insights about the ecological health of the river.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNCS/article/download/30494/24418,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Development of hydropower project in most economical way possible is the first prerequisite to get maximum benefit from harnessing water resources. The maximum benefit can be achieved only through optimal design of the project. Each project component must be designed considering the required level of factor of safety, performance standards of each component and economy. On this backdrop, this paper intends to optimize the location of cutoffs in headworks to get maximum benefits from use of it in terms of safety and economy.Improper placement of cutoff not only reduces the factor of safety against piping but also curtails the project benefits due to excessive seepage flow. Piping (internal erosion of soil particles under structure) is associated with high exit gradient. It threatens the structural stability and ultimately leads to failure of structure while as excessive seepage flow limits the availability of flow for power generation and reduces the project benefits. So, the optimal design of headworks is an attempt to identify the best location of cutoff to control seepage flow and reduce exit gradient. Five different cases representing different location of cutoff were analyzed and their roles in controlling seepage flow and reducing exit gradient was evaluated to optimize the cutoff location. 2D Finite Element Method (FEM) was used for the seepage analysis. The analysis showed that cutoffs are essential to control seepage flow when dam/weir is founded in pervious soil. However, the best location to place cutoff must be adroitly identified to reap maximum benefit from use of cutoff. The analysis reveals that the role of central cutoff in controlling seepage flow and reducing exit gradient is very limited. Likewise, the u/s cutoff has minimum effect in reducing exit gradient but the d/s cutoff seemed very effective in reducing exit gradient resulting increased factor of safety against piping. Hence, this paper concludes that the d/s end is the optimal location to place cutoff to improve safety and economy of the project. In addition, the use of both u/s and d/s cutoffs extend positive roles both in controlling seepage flow and reducing exit gradient. However, in author’s opinion the construction cost of two cutoffs must be compared with benefit added by use of two cutoffs over use of single d/s cutoff.  HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 21, July, 2017Page: 42-44Upload Date: July 18, 2017",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/17820/14466,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The growing environmental awareness and water supply restrictions have made rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS) a priority as well as a necessity in many countries. To improve urban water security, the practice of an RWHS is increasingly being adopted in the cities and towns of developing countries. This study aims at identifying the factors affecting the adoption of rainwater harvesting for household uses in the Kathmandu valley (KV) of Nepal. The results were drawn from a survey of 405 respondents who reside in the KV. To explain the determinants of adaptation, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used. Results show that independence for water access and system sophistication are significant for the adaptation of RWHS and relative advantage plays a moderating role that has partial mediation among dependent and independent variables with a significant relationship. Thus, variables like independence for water access, system sophistication, relative advantage and sustainable use should be highlighted for a sustainable supply of water. For this, we recommend effective policy interventions at the local and national level for the adoption of RWHS and its advantages in terms of safeguarding water in the long run at the present changing climate scenario.",https://iwaponline.com/wp/article-pdf/24/10/1676/1123857/024101676.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Through series of semi-structured interviews, formal and informal discussions with local people and key informant interviews, the study found that Matatirtha, a peri-urban village, has traditionally been a source of water for the domestic water demand in Kathmandu. However, the social and economic developments have induced a paradigm shift in urban water transfer from the area and promoted the economic benefits as a way of compensating the loss of local water resources. Moreover, the increasing opportunities of economic benefits through water in absence of regulatory mechanism have facilitated exploitation of resources.

This study aims to assess the current water supply service levels and water supply inequalities of WUSAs in terms of water consumption, supply hours, and customer satisfaction. Among the three types of water service providers, WUSAs offered the best performance in terms of their low non-revenue water (NRW) rates and production costs, high bill collection rates, and long supply hours. During the COVID-19 lockdown, water consumption increased, but bill payment notably decreased, possibly due to restricted movement and hesitation by customers to make payments. The multiple-year water consumption variations illustrated the uneven water consumption behavior of customers. Despite the variation in water supply hours, Lorenz curves, Gini coefficients (G), and water consumption analysis depicted low inequalities (G ≈ 0.20–0.28) and adequate water consumption among WUSAs even in 2019–2020. In the three WUSAs, more than 90%, 74%, and 38% of customers consumed water above the basic, medium, and high levels, respectively.

However, studies including detailed microbial analyses of this source of potable water are lacking. In this study, jar water samples were examined for the occurrence of Cryptosporidium, Giardia, fecal indicator bacteria, and total bacteria. Methods: Thirty different brands of jars were collected in September 2014. Escherichia coli and total coliforms were determined using a Colilert reagent. Ten of the 30 brands were selected to test for Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and total bacteria. Bacterial DNA extraction from water samples was performed using the Cica Geneus DNA Extraction Kit, followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting the 16S rRNA gene of bacterial DNA. Protozoan detection was accomplished by concentrating the samples using the electronegative membrane vortex method. followed by immunomagnetic separation and fluorescent staining. Results: E. coli was detected in 10% of the samples, with a maximum concentration of 2 most probable number (MPN)/100 ml., whereas total coliforms were detected in 97% of the samples, with a maximum and mean concentration of 7.3 x 102 and 3.8 x 10 MPN/100 ml., respectively. Total coliforms concentrations in 40% of the samples ranged from 10 to 10 MPN/100 ml. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were not detected in any of the tested samples. Concentrations of total bacteria in the samples ranged from 10 to 10 cells/100 ml. Conclusions: Ninety-seven percent of the jar water brands were unsuitable for drinking without proper treatment based on the guideline values of the National Drinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS) of Nepal. There is no guideline value for total bacteria in NDWQS however, high concentrations can be indicative of poor control on regrowth of bacteria and recontamination or inefficient water treatment methods.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/664/622,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Analysis of arsenic contaminated groundwater of 287 tube wells and nutrition level of the rural communities of Bagahi village, Rautahat district, Tarai region has been performed. Methods: Altogether 538 households have access to the tube wells’ water for consumption. Results: About 6% of the total tested tube wells are considered as risk tube wells, which have arsenic level above the Nepal Interim Standard 50 part per billion (ppb). Of the total risk population, about 9% have been identified as arsenicosis patients. About 80% risk populations have consumed inadequate nutrition in terms of calorie content. The risk of arsenic among the risk populations is high because they are in most cases under nutrition and consuming the contaminated water. Conclusion: This indicates that the rural communities of the Bagahi locality are facing alarming situation.

This paper is based on the survey across the country along with the field implementation and action research on different conservation approaches over the years and locations. Management of agricultural biodiversity is being initiated in Nepal through ex-situ, on-farm, in-situ and breeding strategies by National Agriculture Genetic Resources Center (National Genebank) from 2010. National Genebank has implemented on-farm conservation across the country. Different approaches are community seed bank, community field genebank, household seed bank, household field genebank, village level field genebank and school field genebank. In addition to these, landrace enhancement program and recognition of agro-biodiversity rich farmers have also contributed on conserving APGRs. Identification of agro-biodiversity rich farmers have been initiated in collaboration with different governmental and non-governmental organizations across the country. Strong network among these farmers is supposed to establish for effectively managing APGRs on-farm. Agro-biodiversity conserved by such farmers is called household genebank, which consist of seed storage (household seed bank) and household field genebank. There are more than 100 CSBs in the country and some of them are conserving local genetic resources. Eight community field genebanks have been functionalized for conserving recalcitrant seeds and vegetatively propagated crop species. Village level field genebank has been established by NGO in Makwanpur district to conserve banana and taro. In this approach, different households grow different landraces, maintaining maximum diversity within a village. In some areas, school field genebank has been established by growing local APGRs in school areas. This helps to conserve APGRs, educate the students, earn the income and make environment beautiful. Genebank also encourages farmers to reintroduce the landraces from the National Genebank. Accessioning these APGRs and training to farmers and farming communities are necessary to effectively and efficiently conserving and utilizing APGRs on-farm.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/janr/article/download/26012/21653,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The commonly accepted theories include that arsenic in ground water stems from reductive dissolution of As-rich Fe(III)hydr(oxides) including microbial degradation of sedimentary organic matter. On the contrary, the influence of clay minerals in the sediments as hosts for As was clearly underestimated, as geochemical analysis depicted that As was generally associated with specific elements such as Na, K, Al, and Li. Moreover, there was a very weak correlation or decoupling between As and Fe in the ground water in Nepal, and this fact points to consequences for water treatment. The so-called Kanchan filters, used for the removal of As, installed in the lowlands of Nepal often exhibited effluent As concentrations well above Nepal’s drinking water quality standard value (i.e., 50 μg/L). Ground water concentrations of Fe and As proved to be the most important geochemical factors regarding the performance of the filters. Moreover, the flow rate as well as the contact time to the rusty nails in the filter, intended to adsorb As on their surface, influenced the removal efficiency. The removal rate was severely influenced by the handling of the filters, too. This short communication provides an overview of the removal efficiency of 30 filters, their drawbacks, the influence of the aging material in the filters as well as measures of improvements to enhance the efficiency of the filters.

The widely accepted explanation refers to the reductive dissolution of Fe-bearing minerals releasing As-oxyanions from the soil minerals. However, this hypothesis is only to some extent applicable. Given that arsenic and iron in the groundwater are weakly correlated or decoupled and iron(III) (hydr)oxides are scarcely present, a substantial portion of As and Fe has to be retained in clay minerals. The low concentration of iron in groundwater can be explained by the origin of As and Fe in the rocks (leucogranites); in the High Himalayas, they are low in Fe but considerably enriched in Li, B, As, Se, Br, Sr, Mo, Cd, P, and U. This unique geochemical setting has a major impact on the performance of the Kanchan Arsenic Filters (KAFs) used to eliminate As from groundwater in Nepal. Lack of sufficient Fe in groundwater, combined with limited release of iron by corrosion of iron nails, call for an adapted version of these filters. The first results from 20 modified filters show a clear increase in As removal efficiency, achieved mainly by the replacement of old nails, an added upper sand layer over the nails, and elongation of the outlet tube to avoid wet–dry cycles and to keep the nail bed immersed. Proper instructions to the users on the operation and maintenance of filters, by replacing the reactive materials (iron nails) and the lower sand bed regularly, are imperative.",https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsestwater.2c00404,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The open chain is longer with higher number of actors compared to the close chain. This study observed that actors have intensive horizontal competition in the open chain to collect and purchase maximum quantity. Therefore, profit is disproportionately distributed to the actors in higher level of the supply chain. The profit is based on the price the actor receives, which is determined by their bargaining power. An actor's bargaining power is determined by the capital holding capacity, market information, risk appetite, networking and social ties. The study suggests that Government's interventions such as providing security to traders, access to finance, organizing auction and providing market information can help to increase the bargaining power of lower level actors.

However, rapid urban expansion and overpopulation have resulted not only in water shortage but ended up polluting the same water body based on which the settlements had grown, a classic example can be taken as that of Kathmandu and other surrounding cities in Kathmandu Valley. Due to resource availability and centralized government system, many people have migrated to the Kathmandu in recent decades. The annual population growth rate in the valley is 4.63% (CBS 2011) which has created haphazard urbanization resulting in water supply challenges. Geologically, Kathmandu Valley is an intermountain bowl-shaped basin comprised of both shallow and deep aquifers composed of fluvio-lacustrine sediments. Sandy gravel layers of northern side of the valley are considered the recharge zone due to the presence of unconsolidated coarse-grained deposits. Unfortunately, the area has the fastest urban growth and surface sealing, resulting in decrease in natural infiltration.

This article focuses on the issues of planning and designing water distribution systems of large irrigation systems at the irrigation service delivery level. The layout planning of an irrigation system is an important aspect of design for water distribution, typically guided by hierarchical system. This article also highlights the existing canal hierarchy of these systems and their appropriateness for efficient water distribution. Furthermore, the appropriateness of the structured system is also examined in the Sunsari Morang Irrigation Project.

Women do most of the water collection‐related tasks in the majority of low‐income country's urban areas, as they do in rural areas for drinking, household consumption, kitchen gardening, and farming. However, their voice is rarely heard in water governance. When climate change exacerbates water scarcity, it becomes harder for people to secure water with more pronounced effects on women. Drawing on the narratives of men and women involved in water management practices and also the views of the stakeholders who are part of water resource management in two towns in Nepal, this paper demonstrates emerging forms of gender inequality concerning access to and control over water resources, as well as associated services such as sanitation. We found that women's voice in water governance is systematically excluded, and such gender‐based disadvantage intersects with economic disadvantage as women in low‐income poor urban settlements are experiencing additional difficulty in accessing water and sanitation services. Gender inequity persists in the urban water sector, and of course the wider social structures, despite some progressive policy changes in recent years, such as the 30% quota reserved for women in local‐level water management bodies in Nepal. The paper concludes that tackling gender inequity in water management requires a transformative approach that seriously takes into account women's voice, critical awareness, and open deliberation over the causes and consequences of the current approaches and practices. Moreover, gender‐inclusive outcomes on water management are linked to changes in areas outside of the water sector, such as property ownership structures that constrain or enable women's access to water and related services.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wwp2.12052,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Imminent water crisis due to climate change, water demanding nature of traditionally cultivated rice, increasing scarcity of labor and escalating labor costs drive the search for alternative management methods to increase water productivity, system sustainability and profitability in rice cultivation. Direct seeded rice (DSR) technique has received much attention and popularity nowadays because of its low-input demanding nature that can mitigate emission of green-house gases and adaption to climatic risks. DSR involves sowing of dry seed into a prepared seedbed, pre-germinated seed into a puddled soil surface and standing water. The development of early maturing varieties and use of efficient nutrient management practices along with increased adoption of integrated weed management techniques have encouraged many farmers to switch from transplanted to DSR culture. DSR technology is highly mechanized in some developed countries like USA, Australia, Japan, China, Korea etc. This shift from traditional rice to DSR will substantially reduce crop water requirements, soil organic-matter turnover, enhanced nutrient management, carbon sequestration, weed management, greenhouse-gas emissions and enhance crop intensification. However, weed and nematode infestation, blast, panicle sterility, lack of suitable varieties for DSR and lodging are major challenges. Based on existing evidences, this paper reviews the integrated package of technologies for DSR, potential advantages and challenges associated with it.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44786/33689,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

We analyzed the qualitative data by thematic analysis and modeled quantitative routes to and consequences of psychological ownership in generalized estimating equations. Findings from qualitative and quantitative analyses converged to show that community members’ decision-making, investment of labor and money, and knowledge about the water system were associated with greater psychological ownership.

In this context, this research tries to answer the pertinent questions concerning the aquifer properties, depth and thickness of the groundwater aquifer layer and groundwater prospects for irrigation. The objective of this research is to identify the aquifer properties and groundwater prospects using two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography methods (2D-ERT). Five 2D-ERT profiles were used to collect information to a depth of around 40 m, with minimum electrode spacing of 5 m over a profile length of 240 m. The survey was carried out using Wenner electrode configurations. The resistivity tomogram sections were interpreted using RES2DINV software, which provides output in the form of resistivity contours that are used to draw up the lithological and geological information. The result of the survey indicates that the areas with good potential for groundwater access exist mostly along the southeast to central east parts of the study area, where there is gravel and sand with resistivity values between 100 and 500 Ω m. Areas along the northwest with clay and silty clay formations have low resistivity values (< 70 Ω m) and low groundwater potential. While the northeast has high resistivity values (> 2000 Ω m) due to sand formation underlain by boulder and cobbles, it also has limited groundwater potential due to the limited depth (< 6 m) of sand and low storage capacity. The study reveals a variation in lithological formation, including a patchwork of clay, silty clay, sand, gravel and boulder materials, with varying groundwater potentials. When developing shallow tube wells in the study area, spatial variation in the productive aquifer, hydraulic conductivity of groundwater flow within and near the tapped aquifer and geological and lithological material need to be considered.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13201-019-0971-3.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

We first use a bivariate probit model to examine stated preferences for (1) an increasing block tariff (IBT) and (2) a positive fixed charge. We find that household preferences for IBTs and fixed charges are not easily explained by household socioeconomic and water use characteristics. Second, we ask respondents what they think a fair water bill would be for a randomly assigned quantity of water. We model the responses as a function of both quantity and household socioeconomic and water use characteristics. While households support a water tariff that results in a household's water bill increasing as a household's water use increases, we do not find evidence that households support an increasing, nonlinear relationship between water use and a household's water bill. Our results suggest that respondents desire affordable piped water services and water bills that are calculated fairly for everyone. Because the notion of fairness in Kathmandu varies, utility managers may have considerable latitude in choosing a tariff structure that focuses on other objectives, such as cost recovery, revenue stability, and economic efficiency.",http://iwaponline.com/wp/article-pdf/21/S1/9/632456/021000009.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

To ensure the data's suitability for factor analysis using Principal Component Analysis, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, Bartlett's Sphericity test, inter-component correlations, and Cronbach alpha scores for internal consistency were checked, and principal components were extracted. A 25-item safety barrier to safety measures in building construction projects during the COVID-19 pandemic was identified through an extensive review of the literature; six components were retained using Principal Component Analysis which represented the model of choice and explained 62.86 % of the data variance. The components were; inappropriate safety guidelines, psychological working pressure, inadequate hygiene monitoring and control, lack of safety awareness, improper working culture, and insufficient planning and scheduling. The internal consistency for the retained components was high; Cronbach α scores ranged from 0.72 to 0.796. “Inappropriate Safety Guidelines” was the most critical barrier to implementing safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in building construction projects, according to the rankings of the six identified components. It is recommended that construction professionals and regulatory bodies prioritize the development and adherence to robust safety protocols tailored to pandemic conditions. Regularly updating and reinforcing these guidelines will be crucial in safeguarding the health and well-being of workers while ensuring project continuity.

This study aimed to study the incidence of Vibrio species and employ simple method for rapid detection of Vibrio cholerae from water samples of Sunsari, Nepal. Identification of V. cholerae through biochemical tests requires extensive labor and costs. In resource limited laboratories, isolation and identification of V. cholerae often becomes difficult. Therefore, this study also aimed for selecting scope of this methodology as a scientific outcome for rapid isolation and identification of Vibrio cholerae. A total of 100 water samples were collected from Sunsari district in which 25 samples were collected from sewage, 25 from pond, 25 from tap and 25 from tube well. The samples of collected water were sent to the microbiology laboratory of Central Campus of Technology maintained in ice cold box and were enriched in Alkaline Peptone water and selectively isolated from TCBS agar and NA agar without NaCl. Pathogens were isolated and identified by conventional microbiological techniques. Out of 100 water samples collected, sucrose fermenting Vibrio species were isolated only from 16 water samples. Further the selective isolation of V. cholerae from nutrient agar without NaCl isolated 6 isolates from sewage samples and 3 isolates from pond samples. The distribution of Vibrio cholera in the water sample was found to be 9%, distribution of V. alginolyticus was found to be 4% and distribution of V. fluvialis was found to be 3%. In this study, non-sucrose fermenting Vibrio species were not isolated from the water samples. However, sucrose fermenting Vibrio species was obtained with yellow pigmentation in TCBS agar medium. The yellow pigmented colonies of Vibrio isolates recovered from TCBS and even from Nutrient Agar devoid of sodium chloride provided sufficient evidence of V. cholerae after series of other biochemical tests. This study concludes that yellow colonies (sucrose-fermenting) of Vibrio from TCBS agar medium that can grow on nutrient agar without added NaCl and which exhibit a positive oxidase reaction can be confidently identified as presumptive V. cholerae. In resource-constrained environments, this simple method can reduce the labor cost, chemicals and time-consuming procedure of performing multiple biochemical and molecular assays for identification.",,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The study aimed to assess the water quality of the Bagmati River by analyzing the physical and chemical condition and comparing it with national and international standards. The water samples were taken from 10 different sampling sites along the length of the Bagmati River inside Kathmandu Valley, i.e., from Sundarijal to Saibubhanjyang. A total of 30 physical and chemical parameters were examined. The results showed that the pH ranges from 6.0 to 7.5 in different sampling locations. The highest dissolved oxygen (DO) (8.5 mg/L) was found at the upstream while the lowest, i.e., 3.4 mg/L and 3.5 mg/L, was found at the urban core of the valley, i.e., Teku and Thapathali, respectively. The BOD, COD, oil, and grease considerably exceeded the WHO and national generic effluent standard. Most of the heavy metals in the river water were below the range of standard. The concentrations of all pesticides were found below 10 µg/L except heptachlor exoepoxide. The highest concentration of heptachlor exoepoxide (75 µg/L) was found at Balkhu, followed by Thapathali (69 µg/L) and Teku (62 µg/L). The result showed that the middle-urbanized segment, i.e., from Gokarna to Teku, is heavily polluted than the upstream and downstream segments of the river. The results are of great significance for policy formulation and implementation of the ecosystem restoration project of Bagmati River in the Kathmandu valley, Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/njes/article/download/34314/27009,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Compared to foreign direct investment (FDI) or foreign aid (grants & loans), the money injected to the economy of Nepal through remittances is markedly larger. Huge investment in the real estate sector and large sums of money applied for share subscription indicate the need and opportunities of channelizing remittances in the infrastructure development and productive sector. However, most studies on remittances are focused on the ex-post analysis of the economy and few studies focus on the planning and policy issues aimed to utilize remittances. This paper reviews literature on utilizing remittance money and analyzes the prospects of capitalizing remittances in Nepal. A conceptual model is proposed on utilizing remittance money for infrastructure development. The proposed model of a remittance investment trust aims to synergize the three best attributes of the three domains of stakeholders, namely, abundant remittance money of the people, excellent management skills of the private sector, and the superior public trust to the government. Remittance money can serve as a great investment vehicle for executing properly investigated and attractive infrastructure projects. As estimated for Lumbini province, the remittance investment trust may contribute to fulfill 20% of the deficit of investment towards achieving the sustainable development goals. While the model is proposed for a province, it is expected to be replicable to the national and sub-national governments in Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/55075/42217,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Our research, in the form of a cluster-based controlled pre-post intervention analysis, investigated the impact of a combined water safety intervention on outcomes of microbial water quality, users' perceptions and piped system functionality in rural Nepal. The study enrolled 21 treatment systems and 12 control systems across five districts of the Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. Treatment group interventions included field laboratories for microbial analysis, regular monitoring of water quality including sanitary inspections, targeted treatment and infrastructure improvements, household hygiene and water filter promotion, and community training. In certain systems, regular system-level chlorination was implemented. Before and after the interventions, the microbial water quality was measured at multiple points within the water system. This information was complemented by household interviews and sanitary inspections.

The study involves the measurement of physicochemical parameters (pH, EC, EH, DO, TDS) of the observed 147 springs and the ionic concentration of the representative 32 springs along the Mai Khola Watershed using standard analytical procedure. The results of the physicochemical parameters and ionic concentration were analysed and interpreted using different indices and graphical methods. The physicochemical parameter suggests that spring water is weakly acidic to alkaline and the measured EC and TDS suggest low interaction of rocks and water therein. The piper diagram indicates Ca2+ and Mg2+ together (alkaline earth metals) dominate over combined Na+ and K+ (alkali metals) and Cl- and SO42- (strong acids) predominate over HCO3- (weak ones).

Zoological gardens (in short zoo), are an important form of ex-situ conservation which can play a diverse role in complementing in-situ measures of conservation, research, conservation financing, captive breeding and conservation education. Among these roles, conservation education is one front where zoos can play a pivotal role which is poorly explored in Nepal. Thus, in this article we have attempted to assess the role of Central Zoo in conservation. For this purpose, the responses of the respondents were collected by using the standard questionnaire. Data were managed in Microsoft Excel and the percentage of the respondents for each response category was calculated. Association between the variables was explored by using Chi-square test. Respondents perceived that the information boards are sufficient but they need to be complemented by dedicated staff for visitors who read and write. Furthermore, respondents perceive that their conservation mindedness such as willingness to volunteer in nature based organisation and activities, willingness to make donations and support the wildlife friendly policies were significantly enhanced after their visit to the zoo. These behaviours were found to be significantly associated with the frequency of the visit as frequent visitors were found to have more positive attitudes towards wildlife and environment. Most of the visitors claimed that they were satisfied with the visit and are willing to visit again. However, they have suggested care on aspects of animal welfare and conservation education.

A huge sum of money is invested in water supply projects and a significant percentage of those have become nonfunctional due to source drying. Most of the projects consider the supply side only- not sustainability. By that, the scarce public investment is wasted. Hydrogeological aspects including climate change, and source conservation were never been realized. Once the sources dry up, projects become redundant. People look for alternative sources requiring scarce public investment. Therefore, the Government of Nepal and development partners like Renewable World (RW) concluded that the sustainability of water projects is crucial and must be considered in the initial phases of project development. It can be assisted and achieved by hydrogeological evidence-based water source conservation planning. To implement it, an interdisciplinary research team of Nepal Water Conservation Foundation and RW conducted a hydrogeological study including the climate impacts and participatory planning applying different sets of tools and methods applied in social and natural sciences such as hydrogeological study, key informant interviews, focused group discussions and policy assessment. Consequently, 10 site-specific source protection and conservation plans for solar MUS schemes were developed. The study found four types of variables: (i) Precipitation and temperature: There was no significant impact of climate change in terms of rise in temperature and precipitation; (ii) Problems related to conservation: The major problems included drying up and displacement of springs by flood, landslide and road constructions; pollution through agricultural runoff, livestock grazing, and contamination by pesticides and chemical fertilizers; disappearance or conversion of traditional wallowing/recharge ponds; contamination and damage by flood; (iii) Innovation: Even a small innovation like Solar MUS can contribute in people’s life significantly through lifting water from downhill sources; (iv) Planning: Source protection and conservation plan can be formulated democratically and owned by local government and water user groups and implemented jointly.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57754/43197,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

This parturition suggested high reproductive potential. Its bite to a man walking on the road caused no ill-effects. However, the use of tourniquet as a part of prehospital care might be detrimental or be obstacle for in-hospital care of snakebite. The conflicts between E. enhydris and humans at roads and human-activity areas are inevitable across the distribution ranges of this species.

The high use of fossil fuels and biomasses results in measurable air pollution, even in the mountain areas. Hydropower planning and implementation, in the face of the changing climate, is therefore paramount important. We focus here on Nepal, and particularly on the Dudh Koshi river basin, with a population of ca. 170,000 people, within an area with large potential for hydropower production. Our main objectives are to (i) preliminarily design a local hydropower grid based on a distributed run of river ROR scheme, and (ii) verify the resilience of the grid against modified hydrology under perspective climate change, until the end of the century. To do so, we set up and tune the Poli-Hydro semi-distributed glacio-hydrological model, mimicking the complex hydrology of the area. We then modify a state of the art algorithm to develop and exploit a heuristic, resource-demand based model, called Poli-ROR. We use Poli-ROR to assess the (optimal) distribution of a number of ROR hydropower stations along the river network, and the structure of the local mini-grids. We then use downscaled outputs from three general circulation models GCMs (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 8.5) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC AR5, to assess the performance of the system under future modified hydrological conditions. We find that our proposed method is efficient in shaping ROR systems, with the target of the largest possible coverage (93%), and of the least price (0.068 € kWh−1 on average). We demonstrate also that under the projected hydrological regimes until 2100, worse conditions than now may occur, especially for plants with small drainage areas. Days with energy shortage may reach up to nf = 38 per year on average (against nf = 24 now), while the maximum daily energy deficit may reach as high as edef% = 40% (against edef% = 20% now). We demonstrate that our originally proposed method for ROR grid design may represent a major contribution towards the proper development of distributed hydropower production in the area. Our results may contribute to improve energy supply, and living conditions within the Dudh Koshi river. It is likely that our approach may be applied in Nepal generally. Impending climate change may require adaptation in time, including the use of other sources which are as clean as possible, to limit pollution. Our Poli-ROR method for grid optimization may be of use for water managers, and scientists with an interest in the design of optimal hydropower schemes in topographically complex catchments.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/9/2625/pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The two South Asian neighbours have entered into a number of agreements/treaties in water resources, namely, Sarada Agreement (1920), Kosi Agreement (1954), Gandak Agreement (1959) and Mahakali Treaty (1996). Nepal is criticized within the country for being unable to secure its benefits, and that all the agreements are in India's favour. However, the Indian side claims that overpoliticization of water issues in Nepal is the reason for not achieving the benefits from these agreements. Since the Mahakali Treaty, there has been deadlock in Nepal–India water cooperation as the implementation of the treaty has not materialized even after more than two decades since its ratification. Therefore, all the forms of cooperation in the past between Nepal and India can be viewed as the consequence of hydro-hegemony rather than mutuality.

In none of the countries did these improvements translate into an increase in the frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption, nor in the number of different fruits and vegetables consumed. These findings confirm the results of two major reviews of school garden programmes in developed countries. The results therefore suggest that for school garden programmes to contribute to healthier food choices a more holistic intervention design may be needed that addresses the household-level supply of healthy foods and influences the food choices of parents.",,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Such geological hazards pose a significant threat to the neighboring communities. The field survey reveals vulnerable engineering geological conditions and adverse environmental factors in the study area. It is found that a typical complete debris transport process may consist of two stages depending on the rainfall intensity. In the first stage, debris flows mobilized from a landslide have low mobility and their runout distance is quite modest; in the second stage, with an increase in water content they are able to travel a longer distance. Numerical simulations based on a multi-phase flow model are conducted to analyze the characteristics of the debris flows in motion, including the debris deposition profiles and runout distances in both stages. Overall, the numerical results are reasonably consistent with relevant field observations. Future debris flows may likely occur again in this area due to the presence of large soil blocks separated by tension cracks, rampant in the field; numerical simulations predict that these potential debris flows may exhibit similar characteristics to past events.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/16/11/1594/pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

All vegetation species in the sample quadrates were recorded. For probing water quality, lakes were divided into three blocks, then sampling was conducted on a consecutive day. Physico-chemical parameters —temperature, pH, electric conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solid (TDS), ammonia, and nitrate—were measured. A total of 55 species under 38 families and 28 orders were recorded from ecotone of Begnas lake. In Rara lake, 56 species of 41 families and 22 orders were recorded. Poaceae was the dominant largest family in Begnas which was followed by Asteraceae. In Rara lake, Rosaceae was the dominant family which was followed by Pinaceae. Temperature, pH, and DO values decreased with depth, but EC and TDS e increased with depth, in both Begnas and Rara lakes.

Old Padampur area lies in the lap of Rapti River with many streams and marshes in the area which contributes to its suitability. The grassland of Old Padampur area is the largest in the park. At present, the wild water buffalo is facing some conservation issues mainly due to improper execution of soft release strategy and few uncontrolled natural events, such as floods and predators attacks. Therefore, to maintain the viable population of wild water buffalo in Chitwan National Park in the long-run, it is crucial to regulate and enhance effective soft release strategy and more advance techno-based modality in close coordination with conservation partners and relevant stakeholders.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/forestry/article/download/28350/23279,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

This study aims at offering a fresh perspective on such policy gaps, by analysing how gendered discourses, institutions and professional culture contribute to policy gaps. We rely on a conceptual framework originally developed for analysing strategic change, which is used to analyse gender in the public water sector in Nepal. Our analysis relies on a review of national water policies and a series of semi-structured interviews with male and female water professionals from several public agencies. Our findings evidence how dominant discourses, formal rules and professional culture intersect to support and reproduce hegemonic masculine attitudes and practices of water professionals. Such attitudes and practices in turn favour a technocratic implementation of policy measures. We argue that gender equality policy initiatives in the water sector have overly focused on local level formal institutions and have not adequately considered the effects of masculine discourses, norms and culture to be effective in making progress towards gender equity.

Nepal has hitherto adopted an isolated and sectoral silo policy approach to development planning that has remained the dominant mode of planning across many countries in the world with few exceptions until recently when inadequacies of sectoral planning became apparent. The search for alternatively more integrative approaches came into the forefront of development discourse in the backdrop of shrinking natural resources, climate change, inexorable demand of a rapidly growing urban population, and other needs and requirements at a global scale.   The river basin-wide W-E-F-E nexus development policy strategy offers significant potential for optimum water resource utilization driving development of all sectors, including agriculture. The fundamental aspect of the W-E-F-E nexus policy framework entails the understanding of interdependencies and interactions amidst its components (water, energy, food, and ecosystem) and assessing their synergistic impacts on food, energy, water, and environmental securities in the basin. The W-E-F-E nexus policy framework aims to harness the synergy created from the interaction of interlinked components to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs).

If one looks at the total quantum of water that flows out of Nepal in one year, the above message sounds valid but as the flow of water is not under anybody’s control and flow occurs under gravity as it precipitates or exits the water springs, it should be considered in two dimensions: volume and time. In my opinion, Nepal is water stressed most of the time of year: flood stressed during the monsoon and drought stressed during the rest of the year. Nepal is rich in ice-mass, which is depleting at an alarming rate due to global warming giving rise to formation and increase in volume of glacial lakes that increases the vulnerability and risks to the economic activities along the river basins. Similarly, Nepal is rich ing round water resource with the total annual replenish able reserve of about 12 BCM mostly located in the Terai plains. The most debatable is the surface water that mostly falls as rain during the monsoon and cascades down crossing into India, is often devastating, as it passes. Nepal’s water resource is generally related to its hydropower potential calculated as 83,000MW by Dr. Hari Man Shrestha back in the sixties. Hydropower potential is a number that is based on the energy potential and the market, therefore, it is changing from time to time due to change in demand pattern and the market rates. Myopic view of looking at the Himalayan waters relating it to energy production as the energy production (TAF-June 2018) comprises a meager percentage of total benefit which lies mostly on multiple use of water directed towards the following two aspects: (1)Reduction in the losses of life and property due to floods and unwanted mountain phenomenon, mostly flood related disaster risk reduction, and (2) Flood Water management for converting the curse of floods into assets by way of its multiple uses, both consumptive as well as non-consumptive including food revolution, navigation, fishery, water supply, replenishment of ground water, energy production and recreation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/24569/20671,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Climate change is likely to undermine the ability of urban water supply systems to meet both the present and future needs of the population. Concerns have been raised about the existing water management policies inability to address the challenges of climate change and unplanned urban development. The paper investigates whether and how the sectoral policies on climate change, urban development and water address critical urban water issues and; how and in what ways these policies are linked (or not linked). Based on the analysis of urban, water and climate policies and drawing insights from water forum meetings organised in Dharan and Dhulikhel, we demonstrate that the existing urban, water and climate related policies have insufficient focus on urban water and lack effective interlinkages amongst these themes. Lack of awareness about the policy provisions, challenges and ambiguities in implementing the policy provisions, lack of recognition of the stakeholders’ role in policy formulation and its effective implementation, unclear provisions made in the policies appear as constraints for implementing the policies. We argue that a coherent policy framework would help to address the complex issues of urban water, shaped by climate change and urban development.  ",https://newangle.sias-southasia.org/index.php/new/article/download/4/49,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Against this backdrop, we analyzed the challenges households face due to ‘too much and too little water’. The research employed a qualitative methodology in which data were collected through 40 key informant interviews, informal conversations, and observations during 2020–2021 including a relevant literature review. We note that both ‘too much and too little water’ pose risks to water insecurity. Also, water security cannot be ensured by only dealing with water inadequacy without building a resilient water system and robust institutions. We found that water scarcity has affected other components of water security such as equity, quality, and affordability. Excess water has impacted water infrastructures, degrading the water quality, and risking human health and well-being. The responses to the water challenges were hindered by several constraints such as the limited capacity of the water institutions, frequent leadership changes, political influence, and emerging challenges in the federal context. We suggest timely planning and adopting site-specific innovations to address water scarcity and excess challenges, which include strengthening water services, infrastructures, institutions, and governance.",https://iwaponline.com/ws/article-pdf/23/4/1544/1214162/ws023041544.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Given the complexities of water usage within society, developing, allocating, and managing water resources equitably is a serious emerging challenge. This paper adopts a convergent mixed method approach to explore water inequity issues in water distribution and water quality among the core and peripheral wards of Dhulikhel, a mid‐hill town of Nepal. In doing so, the paper analyzes the determinants of inequitable water distribution in core and periphery wards, perception of water quality, and underlying causes of inequity in water quality in core and peripheral wards. The paper found that various socioeconomic, environmental, technological, and governance‐related factors are causing inequity in water distribution. Our analysis showed that climate change is adding on top of these existing challenges, exacerbating inequity in access to water. This paper also found that while core wards benefit from donor schemes that ensure good water quality, the peripheral wards do not enjoy the reach of such schemes, and given climate change impacts on rainfall patterns, seasonal availability of water is likely to be unpredictable in the future.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wwp2.12066,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

We investigate the differential impacts of climate change on different local social groups and their ongoing responses to the impacts taking the case of water governance and water security. The findings of the study clearly revealed that climate change and its associated impacts on the lives of people have further exacerbated the existing inequalities among the social groups – the access to drinking water for the marginalized social groups further declined because of drying of water sources and other disasters affecting the availability of water. Based on these empirical facts, this chapter highlights the need to develop an interdisciplinary approach to advance a research and policy agenda on climate justice and disaster risk management (with valuable insights from elsewhere). We conclude that a climate justice framework is needed in the context of Nepal that considers distributional, capabilities, procedural, and recognition issues and aspects of vulnerability, resilience, and adaptive capacity. Based on the findings of the study, we also complicate the current debate around climate justice in Nepal, and how can they be applied in research and development interventions related to climate change (for adaptation) and disasters.

The marginalization of the indigenous communities has its roots in the ideas propagated by western experts on conservation and imposition of American models of protected areas. This has given conservation efforts its militant and intolerant nature. This is ill-suited for the context of South Asia, and particularly the Chitwan National Park Area. The restrictive laws that are based on these notions of estranging people from nature are further marginalizing a vulnerable section of the population. In this context, Hayekian ideas of spontaneous order and the criticism of expert knowledge gives critical insight to see the inadequacies and articulate the ‘misfit’ nature of the current model of conservation. From the study of works of Easterly, Hayek, and Ostrom, it is suggested to be sensitive to the existing people-nature relationship, and give due credence to the dispersed and localized traditional knowledge that may offer deeper insights to benefit the conservation efforts.",,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

In the case of Nepal, river waters are the basic sources of all these elements and are the only resources available indigenously in Nepal for these purposes. Rapti (West), being medium size river of rain-fed nature, the dry spell continues long from December up to the end of May; at the same time the flood waters available particularly in July, August and September create havoc by flooding in the downstream reaches. The Kapilvastu area which can be commanded by the Rapti (West) river does not have other dependable sources for fulfilling its requirements. The only way to fulfill its requirements without affecting downstream users is, thus, to capture a portion of flood water of Rapti behind a storage dam aimed at diversion to Kapilvastu for use during dry season. An appropriate site for such purpose is located at Bhalubang. Hence, this site needs to be developed first to ensure the diversion to Kapilvastu and then a much higher storage dam site at Naumore could, later at appropriate time but within 25 to 30 years after development of Bhalubang site, be developed for increasing the flow regulation potential of the Rapti River so that the hydropower generation, flood control and intensification of irrigated agriculture at its commendable areas, could be maximized. HYDRO Nepal Journal of Water Energy and EnvironmentVolume- 18, 2016, JanuaryPage -1 to 5",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/14634/11862,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

A number of hurdles come across when a potential site has to be exploited, thus, all theoretically and/or technically available potential cannot actually be developed/ exploited. Nepal is not an exception in this respect. Exploitation of run-of-river schemes has much less hurdle in comparison with storage development. The storage development, particularly the larger scale development, has even international implications, because the benefits of such development spread far beyond the national boundary. In the Nepalese case the downstream country, particularly India, is reluctant to recognize the downstream flow regulation benefits arising from flood-control and dry season flow augmentation. As such the current focus of exploitation of Nepalese hydro-potential should be on run-of-river type development and smaller size storage developments which can easily be materialized without much hurdle, but in a coordinated and well scheduled manner in a way not to hamper the larger storage development at the opportune future dates.HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water, Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 19Page:1-5",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/15340/12405,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Failure in either one of these leads to the whole system failure. Once the system is technically feasible, we can manage its social aspects. In this paper, we deal with technical sustainability of corrosive water, its impacts and the remedial measures. Corrosive water can severely damage intakes, metal pipes, cemented chambers, concrete reservoir and household plumbing systems. Hence, it is necessary to identify the corrosiveness of the water and should be neutralized. There are several solutions to this problem, however, they are not sustainable and economical for semi urban and rural communities. In this paper, we propose a sustainable, natural and economical solution to determine the corrosiveness of water and to effective technology to neutralize it. The proposed solution uses naturally available resources, hence makes it sustainable and affordable. Once the proposed method is deployed, it doesn’t require additional resources such as continuous monitoring, skilled manpower and electrical power cost etc. In this method, initially, the corrosiveness of the water is identified using parameters such as: total dissolved solid (TDS), pH, temperature, calcium and alkalinity. The corrosive water is then analyzed in laboratory. With carbon dioxide kinetic study, we verify the design of stabilization tank volume calculation. The research outcome is applied in the field to upgrade intake, pipe and fitting designs.

Using data from 620 randomly selected CFP and non-CFP forest plots, we apply a robust matching method based on covariates to estimate whether CFPs are associated with greater biodiversity conservation or carbon storage. Our results reveal a significant positive effect of CFP on biodiversity, which is robust against the influence of unobserved covariates. Our results also suggest a significant negative effect of the CFP on aboveground tree and sapling carbon (AGC) at the national scale (-15.11 Mg C ha-1). However, the CFP has a mixed effect on carbon across geographic and topographic regions and in forests with different canopy covers. Though there were no significant effects of the CFP on AGC at lower altitudes, in the Terai or hill regions, and under closed canopies, there were positive effects in open canopies (25.84 Mg C ha-1) at lower slopes (25.51 Mg C ha-1) and negative effects at higher altitudes (-22.81 Mg C ha-1) and higher slopes (-17.72 Mg C ha-1).

The study shows that despite some initiatives by government, NGOs, bilateral agencies and media to improve land tenure security, land tenure insecurity prevails in all areas of the country even in registered lands. It is found that stable  rganization, registration of most of the built-up and cultivated land, advocacy to protect the right of landless has strengthened the land tenure security. However, the tenure rights of socially and economically disadvantaged people and displaced people from disasters have not been properly addressed and those people are at high risk of eviction from the place they are living.

The favorable government policies and peaceful native people of the Nepal Himalaya have welcomed thousands of tourists, trekkers and researchers to fulfill their various aspirations and interests. However, the country is often blamed for causing the so-called eco-crisis in the region. During the 1970s and 1980s, publishing several books and articles with attractive titles, some mountain experts showed solidarity with those who propounded a hypothetical theory of Himalayan environmental degradation on the basis of the limited samples collected from a few localities. In this context, the present study is an attempt to review the available literatures and case studies in order to evaluate the potentiality of the so called eco-crisis/environmental degradation in the Nepal Himalaya areas.

The modeling tool, Long-range Energy Alternative Planning System (LEAPS) has been used to develop a bottom-up model to estimate the energy demand and environmental emissions in the Kathmandu valley for the period 2016-2030 AD. Besides the Reference scenario, four alternative scenarios (Public Bus Penetration, Improved Fuel Economy, Electric Motorbike and Hybrid Electric Car) have been developed. In the Reference scenario, the cumulative energy demand will reach 142,092 thousand GJ within the analysis period. About 65% of this demand comes from motorbikes and light duty vehicles. If all of the alternative scenarios are implemented together, about 38% of energy demand and 54% of CO2 emission can be avoided compared to the reference scenario within the study period.

RWHS will always be limited in Nepal due to monsoonal rainfall patterns however this high quality water supply should be prioritised for cooking and drinking. Increasing catchment areas to at least 30 m² instead of increasing tank volumes can efficiently increase the water supply. A literature review on the quality of harvested rainwater was completed, and recommendations were made for maintaining the high quality of water throughout collection, conveyance, storage and use. Monitoring and evaluation of installed systems is necessary and recommendations need to be further investigated and considered in Nepal where the social and cultural context can be fully understood.

To explore potential expansion plans, the 48 hydropower plants (20 of which are currently operating) within 18 hydro networks and two diesel plants are included, and different options such as the possibility of export, seasonal variations in hydrology, and projected growth rates in gross domestic product are considered. The results illustrate the long run marginal cost (LRMC) and loss of load probability (LoLP) through 2030 in Nepal. It is found that LRMC is 3.50 Nepali Rupees per kilowatt hour at 4.1% of average LoLP. While scrutinizing the results, it is found that LoLP is higher in early stage of projections due to generation capacity limitations from 2014 to 2016. However, by the end of 2017, the LRMC and LoLP begin to decrease significantly. On this premise, the model suggests to introduce large storage plants for hydropower generation and export of that excess energy. Furthermore, a proper implementation of proposed peaking and storage plants to meet rising demand can offset the need to obtain electricity through more expensive and less environmentally-friendly means such as thermal/diesel plants.HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water, Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 19Page: 45-51",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/15352/12413,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The PV systems were installed on the rooftop of the Nepal Telecom office at Sundhara, Pokhara, and Biratnagar. The generation data was collected through the web interface of the data logger installed at the sites. Long-term comparison (four years) of the plant at Sundhara and the same system comparison of plants at Pokhara and Biratnagar were performed. Long-term analysis of the plant at Sundhara found that the final yield decreased from 2.91 kWh/kWp in 2019 to 2.21 kWh/kWp in 2022. Similarly, the performance ratio decreased from 91.0% in 2019 to 67.3% in 2022, capacity utilization factor decreased from 12.1% in 2019 to 9.2% in 2022, and system efficiency decreased from 16.8% in 2019 to 12.5% in 2022.  The same system installed at Pokhara and Biratnagar had slightly varied performance owing to the variation in meteorological parameters. The average air temperature at Biratnagar (26.7°C) was higher than at Pokhara (13.1°C) while the amount of solar radiation at Biratnagar was just higher by 4%. This led to the reduction of final yield by 9% at Biratnagar than at Pokhara as higher temperatures at Biratnagar caused more reduction in the power output from the solar panels. Finally, this study provides insights to researchers, PV installers, and panel manufacturers on the actual performance of grid-connected solar PV in Nepal.",https://nepjol.info/index.php/scitech/article/download/60496/45197,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Disturbance-dependent grasslands, often associated with hydromorphological and fire dynamics, are threatened, especially in subtropical climates. In the Nepalese and Indian Terai Arc Landscape at the foot of the Himalayas, natural and cultural grasslands serve a viable role for rhinos (Rhinoceros unicornis) and the prey of the Royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris). The grasslands are vulnerable for encroachment of forest. We aimed to establish the effects of environmental drivers, in particular river discharge, river channel dynamics, precipitation, and forest fires, on space-time dynamics of these grasslands. The study area is the floodplain of the eastern branch of the Karnali River and adjacent western part of Bardia National Park. We created two annual time series of land cover with the use of field data, remotely sensed LANDSAT imagery and a supervised classification model. Additionally, we analysed aerial photographs of 1964 and the pattern of grassland patches. From 1964 to 2019, grasslands saw a transition to forest and grassland patches decreased in size and number. Outside the floodplain, successional setbacks of grassland coincide with extreme precipitation events. Within the floodplain, successional setbacks of grassland correlate with the magnitude of the annual peak discharge. However, this relationship is absent after 2009 due to a westward shift of the main discharge channel of the bifurcated Karnali River with a vast expansion of alluvial tall grasslands (Saccharum spontaneum dominant) as consequence. Since 2009, hydromorphological processes in the floodplain have become more static. This is supported by an observed decrease in water coverage (-53 %) in the dry season, an absence of successional setbacks, and decreased morphodynamics of river channels. For forest fires, the surface area that annually burns is observed to be more variable in recent years and the maximum extent affected by fires is in an increasing trend. Because the hydromorphological processes in the floodplain have become more static, other sources of disturbances – ephemeral streams, anthropogenic maintenance, grazing and fires – are more paramount to prevent encroachment of grasslands. Altogether, our findings underscore that a change in the environmental drivers impact the surface area and heterogeneity of grassland patches in the landscape, which can lead to cascading effects for the grassland-dependent fauna.",,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

While the purpose of this activity is to generate locally relevant knowledge on the physical processes behind natural hazards, we concentrate here on its implementation, i.e., to obtain a better understanding of the dynamic of the activity and to learn how it should be implemented. We determined the social capital of secondary schools as a gateway to the local community: they provide a unique setting to bring different stakeholders together. We find that co-designing a teaching programme is an effective means of both complementing local curricula and ensuring continued buy-in of local stakeholders (i.e., teachers). Student engagement depends on the local relevance of teaching materials, with more holistic or global concepts, such as climate change of lesser importance. Our activity focused on rainfall, including student-led data collection. These rainfall data provide a very good fit to co-located rain gauge data, with an average difference on weekly readings of 11.8%, reducing to 8.3% when averaged over all student readings. The autonomous development of student-organized science clubs suggested that our original framework underestimated students' capacity to apply knowledge elsewhere creatively. These clubs may be used to obtain participant feedback to improve and tailor future activities. Quantitative assessment of long-term sustainability remains challenging, due in part to high levels of student turnover. We suggest that integrating scientists wherever possible within a school or local community has a direct and positive result on participant retention.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frwa.2020.581375/full,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The Himalayas of South Asia are home to many glaciers that are retreating due to climate change and causing the formation of large glacial lakes in their absence. These lakes are held in place by naturally deposited moraine dams that are potentially unstable. Specifically, an impulse wave generated by an avalanche or landslide entering the lake can destabilize the moraine dam, thereby causing a catastrophic failure of the moraine and a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). Imja-Lhotse Shar glacier is amongst the glaciers experiencing the highest rate of mass loss in the Mount Everest region, which has contributed to the expansion of Imja Tsho. A GLOF from this lake may have the potential to cause catastrophic damage to downstream villages, threatening both property and human life. Therefore, it is essential to understand the processes that could trigger a flood and quantify the potential downstream impacts. The avalanche-induced GLOF process chain was modeled using the output of one component of the chain as input to the next. First, the volume and momentum of various avalanches entering the lake were calculated using RAMMS. Next, the avalanche-induced waves were simulated using BASEMENT and validated with empirical equations to ensure the proper transfer of momentum from the avalanche to the lake. With BASEMENT, the ensuing moraine erosion and downstream flooding was modeled, which was used to generate hazard maps downstream. Moraine erosion was calculated for two geomorphologic models: one site-specific using field data and another worst-case based on past literature that is applicable to lakes in the greater region. Neither case resulted in flooding outside the river channel at downstream villages. The worst-case model resulted in some moraine erosion and increased channelization of the lake outlet, which yielded greater discharge downstream but no catastrophic collapse. The site-specific model generated similar results, but with very little erosion and a smaller downstream discharge. These results indicated that Imja Tsho is unlikely to produce a catastrophic GLOF due to an avalanche in the near future, although some hazard exists within the downstream river channel, necessitating continued monitoring of the lake. Furthermore, these models were designed for ease and flexibility so that they can be adopted by a wide range of stakeholders and appropriated for other lakes in the region.",https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/hess-2017-683/hess-2017-683.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Data were gathered using key informant interviews, focused group discussions, stakeholder consultations and participant observations. The key forms of conflicts emerged from the case study include a) upstream-downstream contestation for access to and/or control over water; b) tension caused by disparities in water distribution within urban region and c) competing use of water for domestic and other purposes. The major drivers of such conflicts include growing water demand both in upstream and downstream areas, declining water sources exacerbated by climate change and urbanization. In both cases of Dhulikhel and Bidur, water for municipal supply was acquired from upstream rural areas using political influence. However, the agreements forged between towns and upstream villages were later contestedby empowered upstream people. This suggests that socio-political relations have key role in governing water access. Insights from these cases reinforces the argument that local water management is a political agenda and resolving contestation and conflicts require enhanced cooperation and deliberation.

One can use the model based either in demand side or in supply side. This paper considers electricity as an essential factor of production. Thus it uses the demand side model to reexamine the association and determine the causality between the variables electricity consumption (EC) and gross domestic product (GDP) of five south Asian countries during the period 2000-2011 AD. A panel unit root test, panel co-integration test are used to determine the long run equilibrium. Fully modified ordinary least square method was applied to estimate the panel electricity elasticity coefficient. Granger causality based on Vector Auto Regression model was then applied to determine the direction of causality. The data are found stationary at first difference but are found non-stationary at their level. Co-integration test confirmed the long run relationship or equilibrium between the variables EC and GDP. The electricity elasticity coefficient (EEC) is 1.31. It reveals that a 1% increase in electricity consumption would lead to increase the GDP by 1.31% indicating a highly responsive electricity demand. In the spontaneous process of economic development of south Asian countries, there is a significant impact of EC on GDP. The value of EEC is self-spoken. A large change in GDP would be expected from a small change in EC. It has a big implication of bringing rapid economic progress within a short span of time and any shortage of electric energy would retard economic progress. Electricity consumption is found to Granger cause GDP. This unidirectional causality running from electricity consumption to GDP has important policy implication-electricity consumption leads economic growth which has two policy implications. One, reduction of electricity consumption through bringing domestic energy prices in line with market prices would lead to fall in GDP or employment. Two, electricity consumption bears the burden of short run adjustment to reestablish the long run equilibrium.                                        HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 20Page: 18-22",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/16484/13407,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The aim of this study was to investigate the seasonal variations of in-situ groundwater physicochemical parameters, evaluate groundwater hydrochemistry with respect to water types, and identify groundwater chemistry control mechanisms by analyzing spring water. The area's geology is dominated by schist and gneiss. Depression and fracture springs occur widely. The study involved observation of seasonal variations in in-situ physicochemical parameters, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature, and major ion concentrations – Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3−, Cl−, SO42− – to describe the water's chemical characteristics. The seasonal variations in physicochemical parameters arose mainly from monsoonal precipitation and its interactions with host rocks. Chemical analysis showed that Ca-HCO3 type water dominated, indicating shallow aquifer groundwater processes. The relative abundance of cations was, in order, Ca2+ &gt; Na+ &gt; Mg2+ &gt; K+ and of anions HCO3− &gt; Cl− &gt; SO42−.

The disaster revealed long-standing weaknesses in water and sanitation systems in the country. Anticipating a cholera outbreak in 2016, UNICEF, Johns Hopkins University, and the Group for Technical Assistance partnered to support the Government of Nepal to ensure a safe water supply and improve sanitation and hygiene. This article discusses challenges, gaps, lessons learned and recommendations that were drawn from the authors' experience in cholera prevention and control in post-earthquake Nepal. Challenges identified include lack of regular water quality testing and monitoring, inconsistent use of point-of-use water treatment products, and lack of a fast-track mechanism for rapid response.

This study aims to characterize the physiochemical parameters of three lakes in the Bharandabhar forest corridor, Chitwan, Central Nepal: Tiger Lake, Kalimati Lake, and Rhino Lake. During the pre-monsoon season, four different sites (Eastern, Western, Northern, and Southern) of each lake were examined. To ensure precision, five replicated water samples were collected from each site, and standard protocols were applied to analyze various physiochemical parameters, such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, free carbon dioxide, total hardness, chloride, total alkalinity, conductivity, nitrate, inorganic phosphorus, and total solid matter. Also, the Water Quality Index (WQI) was calculated. Results show that physiochemical parameter values mostly align with permissible limits according to regional and international guidelines. However, the mean phosphorous concentration and pH values of Tiger and Kalimati lakes exceed these limits. Rhino Lake displayed a mildly alkaline pH, while Kalimati and Tiger lakes exhibited slightly acidic characteristics. An interesting observation is the significant negative correlation between temperature and dissolved oxygen, indicating that as temperature rises, dissolved oxygen levels decrease. Additionally, WQI suggests that all three lakes maintain good water quality. However, a concerning finding is that all three lakes exhibited hyper-eutrophic conditions based on their phosphorous concentration. The lakes face significant threats due to high levels of organic pollutants and a rapid eutrophication process. Authorities must take significant actions to safeguard the lakes and ensure their future well-being. This research highlights the urgent need for environmental protection and conservation efforts to preserve the water quality and ecological balance of the Bharandabhar forest corridor lakes for the well-being of both human communities and the ecosystem.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/sj/article/download/64320/48776,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Though earthen canal sections are least expensive, simple to maintain and environmentally friendly, they have high seepage rates and demand frequent repair. In the light of need for resource conservation and the general unavailability of labour for maintenance work, a canal lining, though more expensive, may be justifiable in the long run. Technological advances in the construction have made available lighter and more affordable materials that enhance many parts of the irrigation process.It is the private sector that should lead the development of these technologies as they relate to the construction business. We can look to foreign markets to see how canal lining technologies have improved the use of this tool in various environments and soils. In the Nepali context, we use traditional lining techniques like stone or reinforced concrete, which are effective in the plains, but less so in the hills and remote.

These changes have tremendous effects on agriculture systems especially in the areas where rainfall is the precondition of agriculture. This paper will investigate monsoon patterns in Nepal and how they correlate with recorded rice yields. The results were analyzed and cross-checked with AquaCrop, a crop water productivity model. The findings indicate that the Nepal’s monsoon patterns do not follow a definitive trend. Parameters such as onset and withdrawal dates, duration and distribution are quite unpredictable. The patterns, however, do have direct impact on national average rice yields, but that effect has turned less sensitive in recent years. The findings suggest that though monsoon has vital role on rice production in Nepal, where agriculture systems depend primarily on rainfall, more research is required to predict more accurately and precisely the production functions and relationships to yield. The better we understand this relationship, the more we can compensate for adverse monsoon patterns through anticipatory deployment of ag-technologies and advanced management options. Furthermore, support from legislators will be required to move these ideas into practice.

A total of 40 water samples from five sites in each river system were collected from January (winter), March-April (spring), June (summer) and October (autumn) in 2018; and some important irrigation water quality parameters were assessed. All the assessed parameters viz. pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Total Hardness (TH), permeability index (PI), percent sodium (%Na), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), magnesium hazard (MAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Kelly’s index (KI) from all sites were observed suitable for irrigation. USSL diagram showed that water from both the rivers belongs to the S1-C2 category indicating good for irrigation purposes. The Wilcox diagram revealed that all samples fall into the excellent to a good class. Based on Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI), 3 sampling sites fall in the high restriction category and 7 sampling sites fall in the moderate restriction category, indicating anthropogenic impacts on irrigation water quality at some sites.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/njes/article/download/47867/38551,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

This study describes the major ions and hydrochemistry of the first ever ongoing IBWT from snow-fed Bheri River to rain-fed Babai River in Western Nepal. Water samples from 10 sites, five from each river system, were collected in HDPE bottles for major ions (Ca^(2+), Mg^(2+), Na^+, K^+, HCO_3^-, Cl^-, SO_4^(2-), NO_3^-, CO_3^(2-)) along with the estimation of pH, temperature and conductivity encompassing winter, spring, summer, and autumn in 2018. Ca^(2+)and HCO_3^- were the most dominant cation and anion, respectively, with 〖Ca-Mg-HCO〗_3 water type in both the river systems. Mann Whitney test revealed significant variation (p<0.05) between the two river systems with regard to Ca^(2+), Mg^(2+), HCO_3^- , and SO_4^(2-). Kruskall Wallis test revealed significant variations between seasons in pH, temperature, Na^+, K^+, and Cl^- in Bheri River system, and in pH, TDS, temperature, Na^+, K^+ , Cl^- and SO_4^(2-) in Babai River system. Carbonate weathering was the main mechanism of ionic sources with insignificant contribution from silicate weathering. Relatively higher concentrations of the major ions during the dry seasons probably indicate the dilution effect of monsoon. Higher concentrations of the ions in the Babai River system reflect the latter’s bedrock geology with susceptibility to erosion. With Nepal’s future plans of IBWTs and their environmental implications, this finding could be helpful in mitigating the negative consequences of IBWTs in the impact assessment and management of IBWT projects because of their implications on management of aquatic resources.",,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The concept of urban governance and water security is inextricably tied as the need of improved water services historically grew with the expansion of cities calling for critical governance arrangements. In light of the above, this paper examines the existing state of water security in Dhulikhel. By examining the power relations between ‘fringe’ and the ‘core’ areas, the paper depicts the growing inequity across the 9 wards of Dhulikhel pertaining to water access and distribution based on caste, class, ethnicity and gender. Two fundamental questions that guide this paper are: 1) Why disparities exist between the core and fringe categories in Dhulikhel Municipality? 2) How does the core-fringe category shape the power of communities in the water governance? The findings clearly show that there is a huge discrimination between the core and the fringe, the poor and the non-poor within the core in water availability, distribution and decision making. Establishing an equitable water justice system calls for uprooting the existing social discrimination in water security to empower the fringe communities.",https://newangle.sias-southasia.org/index.php/new/article/download/10/8,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

A study was carried out to assess the impact of climate change on yield and irrigation water requirement of these cereal crops in Bhaktapur, Nepal. Laboratory and soil-plant-air-water analysis showed silt-loam being the most dominant soil type in the study area. A yield simulation model, AquaCrop, was able to simulate the crop yield with reasonable accuracy. Future (2030–2060) crop yield simulations, on forcing the Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) based on regional circulation model simulation indicated decreased (based on HadCM3Q0 projection) and increased (based on ECHAM5 projection) yield of monsoon rice for A1B scenario, and rather stable yield (for both projection) of winter wheat. Simulation results for management strategies indicated that the crop yield was mainly constrained by water scarcity and fertility stress emphasizing the need for proper water management and fertilizer application. Similarly, a proper deficit irrigation strategy was found to be suitable to stabilize the wheat yield in the dry season. Furthermore, an increase in fertilizer application dose was more effective in fully irrigated conditions than in rainfed conditions.",http://iwaponline.com/jwcc/article-pdf/8/2/320/522791/jwc0080320.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

This study presents a comparative analysis of WPI to assess the water stress in two local units i.e., Mahakali Municipality-4 (Upstream) and Bhimdatt Municipality-13 (Downstream) of the Darchula and Kanchanpur districts, respectively along the Mahakali River Basin (MRB), Sudurpaschim Province, Nepal. Five components, i.e., resource availability, use of resources, capacity to utilize water sources, accessibility to water sources, and environment were applied to appraisal the water poverty. Under these components, 28 indicators were selected to visualize the water poverty condition. The information for acquiring these indicators was collected by making the field visit, semi-structured questionnaire survey, and secondary information from relevant sources. The results showed that the downstream segment has a higher WPI value (65.43) in comparison to the upstream segment (52.60) of the MRB, indicating relatively water-advantaged and stressed situations in down- and up-streams, respectively. Interestingly, despite having higher resource availability, the upstream region exhibited more stressed situations reflecting spatial heterogeneity in terms of capacity, environmental conditions, and infrastructure development to use the available water resources. Thus, in order to reduce the water stress conditions, priorities for intervention must be given to the water use capacity, especially in the upstream segment of the MRB. This study could be useful for academia and policymakers for the sustainable use of water resources in the MRB, Susurpaschim Province, Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/njz/article/download/33887/26610,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The Nepal population of Assam macaques (<i>Macaca assamensis</i>) (NPAM), the westernmost population of the species, is morphologically distinct but has never been used in phylogenetic analyses. Here, the phylogenetic relationship of NPAM with other congeners was tested using multiple mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal loci. The divergence times and evolutionary genetic distances among macaques were also estimated. Results revealed two major mitochondrial DNA clades of macaques under the <i>sinica</i>-group: the first clade included <i>M. thibetana</i>, <i>M. sinica</i>, and eastern subspecies of Assam macaque (<i>M. assamensis assamensis</i>); the second clade included <i>M. radiata</i> together with species from the eastern and central Himalaya, namely, <i>M. leucogenys</i>, <i>M. munzala</i>, and NPAM. Among the second-clade species, NPAM was the first to diverge from the other members of the clade around 1.9 million years ago. Our results revealed that NPAM is phylogenetically distinct from the eastern Assam macaques and closer to other species and hence may represent a separate species. Because of its phylogenetic distinctiveness, isolated distribution, and small population size, the Nepal population of <i>sinica</i>-group macaques warrants detailed taxonomic revision and high conservation priority.",http://www.zoores.ac.cn/en/article/doi/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2020.279,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

This article uses participatory research methods to document and analyse (1) local and regional impacts of climate change on ecosystem services (ES) and livelihoods, and (2) the main current adaptation strategies of local peoples in the mountains of central Nepal. Major observed impacts include reduced precipitation and an irregular rainfall pattern, affecting paddy cultivation and winter crop production. Production is also affected by increased pest and pathogen prevalence. Other impacts include increased livestock disease and reduced forest regeneration. Our results confirm earlier findings of a decrease in the district's forest cover in past; however, substantial efforts in forest conservation and management at the local level have gradually increased forest cover in recent years. Despite the increased potential for forest ecosystem services, the availability of forest goods, in particular fuel wood, fodder and litter, have decreased because of a strict regulation on forest goods extraction. Additionally, new invasive species are colonising these forests, preventing regeneration of preferred and local forest vegetation in some areas and, as a result, the densities of tree crops are changing. Most users cope with these changes by short term, reactive solutions. However, a number of local adaptation strategies, such as changing both agricultural practices and water harvesting and management, are increasing efficiency in resource use. To increase the adaptive capacity of poor households, we suggest it is essential to incorporate climate change adaptations within the local planning process.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/21513732.2015.1027793,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Available data were collected from the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MoAD), Department of Agriculture (DoA) and Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC). Green house gas emission (GHG) was estimated by using IPCC 2006 guidelines. Agricultural activities contribute directly to emissions of greenhouse gases through a variety of processes including the source categories such as enteric fermentation in domestic livestock, livestock manure management, rice cultivation, and agricultural soil management. Diverse traditional agriculture systems, unique diversities in land types and unavailability of required disaggregated data at the national level as defined by the emission factor data base (EFDB) of the IPCC 2006, were the problem encountered while calculating the emission status in this study. Annual methane (CH4) emission from paddy fields ranged from 111.57 to 133.07 Gg over years 2000 to 2010 but it was found lowest ( 111.57 Gg) in the year 2002 and highest (133.07 Gg) in the year2003.

The study shows that the innovative monitoring mechanism such as, letter monitoring, hello monitoring, sensor monitoring, and toll-free monitoring are useful tools for efficient and effective monitoring of rural drinking water system in the context of developing countries like Nepal. Considering the innovative monitoring ladders and on-site monitoring, the study further concludes that a combination of two or more innovative monitoring mechanisms will make more sense for effective and efficient monitoring mechanism to keep the projects functional and sustainable. This study may be useful for development actor in the sector, academia, and policy makers. The study can be further extended by capturing learning from the implementation for these innovative monitoring mechanism in the context of rural and urban drinking water sector in Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/njmr/article/download/51808/38780,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The review was made through descriptive comparison, percentages, graphs, and ratios to compare whether the country’s status is in line with the global context. The study concludes that the proportion of the population having safely managed water services in Nepal (16 percent) is quite lower than the global average (73 percent). Moreover, the proportion of the population having safely managed sanitation services in Nepal (51 percent) is slightly lower than the global average (57 percent). Similarly, the proportion of the population having basic hygiene services in Nepal (64 percent) is lower than the global average (75 percent). Furthermore, the findings on the status of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) systems are mixed in the context of Nepal. Some of them have good progress and some of them need to be accelerated to go a long way to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030. The study further concludes that institutionalization, policy and legislation, and accountability mechanisms at the federal level have been initiated while it is yet to materialize at the provincial and local levels. In the case of planning, only 10 percent of rural/municipalities completed their WASH plan. In terms of finance, there is not only a resource gap but also two-thirds of the total country’s WASH budget has been allocated at the federal level.

However, around 80 percent of remittance received by households is used only for consumption purposes in Nepal. Despite the increasing importance of remittance in the Nepalese economy, the relationship between remittance and private consumption has not yet been adequately studied. Hence, the prime objective of this paper is to analyze the effects of remittance on private consumption expenditure in Nepal. The ARDL bounds testing model is employed in the study to identify the effects of remittance on private consumption in Nepal. The time series data for 20 years, 2001-2020, are collected from various government sources, such as the Ministry of Finance, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), and the National Statistics Office. This study finds a positive and significant relationship between remittances and private consumption in Nepal. The impact of other control variables like GDP is positive and significant for consumption. However, the consumer price index has a negative effect on consumption. The Nepal government and other concerned agencies should encourage sending remittances only from formal banking channels that could help with capital formation and thereby investment and job creation in Nepal.

The Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP) is an interbasin project aimed at diverting 510 MLD of water in three phases (170 MLD in each phase). Phase I of the project was expected to complete by 2018. Water demand forecasting is the first and important activity in managing water supply. Using the socio-economic factors of number of connections, water tariff and ratio of population to number of university students and climatic factor of annual rainfall, artificial neural network (ANN) was used to predict the water demand of Kathmandu Valley until the year 2040. The analysis suggests that, even after the completion of Phase I of MWSP, the water scarcity in the valley will be 160 MLD in 2020. Therefore, Phase II of MWSP should be completed within 2025 and Phase III should be completed by 2040. The result of this study aids KUKL for better management of the water system.

In this context, increasing competition for water has in many instances resulted in the fulfillment of water needs of some groups, while compromising the water needs of others.  In such instances, it is usually the poor and marginalized groups who are disproportionately affected. Moreover, understanding the factors affecting equitable access to an adequate supply of water now particularly after Nepal’s entry into the new federal governance system, and COVID-19 pandemic is paramount.

We understand institutional barriers to be factors challenging the implementation of inclusive design criteria of water-user groups, which stem from the complexities of gender, class and caste norms in a particular context.2. WUGs are registered in a designated governmental agency. They comprise households accessing water in certain locations by making cash, in-kind and/or labour contributions. A WUC is an elected body of a WUG that leads water utilization and management decisions (GON, Citation1992).3. The Ministry of Water Supply in Nepal's National Water Sanitation and Hygiene (NWASH) defines 'functionality' as the percentage of water facilities that are working. Water facilities are a water supply system with pipelines, reservoirs and taps that provide all services. Permanent structures must have a tap. Quantity, velocity, pressure, water quality and flow duration define a 'working' tap. NWASH recognizes that measuring all five characteristics is expensive, time-consuming and difficult (NWASH, Citation2021).Additional informationFundingThis study was supported by the Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) Water for Women (WfW) Fund to the International Water Management Institute's (IWMI) research project 'A Gender Perspective to Understand and Enhance the Functionality of Water Supply Systems: Lessons from Nepal' [grant number WRA094].

One third of GDP comes from agriculture and there are numerous opportunities in agriculture mainly because of varied agro-climate prevailed in the country. Niche specific commodities that have comparative advantage could be produced in fair quantity to meet the demand of huge market of neighboring India and China as purchasing capacity of people in those countries has improved markedly mainly for quality agriculture commodities. Trade deficit, food insecurity, income generation, poverty reduction, and employment generation could be addressed by turning present status of subsistence agriculture into robust, vibrant and commercial agriculture through technology led agro-industrialization. There are agro-commodities which are imported from India and other countries in huge quantity by the scarce hard currency earned through remittance. Evidence shows that almost 70% of the remittance is spent for agriculture commodities which have high potentiality to produce within the country even after local consumption. Such produce could be exported to other countries to mitigate trade imbalance, enhance export promotion and import reduction and promote graduating Nepal from LDC to DC within the stipulated time frame as proposed a couple of years ago by the government of Nepal. Nepal should come up with functional, pragmatic and implementable agriculture plan and policy to harness huge possibility of agriculture commercialization to meet the consumption demand per se within and outside the country. This paper highlights to address prospects and limitations of agriculture commercialization and suggests some way forward to make agriculture more vibrant and robust to address trade deficit, food and nutritional insecurity and livelihood enhancement of Nepalese as a whole thereby Nepal can tailor her pace of development with neighboring countries to meet the aspiration of Nepalese in the 21st century.Agronomy Journal of Nepal (Agron JN) vol. 4, 2016, Page: 38-63",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/15515/12519,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

This paper aims to analyze the constraints and opportunities of vegetable farmers in Kirtipur. Altogether 80 farm household survey were conducted in four major areas of Kirtipur. A total of 20 key informant interviews (KII) were also conducted to understand the perception of farm households on commercial vegetable farming. The result shows that around 94% of the total sampled farm households have leasehold farmland that has spread to different settlements of Kirtipur Municipality. Out of total leasehold farmers, 69% have written agreement with the landowner. The result also shows that the farmers cultivate vegetables in an average area of 5.67 ropani (2884.49m2). Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) are the primary vegetable products, whereas cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) and other green leafy vegetables are mostly cultivated as secondary vegetable products. Dug wells are the major sources of irrigation on vegetable farmland. Out of the total sampled farm households, about 42% of farmers are associated with farmers group and 37% have basic training on vegetable farming. Majority of farmers have savings from vegetable production and marketing. Despite few constraints like price fluctuation (81%) and high middleman margins (71%), vegetable farming in Kirtipur has many opportunities particularly being a major source income and livelihood (93%), self-employment generation (87%) and growing market demand (83%). The opportunities in commercial vegetable farming have continuously attracted the farmers in Kirtipur; however, the existing constraints has deprived farmers from their expected returns. Therefore, this paper recommends to portray possible options to promote opportunities and overcome the existing constraints to retain commercial vegetable farming as a sustainable source for farm households in Kirtipur.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23418/19847,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The Government of Nepal has committed and prioritized improving the quality of water services by implementing climate-resilient water safety plans (CR-WSPs) in 10 WSSs as pilot projects. In this study, how tough is water sanitation and hygiene (HTIW) framework was adopted to assess the effectiveness of these CR-WSPs, which include four groundwater and six protected springs-based WSSs. Employing the HTIW framework, this study adopted the six key indicators environment, infrastructure, management, community governance and engagement, institutional support, and supply chains to evaluate CR-WSPs effectiveness. The indicators were then assessed using a Likert scale. Resilient schemes are needed to demonstrate a capacity to respond effectively to challenges such as unforeseen extreme events and potential hazards, together with an aptitude for financial management, laboratory maintenance, and social inclusion. Less resilient schemes tend to be those linked to social inclusion or financial issues. Institutional support and supply chain domain scored four and were relatively strong among them. The findings of this study suggest that CR-WSPs can be an important metric tool to assess climate resilience and guide policymakers in low- and middle-income countries.",https://iwaponline.com/aqua/article-pdf/73/7/1437/1460858/jws0731437.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The government has been spending a significant portion of its budget on imports, and it aims to reduce this dependence by increasing domestic production and achieving food security goals. To understand the dynamics of this issue, system dynamics modelling steps were employed. The key variables considered in the model testing were domestic production, imports, per capita consumption, productivity per hectare, and average area expansion rate. The study utilized time series data from 1991 to 2020 and projected the analysis up to 2050 using Stella Architect, a computer-based software program. The findings reveal that both the population and imports have exhibited exponential growth over the years. The model also indicates goal-seeking behaviour, with the government setting targets for yield increment based on available harvest areas. However, the policies implemented thus far have mostly been quick-fix approaches focusing input subsidized programs. According to the model, an increase of 70-100% in rice production will be required by 2050 to meet the growing population's demand. The study presents three policy options for achieving rice self-sufficiency: 1) a 2% annual increase in average area expansion, 2) raising productivity from 3700 kg ha-1 to 5000 kg ha-1 and 3) increasing productivity to 3900 kg ha-1 while reducing per capita rice consumption from 200 kg to 130 kg. The study suggests that adopting the recommended policy implications can help increase rice production in Nepal. Decision-makers should adopt a dynamic approach to the rice production system to address the issue of slow growth and achieve national self-sufficiency and food security goals.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/62168/46954,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Every year, there are countless morbidity and mortality due to the consumption of unsafe drinking water. Recently, there have been increased uses of bottled drinking water in an assumption that the bottled water is safer than the tap water and its use will help to protect from water-related diseases. So, the main objective of this study was to analyze the bacteriological quality of bottled drinking water and that of municipal tap water.A total of 100 samples (76 tap water and 24 bottled water) were analyzed for bacteriological quality and pH. The methods used were spread plate method for total plate count (TPC) and membrane filter method for total coliform count (TCC), fecal coliform count (FCC), and fecal streptococcal count (FSC). pH meter was used for measuring pH.One hundred percent of the tap water samples and 87.5 % of the bottled water samples were found to be contaminated with heterotrophic bacteria. Of the tap water samples, 55.3 % were positive for total coliforms, compared with 25 % of the bottled water. No bottled water samples were positive for fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci, in contrast to 21.1 % and 14.5 % of the tap water samples being contaminated with fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci, respectively. One hundred percent of the tap water samples and 54.2 % of the bottled water samples had pH in the acceptable range.All of the municipal tap water samples and most of the bottled drinking water samples distributed in Dharan municipality were found to be contaminated with one or more than one type of indicator organisms. On the basis of our findings, we may conclude that comparatively, the bottled drinking water may have been safer (than tap water) to drink.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s41043-016-0054-0,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Various types of urban and rural water supply and sanitation projects are now being implemented within the Government, private and NGO sectors. The normal practice of measurement of satisfaction by service providers is to measure consumers’ satisfaction on past performance. The survey design could vary from survey questions to unstructured interviews and everything in between using comparative and non-comparative scales. In comparative scaling, the respondents are asked to compare one product against the other while non-comparative scaling is used to evaluate a single product. In this study, Likert Scales is used in this study for measurement of customer satisfaction on water supply. The higher level of satisfaction with water supply is expected to be positively related to several factors such as satisfaction with water quality, and other parameters such as hours and timings of water supply, tap pressure, quantity of water supplied, responsiveness and communication of management and water tariff. The respondents’ level of satisfaction indicates that about 41 percent of respondents were neutral, they were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with water services, while about 36 percent of respondents were satisfied with water services. The satisfaction scale of overall satisfaction with water services was 3.29 while 1.0 indicates strongly not satisfied while 5.0 indicate strongly satisfied. The various aspects that influence satisfaction among users which include hours and timings of water supply, tap pressure, quantity of water supplied, responsiveness and communication of management and water tariff as well as redresses of customer complaints have been examined.

This study examines the impact of natural disaster on household access to drinking water taking a case of Nepal’s 2015 Earthquake. Drawing on data from four rounds of the Annual Household Survey (AHS) spanning from 2013/14 to 2016/17, the study employs a difference-in-difference research design to examine how households were impacted in accessing drinking water in the earthquake affected districts of Nepal. The results reveal that households in earthquake affected regions experience a decline in the use of piped drinking water by six-percentage-points compared to other sources of water notably wells, spring and rivers. Concurrently, there was a corresponding increase in the use of open water sources, particularly rivers and springs, for drinking among these households. These findings underscore that during disaster, sources like rivers and spring water can serve as essential alternatives for households, especially in the Hill and Mountain regions of Nepal, where other drinking water alternatives are less feasible. However, it is an important to note that these open water sources are often deemed unsafe for consumption and carry potential health risks. In light of these insights, this study emphasizes the necessity for disaster preparedness plans to prioritize establishing mechanisms that guarantee the safety of such open water sources for drinking during natural disaster and extreme events in the future.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/58535/43803,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Using data from the third wave of the Household Risk and Vulnerability Survey 2018, logistic regression is employed to analyze both the likelihood of LPG adoption and household expenditure on LPG under conditions of natural shocks. The findings reveal that households experiencing natural shocks are 5 percent less on average likely to adopt biogas or LPG. Furthermore, household expenditure on LPG decreases by 4.43 percent relative to cooking fuel expenses particularly for firewood by the households experiencing natural shocks. This reduction highlights a decline in the intensity of clean energy use among households concurrently using LPG and firewood.

Ethnographic data suggest that household water insecurity could increase women's exposure to emotional and physical forms of intimate partner violence (IPV), as punishments for failures to complete socially expected household tasks that rely on water (like cooking and cleaning) and the generally elevated emotional state of household members dealing with resource scarcity. Here, we test the associations between sub-optimal household water access and women's exposure to IPV, using the nationally-representative data from Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, 2016. Drawing upon the intra-household bargaining model as the theoretical framework, we run instrumental variable probit regression, to test the association between household water access and prevalence of IPV against women. After controlling for other known covariates of IPV such as women's empowerment and education, the findings substantiate that worse household water access consistently elevates women's exposures to all forms of IPV. This suggests that improvements in household water access may have additional ramifications for reducing women's risk of IPV, beyond currently recognized socioeconomic benefits. While both household water access and IPV have known health consequences, linking them provides another pathway through which water could affect women's health.",http://iwaponline.com/jwh/article-pdf/18/4/579/731100/jwh0180579.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Although minimum wages remains an utmost prority as a redistributive tool, studies shows that its fixation are mostly driven by political interest of the incumbent government and the interest of the private sector. Nepal is not an exception to this. This paper attempts to propose a need based method of setting minimum wages for Nepal. In addition to the food and non-food information, unlike previous need based approaches, this study uses housing information from the nationally representative household survey to derive the minimum wages for Nepal.

The household survey was carried out in Kailash (hill) and Nayabasti (terai) of Chitwan. Descriptive analysis, mean comparison, correlations, and biodiversity indices were used for data analysis. On the basis of biodiversity index, evenness, the adequate number of species, and Sorenson’s coefficient, open-pollinated (OP) (nonhybrid) vegetables were more diverse in hills than in terai, while hybrid vegetables are more diverse in terai than in hills. Hybrid vegetables were mostly grown in terai, where the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides was also higher. OP vegetables dominated hilly areas. Gurung ethnic community had a significant role in the conservation of indigenous vegetable biodiversity. The primary source of seed was home storage in the case of OP vegetables in hills. However, in terai, agro-concerns were used as a significant source of seeds, followed by co-operatives. Co-operatives’ involvement was high in terai as compared to hills, but the role was not significant in vegetable farming. In contrast, assistance in vegetable farming from agriculture service provider organizations was higher in hills as compared to terai. The major problem in vegetable farming was lack of irrigation in both areas, followed by market inaccessibility in hills, whereas climate change was rising as a problem in terai. Markets of produced goods were farm gate, local markets, and distant markets. A middleman mostly did the price determination of the products. Off-season vegetable farming was not practiced in the study areas. However, off-farm vegetable production was typical in hilly areas. Indigenous and OP vegetable biodiversity has been facing various challenges despite their roles in nutrition, indigenous knowledge promotion, and food security. Hence, it is suggested to strengthen government policy toward irrigation facility development, gene bank establishment, marketing facilities, and technology transfer and develop on-farm community based intense organizations for sustainable vegetable diversity conservation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/29731/23899,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Being a basic human need, essential to live a healthy life, drinking water scheme rehabilitation project was initiated by many non-governmental agencies in coordination with the Government of Nepal (GoN). However, due to the limitation of the funds and time, most of the implementing agencies faced problems to prioritize schemes and the communities, which at first needed to focus to reinstate. Therefore, a vulnerable ranking method was adopted to distinguish the priorities to reconstruct damaged and totally destroyed water schemes in Dhading, Gorkha, Nuwakot, and Rasuwa districts of Nepal, which are the districts in the most earthquake affected region. In the process of vulnerability ranking, three major community level parameters and indicators were considered for the ranking. 1) Number of households without safe drinking water after an earthquake, 2) Number of households without improved sanitation after an earthquake, and 3) Disadvantage Group (DAG) ranking of the Village Development Committees (VDCs) of the districts.

The objective of this study was to prepare an inventory list of wetlands, categorize the wetlands based on the coverage of alien species, identify the problematic aquatic invasive plant species, and assess their impact on water quality and aquatic biodiversity (fish and macroinvertebrates). This study was conducted in winter and spring seasons of 2018. Composite water samples were collected from the wetlands with different covers of invasive species. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected using hand net of 500µm mesh following the habitat specific sampling approach, and fishes were sampled using Cast Net. The analysis of water quality parameters, macroinvertebrates and fishes were performed for different levels of invasion. Altogether, 66 wetlands were documented in the Buffer Zone located in the east of eastern embankment of the KTWR. Out of the total 66 wetlands, 33.33% were found to be non-invaded while 66.67% were found to be invaded by the invasive macrophytes. The invaded wetlands were further subdivided into abundant 'A' (>75% coverage), common 'C' (50-75% coverage) frequent 'F' (25-50%coverage), occasional 'O' (5-25% coverage), and rare 'R' (1-5% coverage) which were found to have occupied 19.69%, 16.67%, 12.12%, 13.63% and 4.50%, respectively, of the invaded wetlands (66.61%).

Bringing the time series trade data from reliable sources, this study also attempts to highlight import dependency ratio, correlation of population and GDP per capita growth with total import and pin down plausible reasons behind these pictures. The correlation study between import data to population growth and GDP per capita showed a positive correlation with r values 0.71 (p<0.05) and 0.99 (p<0.05), respectively. National supply sides when combine with domestic production mimics aggregate rice demands and these figures show increasing patterns accompanied by growing imports together with import dependency ratio. India alone dominates the rice trade which accounts for more than 90 percent of Nepal’s import in recent years. These noticeable surges in rice imports can be attributed to liberal trade policies of the respective trade partner countries, improvement in incomes, closer proximity, similar languages, and consumer preferences among others. Opening a domestic market for rice cannot be denied theoretically in favor of welfare-improving policy tools, however, it should be carefully considered to protect local farmer’s concerns. Though growth in rice productivity is encouraging over the recent previous years, there is ample potential to increase further by integrated programs combining expansion of spring paddy, inputs, irrigation, and technology. Moreover, attention should be paid toward consumer’s fine rice preferences aligning farmer’s motivations. The introduction of fiscal policy with application of tariff or non-tariff measures at least for a few years can encourage the domestic rice industry. Above policy adjustment can drive Nepal toward its rice self-reliant footing.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44796/33691,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

We consider that the experience gained in RVWRMP provides relevant lessons on how to safeguard the functionality of rural water services infrastructure systems. The key elements noted by our staff are: prioritisation of the schemes by the community; application of quality implementation and user committee management; Water Safety Plans and active maintenance; and hands-on technical support and monitoring.",http://iwaponline.com/washdev/article-pdf/5/4/625/385529/washdev0050625.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Local levels of government may play a role in tackling local water problems in a fair manner, or in failing to adapt to changing conditions. Nepal has recently undergone rapid changes in its institutional governance setting. Rural Municipalities (RMs) were established in mid-2017 as new, democratic, local tiers of governance. Their responsibilities include ensuring equitable access to water for all citizens, in line with the new Constitution. RMs must tackle decreasing water availability, increasing demands for domestic, agricultural and commercial uses, impacts of climate change, and the challenges of ensuring inclusive and participatory decision-making. At the same time, they are newly appointed finding their position and responsibilities after years of management by line ministries in Kathmandu. The study analyzes the current status of rural municipalities in remote areas of Sudurpashchim and Karnali Provinces in terms of their institutional capacity to implement inclusive water governance and water security in collaboration with a large donor project. It uses the OECD Principles on Water Governance (OECD 2011, 2015) as a framework. This research asks what the current water governance issues are in this setting of collaboration. The opportunities identified include the potential for more accountable policy formulation at a closer level to the community, by leaders who are more representative and accountable to their citizens and are aware of specific local water issues. On the other hand, there is a risk that policy formulation and accountability of governance could go astray. We conclude that this is a key moment to support the fledgling rural municipalities and demonstrate ways to build their capacities to secure safe water for all.",https://newangle.sias-southasia.org/index.php/new/article/download/8/6,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

However, mainstreaming climate change issues into sectoral policies from the government can be seen as recent activities in Nepal. Nepal has contributed negligible amount of emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) of global greenhouse gas, it is the fourth most vulnerable country in the world. In this context, this paper aims to review climate change adaptation policies in terms of sectoral integration. This paper has adopted text-mining method for information retrieval and knowledge mining and followed step-by-step approach to undertake review of policies. It concludes that National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010 can be a milestone in sectoral adaptation of climate change issue largely because it has provided the national framework for sectoral adaptation to climate change. However, NAPA ignores the importance of structural and institutional reforms needed for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into sectoral agencies. Climate change Policy, 2011, Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) 2011, Constitution of Nepal, 2015, Local Government Operation Act (LGOA) 2017, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017 and National REDD+ Strategy, 2018 are other prominent legislative and policy frameworks that have significant contribution in sectoral integration of climate change adaptation issues. However, lack of climate change act in order to implement fully these policies into practice for its implementation can be a major obstacle to achieve the goal.

Institutional and Legislative Systems (ILS) approach has been adopted focusing on three aspects: i) legal and regulatory frameworks, ii) policies and programs, and iii) organizational/institutional set-up. This paper concludes that newly endorsed Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act (2017) can be a milestone in disaster management of Nepal not only because it has replaced about 40 years old Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 but also for the first time, it saw disaster risk management as an process focusing on different stages of disaster management cycles, preparedness, response and rehabilitation and mitigation. The provision of well-structured functional institutional set-up from the centre to local level can have positive outcome in disaster management. However, it overlooks significant aspect, such as the declaration of disaster-prone zones limiting the right of provincial disaster management committee only for recommendation to the Government of Nepal. Most of policies, strategies and legislations focused on some specific disasters such as flood, landslide, earthquake and GLOF/avalanches at national level paying less emphasis to the local level. Even now, most of the policy interventions towards different cycles of disaster risk management have laid emphasis on preparedness and response rather than to rehabilitation and mitigation. The conflicting provisions in Acts such as Water Resource Act (1992) and Building Act (1998) with Local Government Operation Act (2017) have made overlapping of their roles and responsibilities. So, the policy formulation and institutional set-up needs to be complemented by the ability and competence to operationalize the intent of the relevant acts and policies at all levels of government.The Geographical Journal of NepalVol. 11: 1-24, 2018 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/19546/16004,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The deformation in the tunnel takes place to such an extent that it is irreversible and of significant magnitude, which is often known as tunnel squeezing. In order to limit such plastic deformation in tunnels, it is desirable that the response of the rock mass to induced stresses is known so that requirement of rock support can be estimated. Contrary to the assumption of uniform in-situ stresses made in analytical solutions for elasto-plastic analyses, large degree of stress anisotropy condition prevails in most tunnelling conditions. The effect of such anisotropic stress condition leads to varying degrees of deformations around the tunnel contour. Therefore, stress anisotropy is also an important factor that needs to be addressed to ensure a proper support design for tunnels. This paper discusses the inter-relationship among rock mass property, in-situ stresses including horizontal to vertical stress ratio, tunnel support pressure and deformation. The study is based on the tunnel cases from the Nepal Himalaya. Three completed tunnel projects were selected, where moderate to large tunnel deformations had been recorded. Long term deformation records were analyzed to assess time independent and time dependent deformations. Results of the analyses of the tunnels in weak and schistose rock mass at stress anisotropy states show that a good correlation among tunnel strain, rock mass shear modulus, support pressure, vertical stress and stress ratio of horizontal to vertical stresses exists. Moreover, the study also shows that significant amount of time dependent deformation can occur in such weak rock mass. Such deformation was found to be high in schist and micaceous phyllite, moderate in graphitic phyllite and low in siliceous phyllite. The suggested relationships can be used as a basis for an early estimate of instantaneous and final deformations and the corresponding requirement of support pressures in tunnel walls in weak and schistose rock mass.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/hn.v16i0.12212HYDRO Nepal  Journal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue. 16, 2015 January Page: 7-13 Upload date: March 1, 2015 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/12212/9902,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

It completed at Benighat, the location where the Tamakoshi River converges with the Saptakoshi River. The Sunkoshi River enters Nepal from high-altitude sources and flows through the country's hills, forests, and plains before merging with the Saptakoshi River in India. During its trip, the river receives contributions from many tributaries. A comprehensive evaluation of water quality was conducted by closely monitoring various physicochemical parameters, including temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids, turbidity, water velocity, electro-conductivity, depth, pH, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, acidity, alkalinity, nitrate, ammonia, chloride, iron, phosphate and total hardness as calcium carbonate content. Fish species richness was continuously assessed throughout the seasons, spanning from March 2022 to February 2023. The study identified five specific sampling locations: upper Dolalghat, Pachuwarghat, Kusheshwarghat, Khairenighat, and lower Benighat (Dovan), where the Tamakoshi River meets the Sunkoshi. All measured physical and chemical parameters were found to be within acceptable values. There was a total of 65 fish species identified, which were classified into 4 orders and 10 families. Among these, the family Cyprinidae had the highest diversity of species. This study highlights the importance of the Sunkoshi River as a crucial channel connecting Tibet and India via the Himalayan basins of Nepal.

The conservation history began formally after promulgation of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act in 1973. National parks and wildlife reserves were established across the country during the 1970s. However, very soon not only some of the adversities were faced by the local people living around the parks and reserves but also the space constraint was realized for the population distribution and dynamics. By realizing the need of people’s participation in the conservation initiatives, country has tested the concept of different types of protected areas system such as national park, wildlife reserve, conservation areas, and buffer zones over the years.

Forests are critical to the global C cycle because they store large amounts of atmospheric C in biomass and soil. The estimation of the C sequestration potential of any forest is crucial since it significantly contributes to the mitigation of global climate change. In this context, we estimated the biomass and C sequestration on two contrasting aspects of Pinus roxburghii -Sarg forest in Daman hill in Makawanpur district, Nepal. The study found that tree density of 210 per ha in the southern aspect, while in the northern, it was found 180 per ha. Tree biomass estimated on the southern aspect was 434.68 t ha-1 and 426.16 t ha-1 on the north. Accordingly, on the southern forest, C stock was found to 204.30 t ha-1 as compared to 200.32 t ha-1 on the north. Both biomass increment and C sequestration rate was found to be higher on the southern aspect than the north. The study suggests that dbh classes, and aspects factors play a crucial role in biomass and C sequestration. P. roxburghii forests are important C sinks because of their capacity to store large amounts of C in biomass. Thus, conservation and sustainable management of these native forest ecosystems are suggested.

The gap between women’s responsibilities in irrigation and their voice in local irrigation management organizations is well documented, in Nepal as well as elsewhere. Existence of this gap is often seen as an indicator of gender inequity, reflecting wider power imbalances between men and women. In Nepal, the need for bridging this gap has been realized in the last decades on grounds of efficiency, equity, and sustainability. More recently, participation of women in resource management organizations is also linked to concerns of democracy and justice. In recognition of these concerns, the government of Nepal has incorporated in its policies and laws explicit rules and measures aimed at improving the gender balance in WUAs. Nepal’s eighth five-years plan first mentioned the need to promote women’s participation in agricultural and forest cooperatives. Partly reflecting the intentions of the five-years plan, the irrigation policy of  included a provision to the effect that executive committees of WUAs should have at least  percent female members (HMG/MWR ). The Irrigation Regulation of  finally made women’s representation in executive committees of WUAs mandatory by statutory law. It stipulates the compulsory presence of at least two women members in executive committees of at most nine members. Through the example of a WUA in the Tukucha Nala irrigation system, this chapter explores the effects of these quota rules on actual participation of women in decision making. It looks at how national policies are used and how they receive meaning in the actual practices and negotiations of engineers, project staff, and water users at different levels of bureaucratic planning and project implementation.

As such, in a historical manner, Nepal is not only losing the opportunity of capitalising on its water resources, but also fixing itself in a vulnerable position in terms of the water securitisation.

In a severe power and energy crisis situation in the country, power export is not recommended. Nepal needs 3000 MW to reach the level of other south Asian nations. INPS is owned and operated by NEA; therefore NEA also has the responsibility to prepare master plan for power generation, transmission and distribution. But, the Department Electricity Development a regulatory body of Ministry of Energy of is undertaking / carrying out feasibility study without taking care of INPS/country’s power requirement. This has created duplication of work and confusion; as such the Ministry of Energy deviated from its responsibility of preparing sound policy, regulation and monitoring them strictly.

Employing the Milankovitch Theory, it explores Earth-Sun relationships and their impact on long-term climate changes, shaping societal adaptation strategies. Utilizing the Water Deficit Model, the study unveils the multifaceted consequences of water scarcity of Gandaki Province's Marshyangdi River basin. The study employs a comprehensive design, sampling 317 households across diverse ecological zones and elevations. The study finds the existing month-long water deficit in these cities to the higher water demand of households, along with water stress in the cities of Himal and Terai more than in the Hill. Water deficit is higher in Himal than in Hill and Terai because of lower water availability in Himal (below average 0.9). The people of Himal and Terai have extremely high stress but the people of Hills are comfortable without stress, except in Bandipur for drinking and cleanliness. In the 20 litres per capita per day water, water stress is found mixed. Five small cities in Himal and Terai are extremely stressed, meanwhile, 7 small cities in the Hill are not stressed, except two cities, Bandipur and Marshangdi. Relatively, the water deficit in the Hill is less than Himal and Terai. Similarly, in 20 liters per capita per day water, it is good for households but most cities have extreme water stress. The Hill’s water stress is lower than that of the Himalayan and Terai. By WHO’s standard (50 liters-100 liters per day per capita), all cities are extremely water deficient and critically water stressed. The findings reveal a direct correlation between water deficit and stress, impacting survival, hygiene, and living standards.

However, the energy law and policy emerge as a concern all over the world and states are taking initiative to ensure a balance among these three dilemmas. It is the reality that Bangladesh suffers severe shortage in power generation which also affects its overall economic development. Hence, in one hand, it needs to ensure continuous energy supply which is closely connected with country’s energy security also. On the other hand, it also needs to make a balance between the challenges of producing energy in affordable cost which will not adversely affect the environment as well. Nevertheless, Bangladesh, being a lower-middle income country at least put focus on the energy law and policy triangle in recent years. Still ensuring balance among these three opposite directions is still a challenge for Bangladesh.

The water footprint of crops production for any district or basin represents the average of WF production of seven crops in the respective district or basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides a picture of green and blue water use in crop production in the field and reduction in the water footprint of crop production by selecting suitable crops at different places in the field. The Crop, that has lower water footprint, can be intensified at that location and the crops, having higher water footprint, can be discontinued for production or measure for water saving technique needs to be implemented reducing evapotranspiration. The water footprint of agriculture crop production can be reduced by increasing the yield of the crops. Some measures like use of an improved variety of seed, fertilizer, mechanized farming and soil moisture conservation technology may also be used to increase the crop yields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crop harvested areas include both rainfed as well as irrigated land. Agricultural land occupies 22% of the study area, out of which 94% areas are rainfed whereas remaining 6% areas are under irrigation. The study shows 98% of total water use in crop production is due to green water use (received from rainfall) and remaining 2 % is due to blue water use received from irrigation (surface and ground water as source). Potato has 22% blue water proportion and contributes 85% share to the total blue water use in the basin. Maize and rice together hold 77% share of total water use in crops production. The average annual water footprint of crop production in KRB is 1248 cubic meter/ton having the variation of 9% during the period of 2005-2014. Sunsari, Dhankuta districts have lower water footprint of crop production. The coefficient of variation of water footprint of millet crop production is lower as compared to those of other crops considered for study whereas sugarcane has a higher variation of water footprint for its production.&lt;/p&gt;",,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

In the rural hills of Nepal, subsistence farming communities typically use RWS to support income-generating productive activities that can enhance rural livelihoods. However, there is limited research on the extent of existing productive activity and the factors enabling these activities. This paper examines the extent of water-related productive activities and the factors driving these activities based on a study, undertaken between October 2017 to June 2018, of 202 households served from five single-use domestic water systems and five multiple use water systems in the mid-hills of Nepal. The research found that a majority (94%) of these households engaged in two or more productive activities including growing vegetables and horticulture crops, raising livestock, and producing biogas and Rakshi (locally-produced alcohol), regardless of the system design, i.e., SUS vs. MUS. Around 90% of the households were engaged in productive activities that contributed to over 10% of their mean annual household income ($4,375). Since the SUS vs. MUS classification was not found to be a significant determinant of the extent of productive activity, the households were reclassified as having high or low levels of productive activity based on the quantity of water used for these activities and the associated earned income. A multinomial logistic regression model was developed to measure the relative significance of various predictors of high productive activity households. Five dominant predictors were identified: households that farm as a primary occupation, use productive technologies, are motivated to pursue productive activities, have received water-related productive activity training, and have received external support related to productive activities. Whereas MUS are designed for productive activity, nearly every household in SUS communities was involved in productive activities making them ‘de-facto’ MUS. These results challenge the current approach to rural water provision that views SUS and MUS as functionally different services.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/11/10/1978/pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Remittances are considered to be the most significant source of foreign currency that makes strong position of balance of payments, whereas the volume of imports is one of the most significant elements that lowers the volume of foreign currency reserve of the nation. It is generally believed that remittances have positive effects on volume of imports. On the contrary, if there is more imports than exports, it may run out trade deficit. It does make negative impact on the exchange rate of the home country. A weaker currency can raise the value of remittances sent back to the country, encouraging migrants to send more money home that influenced in growth of remittance. To analyze the relationship between remittance and imports, the study used annual data for 46 years from 1975 to 2020 A.D. The study used Vector Autoregressive model as there is no co-integration between the variables as per Johansen's technique. The variance decomposition test is carried out in a similar manner. The results demonstrate that there is a close connection between remittances and imports. But surprisingly, the result of VAR Granger causality test reveals that imports cause remittance rather than the other way around.

The main intention behind the designing of the scheme was to develop strategy for equitable use of water resources and involve communities, watershed and water user, in the sustainable management of water resources. We administered household survey in both the watershed community and water users to elicit their preferences regarding water source management and drinking water supply. A discrete choice experiment was employed in the case of water users which showed that, for them, water quality and quantity are the most important attributes. The estimated annual willingness-to-pay of water users for doubling water availability is NPR 482,076 (USD 4,505) and for doubling the water quantity and the supply of clean water that can be drunk directly from the tap is NPR 1.18 million (USD 10,988). The results of consultations with stakeholders indicate that the construction of public toilets, the regularization of grazing, off-season vegetable farming and drinking water distribution in the upstream area may contribute to maintaining the quality of water while keeping the watershed community satisfied with regard to water-sharing. These activities require NPR 1.17 million (USD 10,987) in the first year and NPR 425,640 (USD 3,978) annually from the second year on. The estimated willingness-to-pay and cost of the watershed activities indicate that implementing IPES in the Baitadi Town Water Supply Project is financially feasible and socially acceptable. Our study recommends the integration of the IPES design into the project design phase in future drinking water scheme, the best option being its integration into the initial environmental examination at the time of project design.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S2382624X18500029,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

In addition, the springs of such areas were exposed to higher contamination of biological pollutants compared with the rural areas. Synthesis of spring research in Nepal shows that springs of Nepal are degrading at an alarming rate where 16% had already dried up and about 60% have declining discharge, mainly due to declining rainfall, haphazard infrastructure development, and excessive spring resource exploitation. In response to the degrading springs and water crisis, several initiatives have been made, yet they are scattered, focused on limited springs, and not adequate to curb the current rate of spring degradation.

All three elements of the framework should be addressed along with a good understanding of the context and vulnerability where an irrigation system is situated. The specific interventions may include considering the entire river basin rather than looking solely at individual systems, enhance technical design, improve water use efficiency, adapt agricultural practices, improve water use governance and build robust institutions, among others.

The paper shows that the remittance inflow and economic growth have bidirectional relationship in the long run, but there is no relationship in the short run. Remittance affects the dynamics of other variables like investment, financial development, and investment on human capital which indirectly affect the performance of the economy through these variables. Findings indicate that remittance could promote financial development in the short run. It also shows the possibility of negative shocks in remittance flow could have a permanent negative effect on educational attainment. It concludes that an environment for investment should be created for enhancing the role of remittance on economic growth.

It is influenced by various factors including the situation of water, sanitation and hygiene and water, sanitation and hygiene practices. For travelers, poor water, sanitation and hygiene provisions are considered risk factors for different food and water-borne diseases. This study aims to describe the perceptions of international travelers regarding their experiences on WASH facilities or practices, and how it influences their health, and travel experiences.Methods: This is a cross-sectional pilot study conducted among 150 international travelers in Nepal. The travelers were selected conveniently from the Kathmandu valley. The data on different water, sanitation and hygiene related variables, travelers' health and travel experiences were collected using semi-structured questionnaire. The quantitative data was entered into SPSS for descriptive analysis and qualitative data was transcribed through thematic analysis.Results: Of 150 international travelers, about 2/3rd of the travelers had inadequate perception of water, sanitation and hygiene condition. Nearly 23% of them experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea in the past week during their visit. Among those travelers who experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, 21.4% of them reported of their travel plans being affected.Conclusions: Perception and experience with water, sanitation and hygiene facilities was found inadequate among international travelers visiting Nepal. Such facilities seem to have affected the travelers' health (nearly a quarter of them experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea) and their travel plan.

The study also analyses the importance of scaling up the share of solar energy to contribute to the country's overall energy generation mix. The technical viability of the designed PV system is assessed using PVsyst and Meteonorm simulation software. The performance indicators adopted in our study are the electric energy output, performance ratio, and the economic returns including the levelised cost and the net present value of energy production. The key parameters used in simulations are site-specific meteorological data, solar irradiance, PV capacity factor, and the price of electricity. The achieved PV system efficiency and the performance ratio are 17% and 84%, respectively. The demand–supply gap has been estimated assuming the load profile of a typical household in Kathmandu under the enhanced use of electric appliances. Our results show that the 3-kWp PV system can generate 100% of electricity consumed by a typical residential household in Kathmandu. The calculated levelised cost of energy for the PV system considered is 0.06 $/kWh, and the corresponding rate of investment is 87%. The payback period is estimated to be 8.6 years.

Higher concentrations and positive strong correlations of Na+ with K+, NH4+-N, Cl−, HCO3−, and PO4−-P, and a change of water type from Ca-HCO3 during the wet season to Na-K-HCO3 during the dry season indicate higher contamination in river water during the dry season.

Inadequate water supplies tend to generate environmental and health issues. Improvements in water supply systems should give priority to the region with the most severe mismatch between water supply and demand. To set priorities for the improvement of water supply systems, this study proposed a water supply-demand balance model to quantify the water supply-demand gap in the Koshi River basin and compared it with the traditional water vulnerability model. The results suggested that (1) the water supply-demand balance model had good applicability to the Koshi River basin and was superior to traditional models in identifying the region with the most severe mismatch; (2) the shortage of agricultural water was much more serious than that of domestic water in the basin; (3) the largest supply-demand gap of domestic water was in Tarai and that of agricultural water was in the hill areas; and (4) Four districts, including Lalitpur, Mahottari, Makwanpur, and Solukhumbu, were found to be the most water-stressed regions and priority should be given to them. Based on these findings, the priority setting in the improvement of water supply systems and adaptation strategies for mitigating water stress from the perspectives of the government, communities, and households were presented.

This study used meteorological and household level data which were collected from three different districts (Kavrepalanchowk, Sindhuli, and Saptari) in the Koshi River Basin of Nepal to conduct a drought vulnerability analysis. We developed a model for assessing drought vulnerability of rural households based on three critical components, i.e., exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The results revealed that Saptari (drought vulnerability index, 0.053) showed greater vulnerability to drought disasters than Kavrepalanchowk (0.014) and Sindhuli (0.007). The most vulnerable district (Saptari) showed the highest exposure, the highest sensitivity, and the highest adaptive capacity. Kavrepalanchowk had the middle drought vulnerability index with middle exposure, low sensitivity, and middle adaptive capacity.

The study is based on reviewing and analyzing the documents relating to the defined objectives and targets, investment policies, investment portfolio, legal framework for investment, and achievements. The study finds that all three social security institutions (SSIs) end up investing the accumulated funds in fixed deposits in the banking and financial institutions (BFIs.). This is despite the act empowering them to mobilize the accumulated funds in several productive sectors and set competitive investment goals. This indicates that they fail to explore productive avenues for sustainable investment of the accumulated funds, which could contribute to the economic development of the nation. The current challenges in the social security system in Nepal are the increasing number of pensioners and the need for sustainable investment; making it imperative for the Nepalese SSIs to evaluate their investment priority; feasibility and diversify for higher and long-term returns; focusing on areas that contribute to economic growth and development; and generating employment opportunities.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/68022/52144,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

While substantial hydro investments are in the pipeline; a strong, diverse hydro-mechanical manufacturing industry is established. But the electro-mechanical industry is non-existent. Policies have attracted substantial private investment in hydropower sector, but it is not geared towards the use of electricity for overall economic development of Nepal and has yet to streamline policy with respect to lean season augmented flow of water for drinking and irrigation purposes within and outside Nepal.

In BPKIHS, junior resident doctors are one of the frontline health care professionals and are vulnerable to mental health problems. This study was undertaken to find out depression, anxiety, and stress in the frontline junior resident doctors (FJRD). METHODOLOGY A web-based cross-sectional study among FJRD was done from 29 August to 28 September 2020 using Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULT Among 168 FJRD, 144(85.7%) responded, and the mean age was 29.6±1.9 years. They were mostly male (56.9%), unmarried (60. 4%), living alone (77.1%), first-year junior residents (43.1%), and had last duty more than 2 weeks(56.9%). Anxiety was seen in 50%; followed by Depression in 38.1%; and Stress in 27.7%. The moderate type of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress was common which were 19.6%, 24.3% and 15.2% respectively. Depression, Anxiety and Stress was more in male (55 to 61.1%), unmarried (60-64%), living alone (76-85%) and first-year residents (37.5-43.6%) but not statistically significant. Depression, Anxiety and Stress were more in those whose last duty more than 2 weeks but statistically significant with Anxiety (p=0.03) only.

The spatial distribution of species collected for medicine showed that all habitats were important for collection however, habitats close to villages were more favored. The use of non-indigenous and easily available species and more accessible habitats is becoming more prevalent as primary forests become increasingly overexploited, indigenous species become limited, and sociocultural cause of land use change expand.

Soil erosion is an ongoing geomorphic process for which rainfall is one of the active drivers. The significant effect of CC on the soil erosion process is the change in the erosive power of rainfall due to variations in rainfall patterns, amounts, and intensities. The study assesses rainfall erosivity of revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) historical time (1961-1990), mid future (50s: 2041-2060) and far future (70s: 2061-2080). Ensembles of ten selected General Circulation Models (GCMs) from WorldClim under two representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) were used for projected analysis. Wischmeier and Smith, (1978)’s approach was used to estimate rainfall erosivity. This study provides an overview of changes in rainfall erosivity (past and projections) and discusses the potential impacts on soil erosion across the country. The rates of change in precipitation and resulting rainfall erosivity are relatively more under RCP 8.5 than RCP 4.5. During 70s, annual precipitation is projected to increase by 8.1 % under RCP 8.5. We found that the annual rainfall erosivities are expected to increase by 27.8% in high mountain, 17.76 % in upper hill, 17.7% in mid hill, 19.68% in siwalik, and 16.5% in tarai plain of the country in far future under RCP 8.5 with respect to historical time. Our study suggests the scenario of CC in the future will increase soil erosion based on just the effects of the rainfall erosivity factor. Pandey 2015; Uddin , 2016) on the estimation of soil erosion at a small scale have been conducted for different regions of Nepal and very few studies (Koirala et al. , 2019; Uddin et al. , 2018) at a national scale. However, assessment of CC impacts on soil erosion is still lacking. Quantifying the effects of past and future rainfall-induced soil loss is essential in identifying the susceptible areas prone to erosion under CC. The present study aims to estimate future rainfall erosivity under the influence of CC at the national scale (nationwide analysis of Nepal). The outcomes of this study are expected to be useful to policymakers for effective land use planning and soil conservation. ranging from 150 – 2000 MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 . Some regional studies carried out inside the country showed different values of annual rainfall erosivity; Pandey et al., (2015) computed annual rainfall erosivity based on satellite-based rainfall where annual rainfall erosivity ranges from 1000 – 5000 MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 in western Nepal. Chalise et al., (2018) estimated annual rainfall erosivity to be about 400 MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 in a small watershed in western mid-hill of the country. Ban et al., (2016) estimated R-factor to be about 700 MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 in a small watershed located near to the capital city of the country. This study assesses the country averaged mean annual rainfall erosivity for historical time period to be 3071.3 MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 with a high standard deviation of 2243.9 MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 varying from a minimum of 114.9 MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 to maximum of 20800.9 MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 . The physiographical averaged mean annual rainfall erosivities for historical time period (under RCP 8.5 for 70s) are 569.2 (727.4) MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 for HM, 2511.3 (2957.5) MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 for UH, 4061.3 (4780.3) MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 for MH, 4730.4 (5661.7) MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 for SW, and 4730.5 (5513.9) MJ mm ha -1 h -1 yr -1 for TP.

Our findings reveal that there is currently large spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality across the landscape as a result of current anthropogenic threats, and that three areas in particular could have up to 40% reduction in habitat quality as a result of the planned infrastructure. Further research is required to determine more precisely the impact on key species.

Green Revolution technologies and the package of practices largely ignored the role of ecosystem services, leaving a large population of small farmers’ food- and nutrition-insecure. Biodiversity, especially, agrobiodiversity is in decline and this vital cross-cutting element is less discussed and interlinked in nexus literature. The interlinking food system with water–energy–biodiversity nexus, therefore, is essential to achieve a resilient food system. It ensures the vital structures and functions of the ecosystem on which it is dependent are well protected in the face of increasing socio-economic and climatic stress. This paper reviews the food system of Nepal through the lens of the food–water–energy–biodiversity (FWEB) nexus to develop a more robust food system framework. From this approach, food system foresight can benefit from different nature-based solutions such as agro-ecosystem-based adaptation and mitigation and climate-resilient agro-ecological production system. We found that the FWEB nexus-based approach is more relevant in the context of Nepal where food and nutrition insecurity prevails among almost half of the population. Improvement in the food system requires the building of synergy and complementary among the components of FWEB nexus. Hence, we proposed a modified framework of food system foresight for developing resilience in a food system, which can be achieved with an integrated and resilient nexus that gives more emphasis to agro-ecological system-based solutions to make the food system more climate resilient. This framework can be useful in addressing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, and 15 and can also be used as a tool for food system planning based on a broader nexus.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/10/8/1129/pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

To understand the fluctuations in the arsenic concentration in the tube well of Nepal, water quality and groundwater level of 24 tube wells in Nepal were monitored over 10- month and 3-year periods. The results revealed large fluctuations in the arsenic concentration in the tube well water. The minimum and maximum arsenic concentrations in the tube well water were 5 and 1,828 µg/L, and the minimum and maximum fluctuations in arsenic concentration in the water of each tube well were 231 and 1,463 µg/L (146 times of WHO guideline value), respectively. These fluctuations in arsenic concentration were less related to rainfall patterns, but were closely related to the periods of groundwater irrigation for paddy and wheat cultivation, which occurred twice a year, around May and November. The abrupt decline in the groundwater level coincided with the timing of groundwater irrigation. The arsenic concentration increased by 1252 µg/L in a tube well over a one-month period when the groundwater level dropped by 1 m within one week. Thus, along with low groundwater levels, rapid fluctuations in the groundwater table might be related to the increase in the arsenic concentration. Based on these results, we propose that arsenic concentrations and groundwater levels in multiple tube wells should be observed continuously, and the relationship between arsenic fluctuation and groundwater irrigation should be investigated further.",,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

This project adopted two approaches to establish a standardized capacity development process for small-town water supplies. The first approach, the Management Model, consists of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and business planning. The second approach, termed the Support Model, entails a comprehensive system for training, monitoring, and evaluating water supply management. Throughout the project, a total of 31 SOPs pertaining to operation, maintenance, and facility rehabilitation manuals were developed. Moreover, four courses consisting of training, basic and on-site training, and interactive workshops were conducted. Consequently, the data deficiency rate reduced significantly by 61%, while 87% of water samples met water quality standards. In contrast, the operating ratio and water production rates improved by 17 and 29%, respectively. The materials produced from these models are expected to contribute to small-town water supply systems beyond the pilot sites. This is due to the versatility of the model for future applications. Although the project was effectively implemented, continuous support for small-town water supply by the Government of Nepal is needed for future sustainability.",https://iwaponline.com/washdev/article-pdf/14/6/466/1438613/washdev0140466.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

However, studies on the microbial analysis of water and vegetable samples from this region are limited. In this study, irrigation water and vegetable samples from farmers' fields in the Kathmandu Valley were examined for the presence of Escherichia coli and total coliforms. Methods: Irrigation water (n = 8) and vegetable (n = 27) samples were collected from November to December 2015. The presence of E. coli and total coliforms in water and on vegetable surfaces was determined by the most probable number (MPN) method using Colilert reagent. In addition, information about vegetable washing and consumption was obtained through a survey to discuss changes in their microbial concentrations before selling and/or consumption. Results: E. coli was detected in 75% (6/8) of the water samples, with concentrations ranging from 8.8 * 10 ^ 3 to 5.2×107 MPN/100 ml, whereas total coliforms were detected in all the 8 water samples, with concentrations ranging from 9.7 * 10 ^ 2 | 7.9 * 10 ^ 7 * MPN / 100 * m . E. coli was similarly detected in 7% (2/27) of the vegetable samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 10.2 MPN/cm², whereas total coliforms were detected in 59% (16/27) of the vegetable samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 448 MPN/cm².

Similarly, the Mahakali III Irrigation Project from the Tanakpur Barrage and amulti-lane motorable bridge over Mahakali River were also identified as projects to be funded through the Indian line of credit. This article examines the background of these three projects (Budhi Gandaki, Mahakali III, and bridge over Mahakali) and questions whether they were truly born in Singha Durbar, or further away in Delhi.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/hn.v16i0.12211HYDRO Nepal  Journal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue No: 16 January, 2015Page: 1-6Uploaded date: March 1, 2015 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/12211/9901,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Among them, six springs were tested for chemical parameters. The results show that the distribution of EC and TDS is greater towards the lower elevation i.e. southern part near the settlement and agricultural land with the value ranging from 13 – 219 µS/cm and 7.08 – 161 mg/l respectively. The distribution of pH is inconsistent with the elevation and ranges from 2.27 – 6.66 throughout the area. The distribution of DO is greater at the central region and towards the lower elevation with the value ranging from 2.77 – 6.33 mg/l. The temperature ranges from 12.4 – 22.8 oC and increases with a decrease in the elevation. All the physiochemical parameters, except for pH, lies within the permissible range given by National Drinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS, 2005) and World Health Organization (WHO) (2004) standards.

Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) is a holistic management approach, integrating land water interaction, socio economic groups, upstream downstream relations, indigenous knowledge, and institutions built up, along the temporal dimensions based on an agreed set of principles. It is a bottom-up decentralized approach for the management of water resources. IWRM is a challenge to conventional practices, attitudes and professional certainties. It confronts entrenched sectoral interest & requires that the water resources are managed holistically for the benefits of all.The broad objective of the multidisciplinary study was to assess the possibilities of Human Dimensions of water resource development and its management. Water resource accounting is done by the collection of water resources data through participatory group formation.  Scientific data of hydro and metrological stations was also acquired. Hydrological modeling tools were also used. Feasibility of hydropower plant and potential of power production in the basin was readily estimated.Total daily discharge of the Durlung Watershed was estimated on an average of 157 Million Liters. Rivers of the watershed are turbulent, unsteady & flowing with very high current, which can be utilized by local people for low cost drinking water, tourism, irrigation & hydropower generation. Micro-hydropower production possibilities in Ratan and Deuta rivers have shown multidimensional positive impacts on socio-economic development of the region. Level of community partnership in IWRM and synchronization with the local, district & national level institutional framework for Basin Management was observed to be satisfactory. Participatory research was carried to identify water resource base with school & community partnership. Community motives, their difficulties and gaps in community level organization were identified. For capabilities of community to take over the responsibilities of IWRM concept, there is a lot more need of training and capacity building for now. HYDRO Nepal Journal of Water Energy and EnvironmentVolume- 18, 2016, JanuaryPage -47 to 54",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/14645/11871,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

This unique faunal wealth is under immense pressure due to habitat modification and climate change. Concrete conservation measures are impeded due to the lack of information on distribution patterns, ecology, and functional biology of a large proportion of species in the region. In this study, we review various published literature from the Himalayan region of India, Nepal, and Bhutan to document the species and genera richness of butterflies. We further categorize butterflies into different subgroups based on their larval diet breadth, biogeographic affinity, and conservation priority. We then determine the elevational distribution pattern of the overall community and the subgroups. Lastly, we assess threats and discuss conservation approaches adopted to safeguard butterflies in the region. We document a total of 1096 species and 348 genera belonging to 33 subfamilies and six families of butterflies that have their distributional range in the Himalayan region. Among these, 311 species representing 28.37% are of high conservation concern. The species richness of butterflies is comparatively higher in the Central and Eastern Himalaya than in the Western Himalaya. The species richness of the overall butterfly community and most of the subgroups declines monotonically along the elevational gradient. Butterflies species composition shows high turnover with increasing elevation. The lower elevation consists of more number of Oriental and conservation concern species, while the higher elevation is characterized by Palearctic species. Assessment of threat shows that more butterflies are threatened in the lower elevation due to habitat modification while climate change may affect species across the landscape. Butterflies, unlike most of the higher faunal taxa, receive comparatively less conservation attention. The conservation measures implemented at present are inadequate to conserve butterflies. New approaches that take into account both the conservation of butterflies and socioeconomic interest of local communities are essential in the region.",,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Focusing on functional place dependence, it analyses place attachment within the Panipokhari Integrated Settlement, designed for the Thami community in Dolakha district. Using ""residential satisfaction"" as a parameter to measure the influencing factors of place dependence, data were collected through a Likert scale survey, interviews, and observations. The analysis encompassed Cronbach's Alpha for reliability (α = 0.825), mean satisfaction scores for evaluation, and Spearman’s rank correlation to explore relationships between residential satisfaction parameters and place dependence factors. The study revealed significant correlations, highlighting varied influences on place attachment. Notably, social connectivity, represented by nearness to relatives (r = 0.720, p = 0.000), exhibited a strong positive correlation. Similarly, infrastructure amenities like electricity (r = 0.532, p = 0.000) displayed a relatively strong positive correlation, while access to health facilities (r = 0.447, p = 0.002) demonstrated a moderate positive correlation. Moreover, settlement planning components—kitchen gardens (r = 0.623, p = 0.000), open spaces (r = 0.578, p = 0.000), settlement layout (r = 0.549, p = 0.000), and cattle sheds (r = 0.574, p = 0.000)—significantly correlated with increased attachment. Additionally, housing design factors like immediate exterior spaces (r = 0.730, p = 0.000), spaces for life cycle rituals (r = 0.771, p = 0.000), and social events (r = 0.663, p = 0.000) and building performance factor winter thermal comfort (r = 0.606, p = 0.000)displayed substantial positive correlations. Acknowledging study limitations, it offers insights for planners and policymakers, stressing holistic approaches for sustainable resettlement. Future research should explore diverse factors and contexts, emphasizing the dynamic nature of place dependence.

Nepal’s policy framers of 10,000 MW in 10 years crusade have totally failed to see the larger picture in the Ganges basin.

Electricity attained the upper class status with Water downgraded to Dalit class!India’s greatest burning problem in the Ganges basin, that supports nearly fifty per cent of her 1,200 million people, is WATER. India, therefore, is in desperate need of storages in Nepal to realize her master plan, the Interlinking of Rivers. With Nepal in desperate pursuit of hydroelectricity, India sees this as an opportune moment to avail GRATIS stored WATER through Nepal’s default. According to Bhim Subba, a Bhutanese of Nepalese origin, this is the fundamental flaw in all past Indo-Nepal deals. Subba believes India must concede that success of her Ganges water strategy hinges entirely on Nepal. He argues that water stored in Nepal has monetary value and this must be factored in all storage projects. Such a policy would be mutually beneficial for both the countries.

Here, we elucidate the impacts of the climate crisis on irrigation water availability and cropping area in Nepal’s largest irrigation scheme, the Sunsari Morang Irrigation Scheme (SMIS), by accounting for the hydraulic capacity of existing canal systems, and potential changes realised under future climates. To capture variability implicit in climate change projections, we invoke multiple Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs; 4.5 and 8.5) across three time horizons (2016–2045, 2036–2065, and 2071–2100). We reveal that although climate change increases water availability to agriculture from December through March, the designed discharge of 60 m3/s would not be available in February-March for both RCPs under all three time horizons. Weed growth, silt deposition, and poor maintenance have reduced the current canal capacity from the design capacity of 60 m3/s to 53 m3/s up to 10.7 km from the canal intake (representing a 12% reduction in the discharge capacity of the canal). Canal flow is further reduced to 35 m3/s at 13.8 km from canal intake, representing a 27% reduction in flow capacity relative to the original design standards. Based on climate projections, and assuming ceteris paribus irrigation infrastructure, total wheat cropping area could increase by 12–19%, 23–27%, and 12–35% by 2016–2045, 2036–2065, and 2071–2100, respectively, due to increased water availability borne by the changing climate. The case for further investment in irrigation infrastructure via water diversion, or installation of efficient pumps at irrigation canal intakes is compelling. Such investment would catalyse a step-change in the agricultural economy that is urgently needed to sustain the Nepalese economy, and thus evoke beneficial cascading implications for global food security.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/16/18/2595/pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Actual yields were less than 50% of the potential yields. Projected irrigation water demand is likely to increase for RCP4.5 (3%) but likely to decrease under RCP8.5 (8%) due to the truncated crop duration and lower maturity biomass by the end of the 21st century. However, simulated yields declined by 20%, suggesting that even irrigation will not be enough to mitigate the severe and detrimental effects of climate change on crop production.

Based on data availability, relevance to the study area and review of literatures, 12 indicators were selected under five key components outlined by WPI. The study result shows medium-low degree (WPI = 54.4) of water poverty in the Koshi River Basin in Nepal. The WPI score varies widely (from 49.75 to 69.29) along the districts and it was found that districts in Tarai regions and urban areas were more water stressed compared to the districts in mid-hill and high-hill regions.

Despite theoretical pertinence, questions remain about the effective implementation due to limited studies on key aspects of sustainability, such as water supply and demand, pollution, and impacts of climate change and socio-economic growth. This study analyses the current and future availability of water under climate change scenarios and determines water resources carrying capacity (WRCC) as the maximum socio-economic growth that can be supported in a case study on the Kaski District, Nepal. Annual average water availability was estimated to be 11,030.7 million cubic meters (MCM) for the baseline period (1992–2010), and 7,677.4 and 7,674.2 MCM for the future period (2022–2050) under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios, respectively. For the baseline period, WRCC far exceeds the current population; therefore, water resources will not be a limiting factor for local socio-economic development. Nevertheless, sustainable water infrastructure development policies are necessary to ensure a reliable water supply able to cope with increasing seasonal variability and declining future water availability. A total of 30,049 tons of biological oxygen demand (BOD) loads were estimated based on the economic activities of the Kaski District in 2011, with the direct and indirect sectoral roles of water pollution determined for the first time. Rather than a single pollution control strategy based on pollution loads, multiple sector-specific strategies are necessary to effectively implement water pollution control policies.",https://iwaponline.com/jwcc/article-pdf/13/8/3030/1093912/jwc0133030.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The country’s population density is increasing along with rapid growth of population especially over mountainous cities, southern hills and the Terai. On the other hand, a number of fatal natural calamities, such as flash flooding and landslides raised by clutter intensive rainfall, have been increasing since the last decade. To deal with such water hydro meteorological disasters, accurate information on spatial and temporal variation of rainfall distribution is very important. In Nepal, the amount of rainfall has been obtained from limited rain gauge networks, which may leads to many errors in making a Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE). Weather radar observations have recently been highlighted as an alternative option for estimating the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation across specified time intervals. However, estimating rainfall from radar observation has its own challenges, especially over a mountainous country like Nepal.Another mountainous country Japan is well known for using weather radar observation to make QPE product. Different types of weather radar have been used to record, monitor and forecast precipitation in Japan for both operational and research purposes. A high level research work has also been done on this field. The high spatial and temporal (250-m and 1-min) QPE product obtained from the radar observation is available for the public. It shows good harmony with ground data in the flat and mountain areas of Japan. Though Nepal and Japan are located in different regions, both countries represent complex mountain regions and have been facing natural disaster caused by extreme rainfall. In Nepal, weather radar observation for estimating precipitation amounts has not started on an operational basis till date. Hence, sharing knowledge and skills from Japan’s research on weather radar observation would play a key role to achieve the radar based QPE product in Nepal. Therefore, we discuss about the challenge in obtaining QPE product, considering an example of the progress of weather radar system in Japan. It is believed that any discussion on it will be a reference for weather radar deployment and its QPE product in Nepal in coming days.  HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 21, July, 2017Page: 50-59Upload Date: July 18, 2017",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/17822/14468,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The questionnaire was subjected to farmers’ CBAs for integrated FWRM and multiple structural and nonstructural adaptation measures for irrigation and rivers. The results showed that farmer participation varied across community groups. To understand the most important associated factors within community diversity and household attributes to adopt different water resources, the most adopted structural measures of water flow management (54%) from irrigation and buffer zone vegetation (54%) from rivers were analyzed.

Therefore, we assessed the performance and maintenance of five HWTS methods used in 101 households. The choice of HWTS methods by households was primarily influenced by the raw water source, that is, jarred water users opted for boiling and groundwater users selected reverse osmosis with ultraviolet irradiation (RO-UV). While boiling and electric dispensers (ED) did not remove inorganic contaminants (ammonia nitrogen, arsenic, and manganese), ceramic candle filters (CCF) and RO-UV reduced them moderately. The HWTS methods reduced E. coli and total coliforms (TC) by 95.8 and 84.1%, respectively, but 11.8 and 69.3% of treated water samples remained positive for these two bacteria. Combined methods (CM) and RO-UV showed an inferior TC reduction compared to the simpler HWTS methods, boiling, CCF, and ED, possibly due to difficulties with regular maintenance and storage contamination. Therefore, it is recommended to choose simpler HWTS methods that meet the requirements of the household’s water sources rather than more expensive and difficult-to-maintain methods, which should be chosen only if the raw water contains high concentrations of inorganic contaminants.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/15/12/2305/pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

It pre-dominantly resides in Buffer Zone of Langtang National Park, located in north-central Nepal. The Buffer zones is areas of settlements and agriculture surrounding the core area set aside for wildlife habitats and rare flora. Access on buffer zone programs depends greatly on their representation on local institutions. There are three tiers of local institutions viz. Syaubari Buffer Zone Community Forest User&rsquo;s Group (SBZCFUG), Laharepauwa Buffer Zone User&rsquo;s Committee (LBZUC) and Buffer Zone Cooperative (BZC). 13.8% households represented in SBZCFUG. Likewise, 5.2 and 2.1% households represented in LBZUC and BZC, respectively. As per Buffer Zone Management Directives (1999), LBZUC is the most important institution among all as it distributes the revenues to buffer zone communities. The Park office prepares a Forest Operational Plan (FOP) and hands over a patch of community forest to a buffer zone community. The FOP outlines harvestable quantity of forest resources, harvesting blocks, price and prescribed forestry works. 84% households were involved in FOP preparation. In return for revenue sharing, the park office expects in-kind (labour) contribution from community in biodiversity conservation. 17% respondents said that the park office highly emphasized local consultation for fixing price of forest resources. 32% said that park&rsquo;s emphasis was fine while 50% were not aware. The half of respondents having no idea of consultation was a big gap. Yearly in-kind contribution of a household for biodiversity conservation was nearly 2 days. The share of forest committee meeting was the highest (58%). Despite park&rsquo;s much talked focus on people&rsquo;s participation, reality is bleak. The study recommends that that contribution should be increased and be more focused on fighting forest fire, plantation, creating water holes for wild animals, non timber forest products (NTFPs) utilization, fire line construction etc. No significant relation was found between in-kind contribution with income level, education and landholding.

The research is conducted in Sunil Smirti Gaupalika (Rural Municipality) of Rolpa district and focuses on the role of institutions in order to transform particularly the economic life of the people. The research divides institutions into two parts. The first one includes the governmental local institution Gaupalika. The second part includes INGO/NGOs. This division enables to decipher and historicize what these government and non government institutions have done independently and collectively to uplift the life of target group. The research finds that INGO/NGOs and locals institution in the remote village like Sunil Smirti Gaupalika have played significant roles on uniting the economically poor and make individual and collective efforts to fight against poverty. They work to find out the poor and economically weak section of the society by setting target group, generating the awareness and providing conductive environment for putting collective effort in their fight against poverty to a certain extent. Therefore, these two types of institutions have been found tremendously supportive in uniting what Marx calls “have-nots” of Sunil Smirti Gaupalika.

Results suggest that among the trees, the community forest was dominated by a single species, Shorea robusta. However, Shorea robusta and Terminalia myriocarpa were codominant in the government forest. Tree density and basal area were higher in the government forest, but shrub/sapling density and basal area were higher in the community forest, suggesting a positive effect of community management on tree regeneration. Overstory species assemblages showed an obvious compositional difference between the forests, but understory species assemblages were less obvious. Plot-level tree and shrub/sapling species richness was higher in the government forest than the community forest. However, seedling-herbaceous species richness was higher in the community forest. The dominance of Shorea robusta trees in the community forest suggests that people involved in managing forests may be more interested in a limited number of economically valuable species while removing less important trees. Such preferential management practices may increase resource heterogeneity within a forest and maintain species diversity in the understory. Thus, community participation in forest management should be encouraged, with guided management techniques and exercises, to achieve maximum forest recovery, provide sustainable ecosystem services, and maintain forest diversity.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10549811.2015.1036298,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Secondary data sources included existing literature on landless housing reconstruction and community-based initiatives. The findings reveal that the landless communities suffered greatly due to seismically vulnerable structures, lack of preparedness, and insufficient use of critical seismic features. These communities often lack access to vital information that could mitigate disaster risks. The study further explores how residents have innovatively rebuilt their homes by integrating safety measures, utilizing salvaged materials, and combining traditional knowledge with scientifically validated techniques.

Leasehold forests, which contribute greatly to reviving degraded forests and livelihoods of pro-poor communities, however, have been sidelined from such studies. This study assessed the biomass carbon stock of leasehold forests and its relationship with tree diversity in the Nawalpur district in Nepal. The concentric sample plots with subplots were laid, measuring trees (8.92m radius), saplings (5.64m radius), and regeneration (1m radius), in eleven leasehold forests. Plant diversity was calculated using the Shannon–Wiener diversity index (H’) to assess forest conditions. The average carbon stock was found to be 11.40 t/ha, where the stock varied by nature of intervention. The average carbon stock in non-tree-based restoration sites was estimated to be 3.81 t/ha, which was significantly lower than in tree-based restoration sites (14.49 t/ha). A total of 37 species of trees were recorded from 45 sample plots distributed across eleven LFUGs. Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficient between forest carbon stock and diversity index was 0.613, which shows a strong positive correlation and was significant at a 99% confidence interval. There was a synergy between biomass carbon stock and tree diversity because communities were protecting the existing tree species and planting multipurpose trees to meet their need for forest products.

Urban centres in the HKH have been defined based on different criteria, but mountain-specific criteria are lacking. In the mountains, small settlements such as district headquarters perform a large number of functions, typical of an urban centre. However, they are not formally classified as urban centres because they do not meet the census-defined nationally set criteria of the respective country. Nonetheless, water insecurity is a reality, attributed to: (i) water governance issues; (ii) inappropriate urban planning, failing, and to some extent, unable to account for the floating population, such as tourists; and (iii) the scourge of climate change which could worsen the situation further. Short-term coping strategies to meeting water demands often involve unsustainable solutions, such as groundwater extraction, with long-term repercussions. However, long-term strategies for water sustainability by the governments have been beneficial while others are yet to show success.

Four species viz. Eichornia, Parthenium, Pistia and Ipomoea were selected and the chemical was screened using aqueous methanol as selective menstruum through cold percolation. The fractionated extracts showed the presence of some phytochemicals including alkaloids, saponins, carbohydrates and steroids. Pistia was screening positively for alkaloids, carbohydrates, flavonoids, saponin and steroid; Parthenium for alkaloids, flavonoids and steroids; Eichornia for alkaloids and carbohydrates whereas Ipomoea showed the presence of alkaloids only. The extracts were also screened for antibacterial and antifungal activities. The leaf extracts were used to assess antimicrobial activities against bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Salmonella typhimurium, and fungi: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Alternaria solani and Fusarium solani using the well diffusion method. The results indicated that the leaf extracts of Parthenium exhibited more zone of inhibition against all bacteria and has potential to be used as anti-bacterial agent.

Studies show that despite being a major stakeholder, women's voices are often absent in water management decisions. One of the effective ways of creating genderinclusive and empowering water management systems is through government policies and strategies. The objective of this paper is to examine whether Nepal's water‐related policies are gender inclusive and empowering. We review Nepal's major water‐related policies—the constitution and various acts and regulations—to assess whether these documents reflect women's interests and representation in various institutions that provide rights and controls over water in communities. Based on the review, we find that recent water policies of Nepal increasingly recognize the role of women as major stakeholders. This recognition is reflected in Nepal's policies such as the requirement to have at least 33% women represented in water user associations and the inclusion of women in executive positions at the community level. However, because of the lack of other strong implementation and monitoring arrangements such as allocation of budget and capacity‐building provisions, these policies are limited in their capacity to empower women to play decision‐making roles in water management. For women to have meaningful participation in water management, it is important that Nepal initiates provisions such as a strong implementation plan, adequate budget allocation for women's capacity building, and frequent monitoring. 尼泊尔妇女是家庭内外用水的主要使用者。研究表明, 尽管妇女是主要的利益攸关方, 但在水管理决策中却常常缺少妇女的声音。创建性别包容和赋权的水管理系统的有效方法之一是通过政府政策和战略。本文旨在研究尼泊尔与水有关的政策是否具有性别包容性和赋权性。我们述评了尼泊尔与水有关的主要政策——宪法以及各种法案和法规——以评估这些文件是否反映了妇女在“提供社区水权和控制权的不同机构”中的利益和代表性。根据述评, 我们发现, 尼泊尔近期的水政策越来越认可妇女作为主要利益攸关方的作用。这种认可反映在尼泊尔的政策中, 例如要求用水者协会至少有33%的妇女代表, 以及让妇女担任社区一级的行政职务。然而, 由于缺乏其他强有力的实施和监督安排, 例如预算分配和能力建设规定, 这些政策在“对妇女赋权, 使其在水管理方面发挥决策作用”的能力有限。为了使妇女有意义地参与水管理, 尼泊尔需要启动“强有力的实施计划、为妇女能力建设分配充足的预算、以及经常监测”等规定。.

The economic viability of the system was assessed based on solar radiation data of different Nepalese geographic locations. The mechanical power produced by the solar ORC is coupled with a water pumping system for various applications, such as drinking and irrigation. The thermal efficiency of the system was found to be 8% with an operating temperature of 120 °C. The hot water produced by the unit has a temperature of 40 °C. Economic assessment was done for 1-kW and 5-kW solar ORC water pumping systems. These systems use different types of solar collectors: a parabolic trough collector (PTC) and an evacuated tube collector (ETC). The economic analysis showed that the costs of water are $2.47/m3 (highest) and $1.86/m3 (lowest) for the 1-kW system and a 150-m pumping head. In addition, the cost of water is reduced when the size of the system is increased and the pumping head is reduced. The minimum volumes of water pumped are 2190 m3 and 11,100 m3 yearly for 1 kW and 5 kW, respectively. The payback period is eight years with a profitability index of 1.6.

The indexing enables the motivated policy actor to produce well-crafted and feasible recommendations to reform policies. When we trialled MDI-GWP on 16 of Nepal’s federal water-related policies and acts, the multi-dimensional index tracked gender policy developments over the past 30 years, identified areas where policymakers could further consider gender, and revealed differences in gender application between sectors. We included water resources management (WRM), agriculture, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sectors. In Nepal’s case, agriculture and WASH policies are on an improving trajectory for gender equity, while WRM policy has rebounded to the gender blind.

This comprehensive study rigorously examines the physicochemical and biological attributes that define water quality within the watershed. Recognizing the global importance of water quality for human well-being, this investigation specifically evaluates the suitability of water for drinking purposes. Twenty-three samples were collected and subjected to analysis for the twenty-one distinct physicochemical parameters. The analysis covers physicochemical parameters such as pH, water temperature, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity as well as concentrations of ions such as calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), sulfate (SO42-), and phosphate (PO43-), free carbon dioxide (CO2), chloride (Cl-), total hardness (TH), calcium hardness (CaH), magnesium hardness (MgH), iron (Fe2+), turbidity (Turb.) Simultaneously, biological markers including total coliforms were assessed.

Microbial presence, likely a result of increasing anthropogenic pressures, is relatively elevated in most samples. Furthermore, the cumulative outcome reveals a Water Quality Index (WQI) of 22.04, indicating excellent suitability for drinking.

To fill this gap in knowledge, we studied the spatial variation of the precipitation and its impact on water balance in a small headwater basin located in the foothills of the Himalaya, Nepal. We deployed ten rain gauges and climate stations, spanning the whole elevation range 700–4500 m above sea level (masl) for a period of four years. Our results show a quadratic polynomial relationship between annual precipitation and station elevation, which are used to produce annual precipitation maps. The performance of the elevation-based precipitation estimates is adequate in closing the water balance while the performances of average precipitation and Thiessen polygon method are poor and inconsistent in closing the water balance. We also demonstrate that precipitation estimates from one or two gauges at the lowest basin elevation substantially underestimate the water balance.

This paper focuses on assessment of the extent of injury caused by wildlife attacks on humans in the vicinity of the Chitwan National Park (CNP) of Nepal for a period between 2003 and 2013. In the vicinity of this park, people suffer from the attacks by various wild animals such as rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis), tiger (Panthera tigris), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), elephant (Elephas maximus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa). We used data collected from group discussion (n=33), key stakeholder interview (n=36), field observation, and household questionnaire survey (n=329). Our results showed that wildlife attacks were significantly correlated to site environment, season, victims' gender, age, awareness, and activities. The injury severity significantly correlated to attacking animal species (p<0.0001). Fatal cases occurred on 1-people in-3, and rest suffered with minor to severe injuries. On an average, 30 attacks occurred annually. Most fatalities were caused by elephant attacks (68%) followed by tiger (57%), rhino (29%), bear (4%), and by wild boar attacks (4%). Most fatalities (84%) occurred at incident sites, where some victims had to loss their lives due to delay in rescue. The victims were found facing substantially harsh physical, psychological, and economical problems. Patterns of the attacks were significantly uneven across months (p<0.001). Uneducated persons, fishermen, and collectors of forest resources received more fatal attacks than others. We suggest for creation of awareness among local people about species-specific behaviour of attacking animals. The medical trauma centre should be established in the vicinity of the CNP and existing local medical centres should be upgraded for immediate treatment of the victims.",,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

It is due to declining soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Several studies have been done to restore and improve the soil quality, however conservation agriculture (CA)-based practices of minimum tillage, crop residue retention and appropriate crop rotations has been observed to be promising across the globe. Studies on CA under Nepal’s rainfed farming systems of Terai and hills of Nepal improved the soil quality, increased individual crop and system yields, reduced labor demand and was economically profitable. However, lack of adequate soil moisture during planting in initial seasons, inadequate tillage equipment and weed management options are the key constraints of rainfed farming to be transformed into CA in initial stages. In Nepal, the introduction of animal-drawn direct seeding equipment, management of residues or mulches, mechanical or herbicidal weed management options for small-scale rainfed hill farmers can be of paramount significance in scaling-out of the CA based practices in Nepal. For this, further on-station and on-farm verifications of CA based practices need to be carried out across the various cropping systems and agro[1]ecological regions of the country by Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC), Nepal in collaboration with international CG centers, universities, extension and development institutions.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44723/33659,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

The qualitative data was analysed through narrative and discourse analyses. During the negotiation process, political leaders from both communities were involved in the formation and acceptance of the agreement. The long-term negotiation that started during the 1980s culminated in a series of agreements, the last of which formally introduced cash incentives to the upstream community in 2011. The downstream urban community has been paying NPR one million per annum to the upstream community for their continued role in the sustainable management of the water catchment.

Index methods are mostly used for surface water estimation which separates the water from the background based on a threshold value. Generally, the threshold is a fixed value, but can be challenging in the case of environmental noise, such as shadow, forest, built-up areas, snow, and clouds. One such challenging scene can be found in Nepal where no such evaluation has been done. Taking that in consideration, this study evaluates the performance of the most widely used water indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), and Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) in a Landsat 8 scene of Nepal. The scene, ranging from 60 m to 8848 m, contains various types of water bodies found in Nepal with different forms of environmental noise. The evaluation was conducted based on measures from a confusion matrix derived using validation points. Comparing visually and quantitatively, not a single method was able to extract surface water in the entire scene with better accuracy. Upon selecting optimum thresholds, the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (kappa) was improved, but not satisfactory. NDVI and NDWI showed better results for only pure water pixels, whereas MNDWI and AWEI were unable to reject snow cover and shadows. Combining NDVI with NDWI and AWEI with shadow improved the accuracy but inherited the NDWI and AWEI characteristics. Segmenting the test scene with elevations above and below 665 m, and using NDVI and NDWI for detecting water, resulted in an OA of 0.9638 and kappa of 0.8979.

To this end, the following are examined: annual, daily and hourly temperature variations in the water column, vertical turbidity variations and water level changes and map lake floor sediment properties and lake floor structure using open water side-scan sonar transects. Roughness and hardness maps from sonar returns reveal lake floor substrates ranging from mud, to rocky debris and, in places, bare ice. Heat conduction equations using annual lake bottom temperatures and sediment properties are used to calculate bottom ice melt rates (lake floor deepening) for 0.01 to 1-m debris thicknesses. In areas of rapid deepening, where low mean bottom temperatures prevail, thin debris cover or bare ice is present. This finding is consistent with previously reported localized regions of lake deepening and is useful in predicting future deepening.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/9/5/362/pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

This study examines how the overall water balance of Sunkoshi, Marin, and Bagmati Basins will be altered by implementing the Sunkoshi-Marin Diversion Project (SMDP) to fulfill the unmet demands of the Bagmati Irrigation Project (BIP) in the Bagmati Basin via the Marin Basin in Nepal. The specific objectives are to: i) quantify “too much” and “too little” water peculiar to the study basin based on historical data; ii) evaluate water availability, irrigation water requirement, and deficits with and without SMDP; and iii) provide evidence-based recommendations on the effectiveness of the SMDP considering hydropower generation, irrigation and low- and high-flow conditions. Thirty years of historical daily flow data (two gauging stations) and precipitation data (15 stations) were obtained from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology. Other spatial input data were acquired from relevant authorized sources. Water availability has been estimated using flow at the diversion sites while the irrigation requirements have been calculated based on secondary information. Results show that additional water is not at all required for Marin and Bagmati Basins in the monsoon season. Rather, the diverted water increases the flood hazard. Moreover, the contribution of hydropower from SMDP to the national energy demand is insignificant in the monsoon. However, the SMDP was found to play an important role in meeting the irrigation deficits during the dry season. Its contribution to hydropower production in the lean period is also commendable. However, the proposed irrigation requirement of the BIP cannot be met even after the implementation of the SMDP. More importantly, there is a high probability of the intended diversion flow not being available in the Sunkoshi River (donor) which could have severe consequences downstream. Therefore, additional options for conjunctive use need to be explored.",https://nepjol.info/index.php/scitech/article/download/60466/45178,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Agriculture is the largest global freshwater user, and integration of surface- and ground-water use is frequently presented as an strategy for increasing efficiency as well as climate change adaptation. However, conjunctive management (CM) planning often ignores demand-side requirements and a broader set of sustainable development considerations, including ecosystem health and economics of different development strategies. While there is generic understanding of conjunctive use, detailed technical knowhow to realize the CM is lacking in Nepal. This article presents a holistic framework through literature reviews, stakeholders consultations and expert interviews for assessing CM and implementation prospects from a systems-level perspective. We demonstrate the framework through a case study in Western Nepal, where climatic variability and a lack of irrigation are key impediments to increased agricultural productivity and sustainable development. Results show that knowledge of water resources availability is good and that of water demand low in the Western Terai. Additional and coordinated investments are required to improve knowledge gaps as well as access to irrigation. There is therefore a need to assess water resources availability, water access, use and productivity, to fill the knowledge gaps in order to pave pathways for CM.

This study aimed to describe and test the validity and reliability of a household water insecurity scale, and to assess the impact of household water insecurity on psychological distress among 371 women living in urban Nepal. A household interview survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire. Approximately 70% of the participants experienced collecting less water than they needed. Four domains of household water insecurity emerged from the principal components factor analysis: (i) difficulties in house-work related to water, (ii) lost opportunity costs and social interactions related to water, (iii) an insufficient safe water supply, and (iv) difficulties in basic activities related to water. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the domains of ‘lost opportunity costs and social interactions’, ‘difficulties in house-work’ and ‘difficulties in basic activities’ were associated with psychological distress among women. The impact of household water insecurity on psychological distress differed by water supply service levels. The current household water insecurity scale is a simple instrument which can be used to prioritise the target population for water interventions. Further research should be conducted towards the development of a universally applicable measurement tool.",http://iwaponline.com/wp/article-pdf/17/6/1019/404546/017061019.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Methods: In total, 300 women consented to participate in the study, of which 267 women were able to participate in a follow-up 1 month after discharge. We developed a household water insecurity scale (HWIS; total score range 0–24 points) by adapting the household food insecurity access scale. Results: The Cronbach's coefficient alpha for the HWIS was moderately acceptable. Psychological health was assessed in terms of postnatal depression and physical health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The median score of the HWIS was 8, and more than 60% of the participants answered that they sometimes or often worried about not having enough water, used only small amounts of water, had a lack of hygiene, and had insufficient time for childrearing. Multiple regression models showed that women with high levels of stress derived from household water insecurity had greater odds of probable depression and lower physical HRQOL scores than did women with low HWIS scores. Conclusion: The results suggest that improving water security is necessary to foster maternal psychological health in developing countries.",http://iwaponline.com/jwh/article-pdf/14/2/317/394759/jwh0140317.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

In Nepal only six municipalities i.e. Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Pokhara, Dhankuta, Tansen and Ghorahi practice sanitary landfill for waste management and other municipality practices open dumping which has become major cause of environmental and human health hazards (ADB, 2013).Jeetpur Simara Sub-Metropolitan City (JSSMC) is a recently formed sub-metropolitan city. This city has not performed any study on solid waste management till date and lacks data on quantity and composition of municipal solid waste generation that facilitates effective planning of municipal solid waste management. The household survey revealed an average per capita household waste generation rate of 120 g/capita/day. The total Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation is estimated about 15 tons/day and 5475 tons/year. The analysis of household waste composition indicated that the highest waste category was organic waste with 80% followed by plastics with 10%, paper and paper products with 6% and inert with 4%. The composition analysis of institutional wastes revealed 41% paper and paper products, 33% plastics, 13% organic wastes and 13% inert. The study found that commercial waste comprised 59% paper and paper products, 21% plastics, 17% organic and 3% inert.

In developing countries, solid waste disposal in open dump sites is widely practised as an easy and economical method of waste disposal. The increased quantity and composition of solid waste has posed a serious threat to public health and environment in developing countries. Hence, alternative waste disposal methods such as composting, recycling etc. can be potential options for sustainable solid waste management. Such methods will also reduce the waste volume prior to reaching the landfill and will increase the landfill’s life. This paper aims to calculate the recovery value from Municipal Solid Waste (i.e. composting, biogas, paper, and plastic) in Jeetpur Simara Sub-Metropolitan City (JSSMC) in Nepal, and to calculate the area required for landfilling and dumping of biodegradable and residual solid waste respectively. Due to high biodegradable content (8,400 kg/day), the recovery values from compost and biogas generation are studied. Optimum distribution of biodegradable solid waste among these two options is also evaluated. A combination of 6.4 tons/day for composting and 2 tons/day for landfilling with a net recovery of NRs. 29,064 per day is calculated. The recovery values from plastic and paper are calculated at NRs. 11,088 and NRs. 15,048 respectively. Hence, a total recovery value of NRs. 201.48 lakhs per year is suggested. This revenue is excluding the construction and operation cost required for the establishment of compost plant and landfill biogas collection system. The area required to landfill 2 tons/day of degradable waste is 0.876 hectares and 4.06 hectares to dump residual solid waste for a design period of 15 years. In case, biogas is not extracted, a total of 4.936 hectares’ land is required for dumping the entire MSW generated from JSSMC. The revenue calculated reduces to NRs. 47,640 per day or NRs. 173.88 lakhs per year.HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water, Energy and Environment Issue: 23Year: 2018",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/20831/17108,,SDG 14: Life Below Water

Although the majority of households in Kathmandu are connected to a private tap, they experience intermittent water supply. We link a unique time diary dataset collected between 2014 and 2015 to household water consumption and tap water reliability data. Our empirical analyses demonstrate that improved reliability of private tap water connection (PWC), measured as self-reported reliability and an objective measure of ‘probability of getting tap water in the next hour’, leads to increased time spent on water collection. Households with more reliable PWC also consume more water overall and from their own taps. Further investigation demonstrates that when private taps became more reliable, households substituted water collected from outside the household, such as water from public taps and public wells, with water from their own private taps. Our results proved robust to additional specification checks.",http://iwaponline.com/wp/article-pdf/21/S1/76/632497/021000076.pdf,,SDG 14: Life Below Water
