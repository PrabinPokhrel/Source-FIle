The primary data was used to determine the factors influencing the Nepalese tourism industry in order to explore them. The questionnaire survey was conducted from March to May 2019. Data was collected from managers of sample hotels &amp; travel agencies and tourists visiting various places of Nepal. An exploratory research design was used. Simple descriptive statistical tools such as frequencies, mean, standard deviation, and rank were used as statistical tools. The results show that the heritage tourism, religious tourism, cultural tourism, adventure or eco-tourism, wildlife tourism, and sports tourism are the positive factors whereas lack of infrastructure, ineffective promotional policies, inadequate tourist’s services and facilities, inadequate knowledge and training of personnel in the tourism sector, inadequate infrastructure facilities, and lack of incentives in the tourist sector are the negative factors. The important aspect or value of this research is that it has brought into consideration almost all the important factors that are affecting the Nepalese tourism industry according to the view of managers and tourists.

Ganoderma and its allied products are a multi-billion-dollar worth industry worldwide. Ganoderma, which is considered an important non-timber forest product (NTFP) in Nepal, has entered the industrial market only a decade ago. Besides the global market, the domestic market has grown dramatically in recent years. Ganoderma is collected in large quantities (about 4-10 tons per year) from Nepalese forests to meet its rising demand and is mostly sold to China in crude form. Since the authority has poor knowledge of the Ganoderma market it is transported with minimal royalty of US$ 0.043/kg under the heading entitled “sadharan chyau”. Almost all of Nepal's Ganoderma comes from natural stands, with the bulk coming from the Karnali (46%) and Far West (50%) provinces. With the great potential for the Ganoderma business, most of the other areas of the country have yet to be fully explored. By establishing processing units and offering locally priced micro-enterprise technologies, there are several opportunities for value addition. However, it looks that sustaining a steady supply of this highly sought mushroom will be tough. Concerns have been expressed about overexploitation of wild Ganoderma obtained in an unsustainable way or at an early stage. For the long-term management of Ganoderma and its habitat protection, a solid local resource monitoring system and scientific intervention for artificial cultivation are required. This study attempts to summarize the trade dynamics and development of the Ganoderma industry in Nepal with reference to the global Ganoderma industry.",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

It considers the annual data of four macroeconomic variables that affect the NEPSE Index; inflation rate, broad money supply, gross domestic product, and per capita income from 2011-2021 and tries to find out the influence of these variables on the NEPSE index (stock prices). It uses the Pearson correlation matrix to study the relationship between stock prices ad macroeconomic variables. The results obtained from correlation analysis revealed that market performance of stock prices is found to respond positively to broad money supply and gross domestic product and negatively to the inflation rate as expected. Also, the NEPSE index is not affected by the changes in the per capita income of the nation. These findings help to build up economic and financial policies in the nation and stabilize the capital stock market in Nepal.",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

This is perhaps an unsurprising conclusion, but still worth noting given the current policy debates about development aid around the world, which range from 'close the [World] Bank!' on the one hand to 'triple development aid!' on the other (Verweij and Gyawali 2006). Nepal is strewn with highly expensive development failures that have lined the pockets of Western consultants and companies, as well as less-than-honest domestic decision makers (see Chapters 3, 4 and 10). These include the infamous Arun 3 dam and similarly large hydro projects, often pushed by the World Bank and other aid donors (Chapter 8). They also include the ill-fated privatisation of Bara Forest, foisted upon local communities by a Finnish logging company and the Finnish International Development Agency in the 1980s (Chapter 1).",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines.

Ecologically sensitive areas as well as mountainous regions face some similar challenges when it comes to solid waste management (SWM). This study recommends that solutions need to be steadily built on a framework in order to successfully and sustainably manage mountain waste. This report presents various recommendations and implementable actions that may be adopted in a phased manner in order to overcome SWM challenges faced in mountain areas. The presented recommendations to manage solid waste in mountain areas are generally aligned with the integrated SWM framework and are summarized in the report. This study represents the first attempt of the World Bank to examine SWM issues in these unique, ecologically fragile areas that face concurrent challenges of high poverty and increasing pressures from tourism development. Chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two discusses the current landscape of the SWM sector in Nepal. In chapter three, the report investigates the current situation regarding SWM in the mountain areas of Nepal. Chapter four looks at the complexity of managing solid waste in mountain areas as well as the various challenges and opportunities that arise. Chapter five presents a framework or foundation on which solutions can be steadily built and presents recommendations and related implementable actions along a phased approach. In conclusion, chapter six briefly summarizes the role of the World Bank in the SWM sector and how it can provide support to clients to improve SWM services and practices in mountain areas in the South Asia region and elsewhere.

Among them, the flood is one of the natural disasters and that occurred in the Narayani River basin. The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising. In order to effectively manage and prepare for potential flood hazards in the study area, an analysis of the flood risk assessment was conducted by taking into consideration three primary factors: the flood hazard map, flood exposure, and flood vulnerability. The layers of the population, crops, schools, hospitals, and road network were all exposed to flooding, and the factors that determined flood vulnerabilities were literacy, urban area, and agecomposition (less than 14 and more than 65). The higher flood risk area was found in Ward number 1, 3, 4,16,18,26 of Bharatpur metropolitan, Gaindakot municipality ward number 1 and 12, 15 of Madhyabindu Municipality.",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The main aim of this study is to identify and evaluate the durability characteristics of some sandstones against slaking, freezing-thawing and abrasion. Lithosomes were characterized in the field. The following laboratory tests included measurements of dry density, specific gravity, water absorption, Slake Durability Index (SDI), Sulphate Soundness (SS), and Los Angles Abrasion (LAA). Sandstones from the Lower Siwalik Subgroup (LSS) are massive to cross-stratified, very fine- to medium-grained, and occasionally calcareous, whereas the sandstone from the Middle Siwalik Subgroup (MSS) are mostly cross-stratified to few massive, medium- to coarse-grained with salt-and-pepper appearance, and uncommonly calcareous. Sandstones have four different types of deterioration and had high to extremely high SDI. The majority of the sandstones have displayed similar slaking tendencies. Under the five-cycle SS test, the majority of sandstones from LSS and MSS have experienced low final weight loss (below 10%). However, two from LSS and three from MSS have experienced greater final weight loss. The LAA values range from 29.66% to 99.14%, and except two sandstones from LSS, rest of the samples have exceeded 45% abrasion showing they were incompetent in terms of abrasion test, and are highly susceptible to abrasion. The uniformity factor ranges from 0.21 to 0.44 indicating that all the sandstones were of non-uniform hardness.

The experiences gathered from Irrigation Sector Projects implemented under various donor agencies such as the World Bank (WB), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and UN/ILO have shown that successful irrigation projects must be defined and planned according to specific ecological regions and pertinent to the local environment. An integrated development approach considers the land use, roads, market, and other economic activities as they relate to prospects for poverty alleviation. Land evaluation and subsequent land use planning according to the soil, climate, land profile, and suitability of agriculture practices should be considered in the development works to ensure true benefit to the rural populations. The integrated approach as such will provide long term sustainability through environmentally sound practices. This approach has been widely applied in the European countries, Korea, Japan, and Sri Lanka.This paper primarily focuses on the irrigation and development approaches most suitable to Nepal’s three ecological regions. High mountain regions should be developed with pasture land, horticulture, organic vegetable farming, and tourism. Irrigation technology in these areas should be simple pipe conveyance, and tank irrigation. In the mid-hills horticulture on the sloping terrain and cereal crops in the river valleys with other diversified cropping systems should be applied. The Terai region is the ‘Bread Basket’ of Nepal, and has high potential for diversified agriculture and industrial development.For development in these regions to succeed, road networks and transportation facilities are essential to economic growth. Road transportation maximizes opportunity for tourism and other economic activities. Development work must be planned in an integrated approach, which should be based on appropriate land use patterns for environmentally sustainable practices. An ideal solution would be to envision the watershed as the unit for eco-friendly sustainable development planning involving all the stakeholders under the watershed purview. As an example, the principles of Integrated Water Resources Management Planning (IWRMP), and Integrated Watershed Management Plan (IWMP) have been successfully applied in the USA and Australia (Box 1). It has illustrated that vegetative covered catchment stores large amount of rain water, increases groundwater table, reduces erosion of soil, and lastly decreases the intensity of flood hazard. Whereas, the naked catchment areas are highly erodible, does not store rain water, susceptible to high erosion and landslides, and increases the flood intensity by three fold than a vegetative covered one. The vegetative cover increases the water resources availability for over all development for agriculture.                               HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 20Page: 31-40",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/16486/13409,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

However, prevalence of uptake of female sterilization in central hilly region is less than the national average. The objective of the study was to explore the number and factors related to intention of married women to undergo female sterilization in rural Kathmandu which lies within central hilly region. Materials and Methods: This is a community based cross-sectional survey research conducted in rural area of Kathmandu valley. Two hundred and forty currently married women with at least one child of any age were interviewed using a structured pre-tested questionnaire.Results: More than four-fifth of the respondents intended to undergo sterilization. Almost two-third of them wanted to limit their family size by taking this option. More than one-third of women not-intending to undergo sterilization feared weakness after sterilization. Age of the respondents, duration of marriage, and number of living children were significantly associated with intention to undergo sterilization. 15-24 years age group were six times more likely to have the intention for sterilization (OR 6.79, CI 2.28-20.19) compared to age 35 years and above group. Mothers with less than 3 living children are about three times more likely to have the intention to undergo sterilization (OR 2.87, CI 1.3-6.33) compared to women with more than 2 living children. Women married for 6 to 10 years were three times more likely to have the intention (OR 3.0, CI 1.09-8.27). However, gender of the living children was not associated with intention to undergo sterilization.Conclusion: There were significant numbers of women intending to undergo sterilization. Age of the mother, number of living children and the duration of marriage were found to be significantly influencing the intention to undergo sterilization. However, as intention refers to future plan, the respondents’ intention may change over time.

Field visits with a checklist, a Questionnaire survey, Key informant interviews were the main methods of data collection. The data was analysed using the Relative Importance Index and descriptive statics.The past performance of the system indicates irrigation coverage of only 4,700 Ha of the pump scheme that too with occasional supplements to the Khageri irrigation system in the event of scarcity. Dispute during the water distribution time was frequently observed and the role of NLIWUA was effective in dispute management.The system operation changes were observed in the socio-economic and agricultural status of the users. An increase in the economic status by 45% is noted, 55.4 % of farmers have been motivated towards agriculture. A shift of farmers from rice plantations to cash crops is noted. The operational cost and maintenance cost of components of the pump house were allocated by Government. The budget allocated was sufficient only for the temporary maintenance, but the system needs proper rehabilitation.

Nepali city leaders are also aspiring to make their cities smart. A smart city basically has clever improvements made in three sectors of its operations: technological, human, and institutional. Globally, many cities have recently made impressive enhancements in at least one or more of these areas. Nepal’s National Planning Commission (NPC) in 2016 had released a concept paper on smart cities for Nepal, defining smart cities as sustainable, information and technology-based, with high quality services and replicable (NPC 2016). As most Nepali cities still operate with limited infrastructure, services, and amenities, making them smart is a challenging task. However, some elements of a smart city can be incrementally and selectively implemented by the Nepali urban governments. This paper assesses the successes and challenges in some of the smart cities globally, and as an example assesses the pollution reduction and efficiency impact of adopting a bus-rapid transit system in Nepal. It is seen that a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system for the Kathmandu Valley consisting of electrical buses, will drastically reduce air pollution, and improve mobility for the residents. Urban leaders in Nepal can begin to identify such a transit related and other smart elements to be gradually implemented in their cities which will improve efficiency of urban services, enhance quality of life for the urban residents, and promote sustainability of the overall urban system.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/45769/35807,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The optimal method for restoring teeth after root canal therapy is, however, still under debate for a very long time. Therefore, this study was conducted to detect the frequency of preferred methods of restoring endodontically treated teeth under different conditions. Methods: A structured questionnaire was distributed among general practitioners of the Eastern region of Nepal to find out the frequency of the best suitable material and method regarding restoration of endodontically treated teeth. The questionnaires were sent by electronic mail and out of 180 individuals, 92 responded. The respondents were asked to choose their favourite technique for restoring those teeth. One-way frequency tables were generated to summarize the responses. Two-way cross-tabulation tables were computed to show the relationship between the variables. Results: The majority of the respondents 42(45.70%), preferred to restore the tooth only with a tooth-color restorative material under condition A (>50% of tooth structure remaining). Under condition B (50% of tooth structure remaining), the majority of respondents 48(52.20%), preferred to use tooth-coloured crown and prefabricated post and tooth-coloured restoration 21(22.80%).

The employability discourse, in the context of linking education with skills development, has gained increased attention globally. However, engagement with this agenda differs across countries, as it depends on the social, political and economic contexts. Hence it is essential to examine the different aspects of employability, its historical development and strategic interventions to improve it. With this in mind, existing models, policies, frameworks, interventions, reforms and practices in selected countries were analyzed. This analysis was then interwoven with Social Cognitive Career Theory to present a model of employability in Nepal. The model links the family, academic institutions and industries/employers, which are dedicated directly or indirectly to enhancing employability among people. Collaboration and coordination among academic institutions and industries yield various benefits to people entering the job market; importantly, these benefits help students who rarely have opportunities to develop their employability skills in their family environment.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/09504222221151138,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Ultrasonography is used for evaluating symptomatic patients especially those with dense breasts where mammography gives limited information. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sonographic pattern of the palpable breast lumps and correlate with the final pathological diagnosis.Methods: This was a retrospective study done at our tertiary health care center, from July 2016 to March 2017, including 121 patients presenting to the ultrasound department with complaint of palpable breast lump and whose pathological reports could be followed up. Various sonographic features were studied, sonography and final diagnosis compared.Results: On sonography, about 46% of the cases were benign, 35 % malignant and 18 % indeterminate while tissue diagnosis revealed 63% to be benign, 34% malignant. The most common lesions in each group and sonographic characteristics were evaluated. Of the benign lesions, fibroadenoma was the most common. Most of the indeterminate lesions on sonography were histologically mastitis. We found nearly 58% of the malignant lesions had microlobulated margins. The sensitivity of sonography was 92.9% and specificity 97.5% with diagnostic accuracy 94.8%.Conclusions: Most of the palpable lumps were benign in our study, most common being fibroadenoma. We had a relatively higher percentage of malignancy which may be due to patients with obviously benign lesions not undergoing tissue diagnosis in our setting.

Such screening programs and related data are lacking in less developed countries. We documented and analyzed the mammographic trends at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, a tertiary care referral center, in Kathmandu, Nepal, to develop baseline data which may be helpful in further researches.Methods: In this descriptive study, imaging findings of consecutive patients who had undergone mammography between July 2016 and March 2018 were reviewed after obtaining ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Committee. Ultrasonography and histopathological examination were done as needed. Demographics, presenting complaints, breast density, Breast Imaging, Reporting, Assessment and Data System category and final diagnosis were recorded and analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.Results: There were more diagnostic mammograms (62%) than screening with mastalgia the most common presenting complaint. Breast density was less in screening group. Overall, there were more benign lesions with incidence of breast cancer being 4.4% more in the diagnostic group. The age range varied from 22 to 86 years, with 15% (n=219) below 40 years age accounting for one-third of the cases of extremely dense breast and one-fourth of the suspicious lesions. Nearly 50% of breast cancers were seen in patients less than 50 years of age.Conclusions: The study showed greater number of diagnostic than screening mammograms, with malignancies detected more often in the diagnostic group and younger age. Fewer screening studies suggest a lack of breast cancer awareness in our population who seek medical help only when symptomatic.

However, there is a widespread view that young men and women are becoming more at ease in each other's company and beginning sexual experiences prior to marriage, putting them at risk of the consequences of unsafe sex. This research aims to evaluate the factors associated with premarital sexual behavior and its consequences among Nepalese college-going adolescents and youths. This cross-sectional web-based study included 415 Nepalese students over the age of 18 who were enrolled in a bachelor's degree program in a discipline other than health science. Data was collected from students online using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Pearson's chi-square (χ2) and logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between the independent and outcome variables. Most participants (61.7%) had dating experience and 21.2% had premarital sex. About three-fourths (76.1%) of participants had premarital sex before the age of 20 years and the ages of sexual debut ranged from 13 to 25 years. The major reasons for sexual debut were desire, curiosity, continuation of love relationship, and peer pressure. One-third of students (33.0%) reported having more than two sex partners, and 11.4% had intercourse with commercial sex workers. Among students who had premarital sex, 13.7% of participants or their sex partners, had to undergo abortions because of unintended pregnancies. Having an illiterate parent (AOR=11.0; 95% CI=2.01-60.87), high pocket money (AOR=4.2; 95% CI=1.1-16.2), increased dating culture (AOR=18.8; 95% CI=4.8-74.2), a close friend who has experienced premarital sex (AOR=5.2; 95% CI=2.21-12.21), and exposure to pornography (AOR=97.87; 95% CI= 9.5-10001.4) were predictors of premarital sex among Nepalese college students.

Among various retainers used, Hawley retainer and ‘invisible’ retainers are the most common. Most of the orthodontists favored permanent retention. It is obvious that the retention procedures are variable and depended largely on personal preferences, and there does not seem to be any consistent pattern in the application of retention methodologies. The  purpose of this study was to survey the retention protocols among orthodontists in Nepal. Materials and Method: The complete lists of the names and addresses of orthodontists in Nepal was obtained from the ODOAN. The questionnaire was sent to them which consisted of multiple-choice questions and short answer, related to background information of the individual orthodontist, retention use in general, the frequency of different types of bonded or removable retainers that are used, the retention protocol, the type of retainer used in specific situation. All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 12.0.1 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA) Result: The survey questionnaires were completed by 90.42% of the 94 orthodontists of Nepal, 58.8% males and 41.2% females with a mean age of 36.7 years. Most of the orthodontists used a clear (vacuum) retainer (80%) in the maxilla and fixed bonded retainer in the mandible. Most of them prefer the use of retainer for a continuous 24 hours except during eating and brushing for 6 months to 1 year (56.5%) and if possible, for 1 to 2 years (28.2%). Conclusion: Majority of Nepalese orthodontists provide vacuum formed retainer on maxillary arch and bonded retainer in mandibular arch.

The study has made use of correlation analysis, Jonckheere-Terpstra test, as well as post hoc and Mann-Whitney U tests. Measured by management hierarchies, the study concludes that entry level category of employees are most influenced by rewards and compensation increasing their commitment towards the organisation to reduce their turnover, whereas in case of higher level managers, the employer branding is an important retention measure. Likewise, the negative and significant relationship exists between career growth and age group indicating such age group employees are interested in balanced work life and employer branding for retention. The study also concludes that for male hotel employees, career growth and balanced work life are the strongest and weakest retention measures in Nepalese five star hotels.",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Statistics shows that around 400 families were relocated from Haku Post-earthquake (MoFA, 2015). A total of 101 co-seismic landslides were focused during the study and were verified during the fieldwork in Haku village. The conditioning factors used in this study were slope, aspect, elevation, curvature (plan and profile), landuse, geology and PGA. The conditioning factor maps were prepared in GIS working environment and further analysis was conducted with the assistance of Google earth. This study used Weight of Evidence (WoE), a bivariate statistical model and its performance was assessed. The susceptibility map was further characterized into five different classes namely very low, low, high, medium and very high susceptibility zones. The statistical analysis obtained from the results of the susceptibility map prepared by using WoE model gave the results that maximum area percentage of landslide distribution was observed in medium and high susceptibility classes i.e. 38% and 33% followed by very high (13%), low (10%) and very low classes (5.8%) About 25% of the total landslides are separated to validate the prepared model used in the landslide susceptibility zonation.

The data collected were related to patients’ demographics, site of catheter insertion, and duration, microbiological data including cultures from catheter sites, blood, and catheters’ tips and antibiotic sensitivity. Catheter related infection was divided into catheter related local infection (CRLI) and catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI). Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 21.0. Results: A total of 41 cases of CVC related infection (CRI) were documented with an incidence rate of 6.94 episodes per 1000 catheter days at risk. Out of the total CRI, 39.02% were CRLI and 60.98% were CRBSI. Fever with chills and rigor were the most common clinical presentation. Risk factors for the development of CRI were duration of catheter in situ, repeated change of CVC and the use of CVC for indications other than hemodialysis (HD). Staphylococci and Klebsiella were the most common organisms isolated in culture. Conclusion: The rate of CRI among Nepalese patients undergoing hemodialysis is high. Prolonged duration of CVC usage, recent change of catheter and the use of the HD catheter for the purpose of institution of intravenous medication have been found as the risk factors for CRI.",https://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/1036/953,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Economic hardships mean that in such countries, many children and young people are exploited in the labour force and/or are trafficked, placing them at greater risk for being exposed to other forms of maltreatment. Cultural norms endorsing the use of physical and emotional acts to discipline children further exacerbate this risk. Here, we assessed the rates of childhood victimisation experiences and associated mental health problems in Nepalese youth rescued from illegal child labour including trafficking. Methods: One hundred and three young people aged 12–18 years living in out-of-home care institutions and rescued from child labour/trafficking completed translated versions of selected modules from the Juvenile Victimisation Questionnaire, the Youth Inventory and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Care-home employees responsible for looking after the young people completed the Adolescent Symptom Inventory and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Analysis described maltreatment frequencies and compared individuals who had and had not experienced any form of maltreatment on the presence/absence of psychiatric diagnoses. Results: Seventy-two percent of participants experienced some form of maltreatment in their lifetime. Rates for each maltreatment type were 46.6% for physical abuse, 40.77% for emotional abuse, 27.2% for sexual abuse and 33% for neglect. Symptoms indicative of anxiety disorders and trauma were commonly reported especially in victims of childhood maltreatment. Conclusions: Our estimates of physical abuse in this at-risk juvenile sample were commensurate to those reported in general-population youth samples in Nepal, but sexual and emotional abuse rates were somewhat lower. The potential presence of anxiety and trauma in this sample that may result from maltreatment requires replication, but underscores an urgent need for routine mental health screening in rescued child labourers during rehabilitation efforts.",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

With the inclusion of serum calcium measurement in routine biochemistry panel, majority of primary hyperparathyroidism can be detected in earlier asymptomatic phase. Preoperative localization by Ultrasonography and Sestamibi scan combined together along with CT or MRI in ectopic adenoma enables for focused minimal invasive surgery. Intraoperative intact PTH (IPTH) measurement is used as a surgical quality control in primary hyperparathyroidism surgery. This study was undertaken to look into current status of surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism in the tertiary care center in Nepal. Methods: This was a prospective observational study conducted in Department of Surgery. Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital Kathmandu, Nepal from November 2014 to October 2016. Demography profile, preoperative symptoms, duration of symptoms, preoperative serum calcium, phosphate, immediate preoperative iPTH level and intraoperative iPTH level, post-operative calcium level and localization techniques were recorded. Final pathology report of each of the patients were recorded. Results: Thirteen patients were operated for primary hyperthyroidism. Mean age of the patients was 36:15 years. None of the patient had multi-glandular disease on preoperative localization. Mean preoperative Calcium level was 12.8±0.9 mg/dl and mean preoperative iPTH level was 998+805 pg ml. As Intraoperative iPTH measurement was used to ascertain the successful adenoma removal, mean IPTH intraoperative iPTH after the removal of the adenoma was 175±167 pg/ml. Mean difference of iPTH was 823±725 (p 0.024). There was mean decrease of 81% of iPTH after surgery well above 50% decrease confirmatory of successful adenoma removal. None of patients had reported with recurrent symptoms till date. Conclusion: Hypercalcemia should be subjected for iPTH scanning to identify more asymptomatic patients and Surgery is key treatment and intraoperative iPTH assay is used for confirmation of adenoma removal.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/954/910,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Before using this tool in any population, its validation needs to be assessed. This study was carried out to check validation in cardiac surgical patients in Nepalese patients. Method: This is a prospective observational analytical cohort study in 500 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement surgeries (mitral valve, aortic valve or double valve replacements) and valve and aorta replacement surgeries (Bentall procedure). The data were entered in the Microsoft excel software and were analyzed using Chi Square test from Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Version - 17) package. Calibration power and discriminative power were calculated. Result: The model’s validation was assessed by its calibration and discriminative power. Calibration power was assessed using Hosmer- Lemeshow test (Chi-square test). It gave P value of 0.14 indicating that the model adequately fits the data and can predict mortality. Discriminative power was assessed by calculating area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve which was 0.71 indicating satisfactory discriminative power. In low and moderate risk groups, observed and predicted (additive and logistic) mortality were satisfactory. In high risk group, observed mortality was higher than predicted mortality. Logistic EuroSCORE value was nearer to observed value. Conclusion: EuroSCORE can be applied in Nepalese cardiac surgical patients in low and moderate risk groups satisfactorily though additive EuroSCORE is better in prediction. In high risk groups, logistic and additive EuroSCORE under predicted outcome than the observed mortality. However logistic EuroSCORE was better in this group of patients.

Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 22 executives and managers of listed companies in Nepal. A reflexive thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the data. Findings: Strategic imperatives, coercive factors and moral considerations characterize the major drivers of firms’ CSR practices in Nepal. Specifically, a firm’s reputation, publicity, legal requirements, enlightened shared values and cultural tradition are the main drivers of CSR. Strategic imperatives are the main drivers of CSR for banking and financial institutions, whereas external institutional pressures are the main drivers for other sectors. Practical implications: Managers can make institutional arrangements for CSR to fulfill their strategic needs and better respond to formal (e.g. legal requirements) and informal (e.g. cultural tradition) institutional factors. Policymakers can incorporate fiscal-economic instruments, such as CSR awards, in CSR-related legal provisions to simultaneously fulfill the strategic needs of the business and social goals of the government.

Presence of evergreen subtropical and temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest, needle-leaved element, and high altitude taxa show a mixed pollen assemblage in fluvial-lacustrine sediments of the graben. The presence of evergreen subtropical and temperate deciduous broadleaf forest (Quercus, Betula, Juglans, Alnus), needle-leaved element (Pinus, Tsuga) and high altitude taxa (Picea, Abies) with Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae show mixed pollen assemblages indicating warm and humid paleoclimate. The coniferous pollen indicates the altitude was higher during the deposition time and the presence of Betula, Quercus, and Juglans suggests temperate forest. Domination of Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae shows a strong influence of the Himalayan topographic barrier during the sediment deposition.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/31260/24731,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Imminent water crisis due to climate change, water demanding nature of traditionally cultivated rice, increasing scarcity of labor and escalating labor costs drive the search for alternative management methods to increase water productivity, system sustainability and profitability in rice cultivation. Direct seeded rice (DSR) technique has received much attention and popularity nowadays because of its low-input demanding nature that can mitigate emission of green-house gases and adaption to climatic risks. DSR involves sowing of dry seed into a prepared seedbed, pre-germinated seed into a puddled soil surface and standing water. The development of early maturing varieties and use of efficient nutrient management practices along with increased adoption of integrated weed management techniques have encouraged many farmers to switch from transplanted to DSR culture. DSR technology is highly mechanized in some developed countries like USA, Australia, Japan, China, Korea etc. This shift from traditional rice to DSR will substantially reduce crop water requirements, soil organic-matter turnover, enhanced nutrient management, carbon sequestration, weed management, greenhouse-gas emissions and enhance crop intensification. However, weed and nematode infestation, blast, panicle sterility, lack of suitable varieties for DSR and lodging are major challenges. Based on existing evidences, this paper reviews the integrated package of technologies for DSR, potential advantages and challenges associated with it.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44786/33689,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The mechanism of the LSL failure process is not well understood due to the different deformation stages controlled by geological structures and causative/ triggering factors. Regional tectonic structures and local rock mass characteristics play a vital role in the formation of LSLs. Engineering geological characterization was performed to evaluate the rock/soil properties, and the associated state of danger (cracks, seepage, etc.). The rock mass rating (RMR) and geological strength index (GSI) methods were used to estimate rock mass quality and strength parameters. The estimated strength parameters together with laboratory test data were used to set up a two-dimensional (2D) landslide surface to simulate the failure scenarios. The simulation of landslide models was iterated under different loading conditions by incorporating geological heterogeneities. The results have demonstrated that the movement of the slope was affected by different stress conditions over time, which were verified using spatiotemporal landslide data. The landslide exhibited a three-stage failure mechanism with the development of tension-induced cracking at the rear and shearing failure of the critical locking section in the middle section. The tension shear and joint-step-path rupture along joint surfaces occurred during different stages of the landslide failure processes. The simulated results showed that the genetic development of LSL is mainly attributed to the geological structures and sudden changes in stress conditions. Thus, the research outcomes can be illustrative to evaluate the role of geological discontinuities, geotechnical parameters and triggering effects by the numerical simulation techniques for the failure mechanism of LSLs.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57921/43297,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The aim of this research is to identify the distribution pattern of LSL and all landslides in the central Nepal Himalaya and evaluation of their controlling factors. 7239 landslides were extracted from the study area by the interpretation of satellite imageries and field surveyed information. 28 landslides were classified as LSL and descriptive statistics were calculated. A comparative susceptibility assessment between all landslides and LSL was performed by frequency ratio model (FRM). Landslide susceptibility assessed from FRM was classified into five categories using the natural breaks method and adjustment from field evidences: very low, low, medium, high, and very high. The very high, high and medium susceptibility classes comprised of 38.91%, 33.29%, 18.76% for all landslides, and 39.51%, 29.65%, 20.98% for LSL. The result clearly indicated that the role of controlling factors varies differently depending upon the size of distributed landslides. To understand the significance of controlling factors for LSL, different potential cases were validated by success rates with area under the curve (AUC). The computed AUC in success rates for LSL is 65% and for overall landslides with similar controlling factors is 75%. The AUC values in different potential cases showed that the prime factors to control the LSL are geomorphology, rainfall, and geological structures.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/50846/37988,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Only tourism can transform the nation because other sector of economy requires extensive capital and skillful human resource. Nepal cannot compete with India in Agricultural Production and with China in other industrial productions. Nation’s investment in Agriculture and Industries are in high risks. At this crucial juncture of time Nepal government has announced visit Nepal 2020, which could be a milestone of Nepalese Economic Development. To analyze the challenges and opportunities to welcome 2 million tourists in 2020 the study has been designed. Tourism is a social phenomenon that promotes the movement of visitors to a region or destination in the world with certain natural or artificial features aimed to leisure and rest. Methodologically, it is a qualitative descriptive analysis of available secondary information on Nepalese tourism industry and academia. The method analyzes entire facts qualitatively and interprets the meaning of tourism information. The tourism industry’s viability is based on its natural and cultural environment. The environment encompasses air, land, water, art, history, architect, festivals, and hospitability of people. The foreign tourists and excursionists’ primary interest in Nepal is to study its culture and nature not dust, dirt, and mismanagement of roads etc. Mayors of local governments must be aware on these issues. Nepal’s unique form of musical expression and cultural vibes are becoming lost resulting in cultural dilution. Accessibilities and identification of tourist circuit along with standard food and well accommodation facilities are prior for tourism development for visit Nepal 2020.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/TUJ/article/download/28683/23399,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

This could result in the loss of lives and property, the relocation of people, the damage of physical infrastructures, homes, and the disruption of people's socioeconomic functions and the country's economy in a variety of ways. River flooding is caused by heavy monsoon rainfall, weak geology, unplanned infrastructure construction along the embankments, and mining in upstream riverbeds. The Andheri Khola (river) is a tributary of the Sunkoshi River that frequently floods, affecting the inhabitants along the way. In Nepal, little effort has been made to comprehend the flood risk in tiny catchment regions such as Andheri Khola, despite the fact that this sort of small catchment is affecting Nepal's numerous new rising towns and urban areas in many ways.

This study revealed that there is a significant increase in natural vegetation in all parts of the watershed. However, there is the highest rate of increase in vegetation in lower plain areas, where the population density is the highest. The overall increase in natural vegetation is because of the decreasing human and livestock population, changes in lifestyle, etc. The highest increase in natural vegetation in lower plain areas is because of the alternative use of cooking energy and building materials in urban and accessible areas, decreasing the number of livestock.

Some of the species like H. ellipticum, H. spicatum, H. coronarium are traditionally used as medicinal plants. In the present study, methanolic rhizome extracts of six different species of Hedychium namely H. spicatum, H. ellipticum, H. thyrsiforme, H. coccineum, H. gardnerianum and H. coronarium were analysed for their antioxidant, antidiabetic and antibacterial activities. The antioxidant activity analysed by DPPH assay showed the highest potential (lowest IC50 value) in H. coccineum (148.82±2.83 µg/ml) and lowest potential (maximum IC50 value) in H. thyrsiforme (996.55±9.42 µg/ml). The rhizome extracts of different species showed moderate α-amylase inhibition activity in vitro. The highest α-amylase inhibition (79.67%) was observed for H. coronarium while the lowest inhibition (64.0%) was observed in H. thyrsiforme.  However, these values were found lower than the value (92.37%) obtained for positive control, i.e., Acarbose. The antibacterial activity was determined against two Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and two Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacterial strains by agar well diffusion method. Except for H. ellipticum the extracts of all other species showed antibacterial activity against all the bacterial strains tested. The extracts of H. ellipticum showed antibacterial activity only against B. subtilis and K. pneumoniae. The extract of H. coronarium showed the highest zone of inhibition (16.67±1.15 mm) against B. subtilis. However, the antibacterial activity was weak compared to standard antibiotics for all the extracts and at all concentration tested. These results show that rhizomes of other species can also be used in the same manner as that of H. coronarium and H. spicatum, two species most used in various ethnomedicinal applications.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/jnba/article/download/63743/48190,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Objective: To measure the prevalence of mental problems among old people in a community setting. Methodology: All people of age ≥ 60 years from ‘Urlabari’, a city in eastern Nepal, being members of a local old-age committee were called to participate in this study. A total of 140 old people attended a health-camp and with informed written consent and authority approval, the response to the GHQ-12 and demographic information were collected. The GHQ-12 score ≥2 was adopted for ‘psychiatric caseness’ analysis. However, people with scores ≥4 were assessed by a psychiatrist for further evaluation and management. Diagnoses were made according the ICD-10. Results: Majority (87%) were in age groups of (61-70) and (71-80) years. Many (44%) had stressors, common being: dispute with family, illness and death of close person. Many old people had health complaints; mainly physical/ somatic, mood and anxiety symptoms. About 2/5th subjects 55 (39.29%) had GHQ-12 score ≥2 and 26.43% had ≥3; i.e. ‘psychiatric caseness’. Among the subjects with score ≥4 (23) assessed for psychiatric diagnosis, 21 (91.30%) had some ICD-10 diagnosis. Depression, adjustment and anxiety disorders were common diagnoses, and 2% had suicidality. Conclusion: A remarkable proportion of old people had current ‘psychiatric caseness’. Common mental disorders were depression, adjustment and anxiety disorders among elder people.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JPAN/article/download/57630/43140,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The disease affects the rural poor socio-economical community causing significant death among untreated patients (Per capita income of Nepal US $ 400.00). An effort was made to estimate treatment cost on clinically diagnosed VL patients in three VL endemic districts of Eastern development region of Nepal.Materials & Methods: During one and half year period in 2012/2013, approximately 500 cases were diagnosed as VL from three district hospitals; two zonal hospitals and one tertiary level hospital of Eastern Terai districts of Nepal. Total 172 cases were selected randomly from the three VL endemic districts of Eastern Nepal and interviewed at their homes. Results: On an average, cost for VL treatment during hospitalization was Nepali Rupees (NRS) 4032.67±313.47, where median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 17 (five to 35) days. The patients were  iagnosed symptomatically as VL after 45 ± 6 days of feeling illness. The treatment cost of patient before diagnosis was NRS 2379.93 ± 202.30. Patient reached the treatment center after 17 ± 2 days of diagnosis and referral from community level. Total 83.7% patients came for follow-up after average 30 ± 2 days of discharge with an average expense of RS 360.34 ± 49.88. The death rate of VL patients during treatment and within one month of discharge was 7.6%. It was found that the average funeral cost was NRs 9598.00 ± 1259.00. Conclusion: This study concludes that, average treatment cost for VL treatment during hospital stay was NRs 4032 and before treatment was around NRS 2380 and follow up cost was NRs 360. Early diagnosis and treatment in treatment center without significant delay can not only reduce the hospital stay and treatment cost, but also saves life of VL patients.JCMS Nepal. 2016;12(2):60-5",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JCMSN/article/download/15454/12556,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Tobacco control advocates successfully countered tobacco industry (TI) interference to force implementation of law. Aims and Methods: Policy documents, news stories, and key informant interviews were triangulated and interpreted using the Policy Dystopia Model (PDM). Results: The TI tried to block and weaken the law after Parliament passed it. Tobacco control advocates used litigation to force implementation of the law while the TI used litigation in an effort to block implementation. The TI argued that tobacco was socially and economically important, and used front groups to weaken the law. Tobacco control advocates mobilized the media, launched public awareness campaigns, educated the legislature, utilized lawsuits, and monitored TI activities to successfully counter TI opposition. Conclusions: Both tobacco control advocates and the industry used the discursive and instrumental strategies described in the PDM. The model was helpful for understanding TI activities in Nepal and could be applied to other low- and middle-income countries. Civil society, with the help of international health groups, should continue to track TI interference and learn the lessons from other countries to proactively to counter it. Implications: The PDM provides an effective framework to understand battles over implementation of a strong tobacco control law in Nepal, a low- and middle-income country. The TI applied discursive and instrumental strategies in Nepal in its efforts to weaken and delay the implementation of the law at every stage of implementation. It is important to continuously monitor TI activities and learn lessons from other countries, as the industry often employ the same strategies globally. Tobacco control advocates utilized domestic litigation, media advocacy, and engaged with legislators, politicians, and other stakeholders to implement a strong tobacco control law.

This article reviews how Nepal overcame industry opposition and to a comprehensive tobacco control law implementing the FCTC. Methods: We triangulated newspaper articles and policy documents with key informant interviews. Results: With the support of international health groups, local tobacco control advocates worked with policymakers in Nepal to pass a comprehensive tobacco control law that exceeded FCTC obligations. The tobacco industry exploited a time of political transition to block consideration by Parliament, arranged and sponsored foreign tours for legislators, made death threats to tobacco control advocates and their families, and argued for the economic importance of tobacco farms. Despite strong interference from Health, and Law and Justice ministers, a 2009 Supreme Court ruling helped tobacco control advocates secure a comprehensive tobacco control law in 2011 that included rotating pictorial health warning labels covering 75% of both sides of cigarette packages, 100% smoke free public places and workplaces, private homes and vehicles, and a tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship ban. Conclusions: Advocates in developing countries should utilize Nepal's experience to reject tobacco industry offers of compromise and continue educating politicians and legislators to generate political support to pass a comprehensive tobacco control law.

An investigation of diurnal cycle of precipitation revealed an afternoon maximum during the pre-monsoon season (March–May) and midnight–early morning maximum during the summer monsoon season (June–August)over the southern slopes of the Himalayas. The summer monsoon exhibited a robust spatial variation of diurnal cycle of precipitation, during afternoon-evening time, primary rainfall peak appeared along the Lesser Himalayas (~2,000–2,200 m above mean sea level), while early-morning rain in contrast showed maximum concentration along the southern margin of the Himalayas (~500–700 m above MSL). An afternoon-evening rainfall peak was attributed to higher rain frequency, whereas early-morning rainfall peak was attributed to fewer but rather intense rainfall. It is suggested that, confluence between down slope and moist south easterly monsoon flow triggers convection near the foothills of the Himalayas during early morning period.

Phenomenologists concentrate on the structures of consciousness as individuals experienced and expressed while turning an objective world or phenomenon into a subjective one through objectivation, internalization and externalization/ institutionalization process. The structuralist holds that the creation of an institution is a reproduction of interaction between structures and actors. And other theorists (e.g., Leach et al., 1999; Ostrom 2005, 2009; Gupta et al., 2010; Young, 2010) consider that institutions for natural resources conflate with social institutions and mediate their relations. Although these theories are not explicit epistemologically in a pragmatic sense, they have indicated language, rules, (embedded) practices and knowledge are the referential artifacts of institutions. These theories are found applicable in the institutionalization/socialization history of CF as it had gone through the social rejection (i.e, objectivation) during the 1970s, internalization during the 1980s, and socialization of it during and after the 1990s. The socialization of CF after the 1990s was due to the formation of CF as a social space (a ‘structure’ or ‘institution’) to discuss social and environmental issues into one place where forest dependent users (‘actors’) rationalize the use of forest and its conservation for local environment in a more pragmatic sense (i.e., mediate people-nature relations). An institution for natural resources is, therefore, the combined perspectives of phenomenologists, structuralists, and those who think institutions as a mediator of people-nature relations. Thus, an institution is political (i.e., relations and interactions) and ecological/economic (i.e., access to natural resources, livelihood practices).",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/35547/27788,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The process is key to sustainable forestry and can be accomplished through natural regeneration, which occurs when new seedlings or sprouts are produced by trees left on or near the site. The study is to calculate the regeneration status of the tree species in community-managed forests. The sampling points were generated by using the random table. The sample quadrate size was taken 20m×20m for a tree, 5m×5m for a sapling, and 1m×1m for the seedling. In five community forests, altogether 30 quadrates were taken for a tree, 60 nested quadrates were taken for a sapling and 120 nested quadrates were taken for a seedling. The tree layer, sapling layer and seedling layer were differentiated by taking reference tothe Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) class. An individual having DBH ≥ 5cm is considered a tree, an individual having DBH value between 1cm to < 5cm is considered a sapling, and individuals having 1cm to < 5cm DBH are considered as a seedling. The DBH distribution curve was obtained by plotting diameter class in x- axis and density on y- axis. All studied community forests are mixed forest dominated by tree species Castanopsis indica, Diospyros embryopteris (Diospyros malabarica), Shorea robusta, and Schima wallichii (Schima wallichii choisy). The regeneration potential of the Tilahar community forest(CF) is found high despite high grazing and other human intervention.

It is a developmental disorder seen in children usually recognized in school age. A learning disability may not be curable, but with the right support and intervention, children with learning disabilities can succeed in school and go on to successful, often distinguished careers later in life. The study’s objective is to assess the awareness level regarding learning disability among basic level teachers in selected schools of Pokhara. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was adopted among 128 basic level teachers in schools of Pokhara. A structured knowledge questionnaire was developed focusing on learning disabilities. About four Government school were selected by purposive sampling technique and basic level teachers were selected by total enumeration technique. Collected data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 23. Descriptive (mean, frequency, percentage, standard deviation) and inferential statistics (chi-square) test as per the nature of data. Results: The present study revealed that slightly more (50.8%) of the respondents had overall low awareness whereas (49.25%) of the respondents had overall high awareness regarding learning disability. There was a statistically significant association between family history, source of information (friend) and level of awareness at the p-value < 0.05. Conclusion: The result of the present study revealed that the level of awareness about learning disability among basic level teachers is low as none of them had adequate awareness on concept and definition of learning disability.

Laparoscopic techniques have become an integral part of the operative management in virtually every realm of general surgery. The success of the laparoscopic technique has been due mainly to patient demand, which has contributed to a rapid expansion in the number of laparoscopic procedures performedThe benefits conferred to patients by less invasive procedures like decreased pain, and shorter recovery time have to be weighed against overzealous application and the problems created by the lack of familiarity with new techniques and instruments.

According to the findings of this research, parcel fragmentation in Nepal is haphazard mainly focussing on urban and peri urban arears consequently parcel being irregular in shape & smaller in size and ultimately incrementing huge number of land owners with in fixed area. In the context of Nepal, factors that drive parcel fragmentation are cultural, social, legal, economical, frequent disasters, geographic variations, unmanaged migrations, haphazard land use planning amongst others. The uncontrolled and unmanaged parcel fragmentation in Nepal is the major challenge for land use planning and its implementation. Dense parcel fragmentation has created land related disputes. it is recommended that the government should reformulate and implement the proper land use policy as well as its supporting acts that encourage landconsolidation in agricultural zone and reducing haphazard parcel fragmentation in urban and peri urban areas.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJG/article/download/50885/38021,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Objectives: In the current constraint of poor availability of such information, National Census Sample Survey information was utilized to understand the mortality pattern of major forms of injuries in relation to all diseases. Methods: A nationally representative sample was drawn from six districts and 52 municipalities as a part of national census sample survey. The instrument included respondent-reported deaths in the family, the cause of death, the age and sex. Results: The national representative information on the pattern of diseases shows that there were7,010 deaths as a result of the external causes of injuries (4,803 males and 2,207 females) in a period of one year prior to the survey in 2001. Suicides, transport related accidents and other accidents accounted for the largest proportion of injuries. Other accidents ranked sixth, suicide 9th and transport accidents 10th leading cause of death for both sexes and all diseases. Conclusion: Injuries accounted for as many number of death as tuberculosis and many times more than malaria or HIV/AIDS in Nepal.

Nepal’s response to the US-led Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) signifies the same. For Nepal, crossing seas was culturally associated with sin as an objective to fulfill the isolationist policy adopted until the political change of 1950. As such, Nepal’s interaction with the sea was not so friendly in the past. However, these historical shreds of evidence cannot suffice as the reason behind her denial of joining the IPS. Most of the available literature divulges the sensitive geographical position of Nepal in the context of the rise of China and the projection of a ‘new Cold War’ for its reluctance to join the Indo-Pacific strategy. However, they fail to probe into the domestic intricacies contributing to the hesitation. In this context, this paper primarily tries to dwell upon the actors and factors that have influenced Nepal’s dubiety in joining the Indo-Pacific Strategy. Thus, this paper aims to fulfill two objectives. First, to analyze the role of geographical sensitivity, and second, to scrutinize the domestic interplay of things.

Improper visualization of primary fistulous tract and the associated abscesses or secondary tracts a r e the causes of recurrence. Earlier imaging modalities like conventional fistulography, endosonography and CT scan have had limited role. Even without endorectal coils, 3T MRI has multi-planar imaging capability and excellent soft tissue differentiation to show perianal anatomy, primary and secondary tracts with associated abscesses in relation to sphincter complex. It provides excellent road map to surgeons for preoperative evaluation. The objective of the study was to evaluate the role of 3T MR in imaging of perianal fistulas. Methods: A retrospective study was done among 32 patients who were referred for MR fistulogram for suspected perianal fistula at Jeebanta Advanced Kathmandu Imaging, Durbar Marg, Kathmandu, Nepal. All images and findings were obtained and recorded with the help of Philips Ingenia 3T digital broadband MR scanner. Imaging was performed in oblique coronal and oblique axial plane. MR images were studied and grading system was applied according to the St James’s University Hospital Classification. The data were entered in a performa and was analyzed using IBM SPSS V21. Results: Male to female ratio was 7:1.

In its findings, the paper underscores how Nepal's strategic location and its relationships with neighboring countries influence the proliferation of cross-border criminal activities. It emphasizes the interplay of supply and demand factors involving Nepal and its neighbors, demonstrating how geopolitical considerations contribute to the facilitation of organized crime through and within Nepal. The research also highlights how changing political and economic conditions in the region, combined with geographical factors, create fertile ground for the operations of organized criminal networks in Nepal.

If one looks at the total quantum of water that flows out of Nepal in one year, the above message sounds valid but as the flow of water is not under anybody’s control and flow occurs under gravity as it precipitates or exits the water springs, it should be considered in two dimensions: volume and time. In my opinion, Nepal is water stressed most of the time of year: flood stressed during the monsoon and drought stressed during the rest of the year. Nepal is rich in ice-mass, which is depleting at an alarming rate due to global warming giving rise to formation and increase in volume of glacial lakes that increases the vulnerability and risks to the economic activities along the river basins. Similarly, Nepal is rich ing round water resource with the total annual replenish able reserve of about 12 BCM mostly located in the Terai plains. The most debatable is the surface water that mostly falls as rain during the monsoon and cascades down crossing into India, is often devastating, as it passes. Nepal’s water resource is generally related to its hydropower potential calculated as 83,000MW by Dr. Hari Man Shrestha back in the sixties. Hydropower potential is a number that is based on the energy potential and the market, therefore, it is changing from time to time due to change in demand pattern and the market rates. Myopic view of looking at the Himalayan waters relating it to energy production as the energy production (TAF-June 2018) comprises a meager percentage of total benefit which lies mostly on multiple use of water directed towards the following two aspects: (1)Reduction in the losses of life and property due to floods and unwanted mountain phenomenon, mostly flood related disaster risk reduction, and (2) Flood Water management for converting the curse of floods into assets by way of its multiple uses, both consumptive as well as non-consumptive including food revolution, navigation, fishery, water supply, replenishment of ground water, energy production and recreation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/24569/20671,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Research related to these risk behaviors especially among adolescents is essential considering their role as future citizens of the country.Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the burden of cardiovascular risk behavior amongst the adolescents of Kaski district, Lekhnath Nepal.Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out among the adolescents of Lekhnath Muncipality Kaski District. Total 350 participants from five different schools from Lekhnath Muncipality took part in the study and the sampling technique was simple random method by using a random number table. Self administered questionnaires were used to collect information on identification of risk behaviors.Results: Descriptive statistics and Chi square test were computed. Out of 350 adolescents 175 males and remaining 175 females were interviewed. Alcohol and tobacco consumption were more amongst males whereas fast food and soft drinks were more amongst the females. Nearly 40% of the adolescents were not involved in physical activity. Tobacco and alcohol consumption was 26% and 16% respectively, which was higher amongst the late adolescents group studying in the 11th and 12th standard. In this study fruits and vegetables consumption was very less only 42% whereas soft drinks and fast food consumption was more 83% which shows that the adolescents are not aware about their food habits. Some participants did not consume fruits due to low purchasing power to buy fruits. Adolescence is a period of experimentation and so some participants told that they have just started taking alcohol and also started consuming tobacco for fun and were not aware that it was cardiovascular risk behavior.Conclusions: The adolescents had a high burden of cardiovascular risk behavior and if immediate intervention is not done to reduce these high risk behaviors many may be vulnerable to cardio vascular diseases in the future. J-GMC-N | Volume 11 | Issue 01 | January-June 2018, Page: 10-13",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/20787/17069,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

If such a waste is not collected, transported and disposed off, it not only results in causation of ‘Hospital Acquired Infections” but also poses a major public health hazard by causing pollution of air, water and soil. Objective: This study objective was to critically analyze current waste management system in Bandipur Hospital, Tanahu District, Nepal and critically review the findings. Methods: For the critical analysis on waste management, literature review on hospital waste management was done. The techniques used for critical analysis were observation using observation checklist and interview with hospital manager, doctors, staff nurses, and local people living nearby the hospital. Tool of this critical analysis was SWOT analysis. Results: It can be seen from SWOT analysis that, most of the waste of the hospital is not managed in an appropriate way. Appropriate segregation and disposal of biodegradable and non biodegradable, infectious and non-infectious wastes is important to avoid health hazards caused by poor waste management such as vector borne diseases, pollution of air, water and soil contamination. In Bandipur Hospital, waste disposal is not according to WHO standard. Physical infrastructures do not meet the requirements. Available dustbins are not according to WHO color coding, no basin at Emergency room, no trolley to carry waste and open dumping practice. The reason behind most of these problems is the management of the hospital, staffs of the hospital and the stakeholders who are not giving any attention to proper waste management process. The other reason beyond this is inadequate budget allocation for waste management in the hospital. Conclusion: If the waste management of the hospital is done properly, environment of the hospital will become clean and hospital can provide quality health services to the patient. For this there is necessity of strong committment from the hospital management, the hospital staffs, hospital development committee and the Government.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/22961/19517,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

For the developing country like Nepal having diverse societal arrangements, land tenure system plays important role in economic, social and political structure. As Nepal is in the process of implementing federalization, assessment of land tenure security shall be one of the instruments for developing new land related policies and assessing the effect of new policies afterward. The objective of this paper is to perform SWOT analysis on the status of land tenure security in Nepal by reviewing the history of the tenure system and current tenure system, studying country reports and research papers and analyzing policies and institutions. The study shows that despite some initiatives by government, NGOs, bilateral agencies and media to improve land tenure security, land tenure insecurity prevails in all areas of the country even in registered lands. It is found that stable  rganization, registration of most of the built-up and cultivated land, advocacy to protect the right of landless has strengthened the land tenure security. However, the tenure rights of socially and economically disadvantaged people and displaced people from disasters have not been properly addressed and those people are at high risk of eviction from the place they are living. The study recommends that land tenure insecurity arising from political, legislative and organizational behavior should be managed by appropriate interventions and policy reforms.

The favorable government policies and peaceful native people of the Nepal Himalaya have welcomed thousands of tourists, trekkers and researchers to fulfill their various aspirations and interests. However, the country is often blamed for causing the so-called eco-crisis in the region. During the 1970s and 1980s, publishing several books and articles with attractive titles, some mountain experts showed solidarity with those who propounded a hypothetical theory of Himalayan environmental degradation on the basis of the limited samples collected from a few localities.

In the countries of South-East Asia region, Kala-azar occurs mainly in three countries- India, Bangladesh and Nepal. The disease occurs in agricultural villages where houses are frequently constructed with mud walls. Even people residing in endemic areas have poor practices for its prevention. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 150 community people of Katahari Gaupalika, Morang. Simple Random sampling technique was used for the selection of three wards among seven wards, probability proportionate was used for the selection of the population from the ward. The desired sample was selected purposively. Data were collected from face-to-face interview techniques using a structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done by using SPSS 16 version. Results It is found that nearly two-thirds of the respondents (63.3%) had moderate awareness, more than one-fifth (22%) of the respondents had adequate awareness while (14.7%) of the respondents had inadequate awareness of Kala-azar. Similarly, more than half (55.3%) had moderate preventive practice, (25.3%) had inadequate preventive practice and nearly one-fifth (19.3%) had adequate preventive practice. The mean score for awareness and practice was 16.633 and 5.54 respectively. Conclusion The study was conducted to assess the level of awareness of Kala-azar. This concluded moderate awareness of respondents on Kala-azar which suggested that there is still a need to improve the awareness of the respondents particularly on its causative agent, preventive measures and complication. However, to improve their awareness to an adequate level, awareness-raising programs focusing on preventive practice should be conducted",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Methods: We used the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) dataset in this analysis. According to World Health Organization (WHO), pneumonia is diagnosed in under five population as having cough and / or difficult breathing, with / without fever. We considered pneumonia if at least two of these symptoms were present.

We assessed the association between pneumonia and other categorical variables using chi-square test and compared means using independent samples t-test. Results: In bivariate analysis, wealth index, use of drug for intestinal parasite and history of diarrhea in past two weeks had statistically significant association in occurrence of pneumonia in children under five years of age. However, in multivariate analysis, occurrence of pneumonia was 1.78 times higher in children with history of recent diarrhea after controlling for wealth index and drug for intestinal parasite.

The river is suffering from streambank instability causing great threat to the infrastructure, land and settlement areas. In this context, assessment of Bank Stability and Toe Erosion Model (BSTEM) of the Kodku Khola was undertaken for eight different sites using the BSTEM version 5.4 that calculates a Factor of Safety (Fs) for multilayer streambank, based on limit equilibrium-method. Streambank of the uppermost reach around the transects BK1 (Lower Badikhel) and BK2 (Upper Taukhel) area is stable, where Fs exceeds 1.3 and maximum lateral retreat of channel is 21.86-30.59 cm with 0.025-0.290 m2 of the total eroded area of the bank-toe resulting in less bank toe erosion. Canopy and understorey cover with consolidated bank materials are the causes of stable banks. Streambank of transects BK3 (Arubot) and BK4 (Thaiba) are unstable as Fs ranges from 0.75 to 0.92, and the maximum lateral retreat of channel ranges 70.83-208.81 cm with total eroded bank toe area of 0.117–1.695 m2 resulting in excessive bank toe erosion problems. Major causes of instability are the presence of unconsolidated bank material, high scouring, and sparse riparian vegetation. Within the transects BK6 and BK7 around Harisiddhi, streambanks are stable with less bank toe erosion hazard because of channelization. Where the Fs are low and banks are disturbed by encroachment, suitable bioengineering measures can be implemented to mitigate excessive bank toe erosion and failure.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/22870/19435,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The basic elements of environmental justice movements can be traced back to social movements of several decades ago – whether passive or active. In the past, collective action represented mainly a concern for access to land and other natural resources for the survival of marginalized groups that included women, lower castes, and indigenous peoples. In the repressive Rana and Panchayat regimes prior to 1990, resistance was passive or just symbolic, and movements were sporadic and localized. However, particularly since 1990, as urbanization and industrialization increased along with the use of chemicals and other substances, some of which are also detrimental to human health, social movements have also been organized to resist the maldistribution of new pollutants and hazardous substances in the society affecting the poor as well as socio-politically and culturally marginalized and oppressed.",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

However, this foodstuff may be contaminated with heavy metals from the raw ingredients, production, and packaging methods, which could bring serious health issues. Therefore, this study aimed to determine cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (FAAS) in a total of thirty-seven different brands of milk-based, cocoa-based, and sugar-based chocolates available in local grocery shops of Kathmandu city, Nepal and to evaluate associated health risks in children and adults using USEPA deterministic approaches. The results revealed concentrations of Cd, Ni, and Pb in the range of 0.021 – 0.585, 1.90 – 7.24, and 0.57 – 4.29 mg/kg respectively in studied chocolates and an overall mean concentration of 0.199, 4.22, and 1.94 mg/kg respectively. The observed concentrations exceeded the maximum permissible limits set by FAO/WHO (2001). A higher concentration of all studied metals was found in cocoa-based chocolate compared to milk-based and sugar-based chocolates. The positive and significant correlations (p < 0.05) among Cd, Ni, and Pb in studied chocolates indicate the possibility of contamination from common sources. Similarly, the estimated ADDing values were higher for all metals in cocoa-based chocolate for both children and adults. However, children were more prone to metals exposure than adults since their dietary intake was higher than adults. Cocoa-based chocolate in this study posed a non-carcinogenic risk to both children and adults since their hazard index (HI) values exceeded the acceptable limit (>1.0). In addition, Cd and Ni posed carcinogenic risks to both receptor groups through the consumption of all three categories of chocolate. Therefore, this study suggested the use of less contaminated raw materials in chocolates as well as regular monitoring of the production chain as an attempt to ensure the quality and safety of the food products.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNCS/article/download/62680/47334,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Given that Nepal seeks to add several hydropower plants to the Integrated National Power System (INPS) in the next few years, this type of planning is crucial. To explore potential expansion plans, the 48 hydropower plants (20 of which are currently operating) within 18 hydro networks and two diesel plants are included, and different options such as the possibility of export, seasonal variations in hydrology, and projected growth rates in gross domestic product are considered. The results illustrate the long run marginal cost (LRMC) and loss of load probability (LoLP) through 2030 in Nepal. It is found that LRMC is 3.50 Nepali Rupees per kilowatt hour at 4.1% of average LoLP. While scrutinizing the results, it is found that LoLP is higher in early stage of projections due to generation capacity limitations from 2014 to 2016. However, by the end of 2017, the LRMC and LoLP begin to decrease significantly. On this premise, the model suggests to introduce large storage plants for hydropower generation and export of that excess energy. Furthermore, a proper implementation of proposed peaking and storage plants to meet rising demand can offset the need to obtain electricity through more expensive and less environmentally-friendly means such as thermal/diesel plants.HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water, Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 19Page: 45-51",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/15352/12413,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The data was analyzed and chi square test was done (p value<0.05) to see the association between medical students and their mind-set towards self medication. Results: Among the total respondents, 80.8% thought that self medication was a part of self-care and 89.4% planned to continue self medication, 47.1% of them reported that they would advise their friends to stop practicing self medication, 70% reported having a registered medical practitioner with permission to prescribe medicines within 5-9 minutes walking distance from their abode, whereas around 1% reported that they self medicated so that they would not disturb the practioners. From the total, 6.7% presented with some side effects and had to visit the hospital Conclusions: High incidence of self medication among undergraduate medical students might be able to sense false entitlement of almost being a doctor with authority to prescribe soon.",https://nmj.com.np/nmj/index.php/nmj/article/download/67/52,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

As time pass by, new emerging health problems, shifting of epidemiological trends in disease patterns, rapid increase in population, new and emerging health problems, increasing commercial interests of private health sector and shrinking resources all contribute in inequity to health care.2  Hence it is extremely important that research addresses priorities and focuses on the most important health issues and conditions. Research must serve as a driver for health system, policies and practice. For this to happen, the health research systems should be fully accountable for sake of transparency and also have to be capable of delivering the desired returns. We are fortune to take benefit from documented experiences from history. The main goal of medical research article is to share one’s valuable experience so as to contribute to the progress of science.3  Conducting a medical research and publishing it in a medical journal, is sharing an important knowledge and experience to the world. A physician from one part of the world may have significant load of certain disease and sharing management experience in that particular disease may help doctors of other part of the world treat such kind of patient. Furthermore, author may also have individual benefits, like higher positions in academic hierarchy.4  The Journal of the institution reflects the academics wealth of the institute. Earlier, only few used to grab opportunities for professional growth via publication, majority of them suffer to lack of publication culture in the institution resulting in fossilization of their professional caliber.5  In developing countries like ours, to do quality medical research is often difficult. Furthermore, getting the article published in medical journal is another challenge. Leading international medical journals underreport on health research priorities for developing countries because of improper material, methods quality. Many factors play role in the paucity of inclusion of research papers from developing countries. Lack of resources like funding, proper man power and less access to scientific literature in similar setting leading to poor research output, faulty manuscript preparation and language proficiency may be the common problems. Inadequate laboratory facilities and training may be the other cause. Hence, researchers in developing countries should be supported and encouraged to produce material of the quality by proper guidance and required trainings. Open access journal is the window to the research world. It is one of the tools to increase publications. These journals facilitate the publication of local research output and may play defining role in helping researcher to improve their publication records, and make it accessible to other researchers. This type of open access journal is an important entity in national publishing that will hopefully gain broader prominence as awareness increases and the above efforts are implemented. To make our journal an index and of international stature is strenuous but with the help from our fraternity, we will surely reach the goal soon. Our journal will surely serve as a medium to access information, updated knowledge and a symbol of ideal journal in Nepal.  This journal is the result of hard work, dedication and sacrifice. We apologize for taking this extra long time to publish but as they say ‘good things come to those who wait’ we proudly present you our journal, our masterpiece. No one is to be blamed for the delay of this process. Working with teachers, selecting experts for review, suggesting authors, verifying manuscripts, editing and proof reading was an arduous job but was done meticulously. We run out of words to express our gratitude to the reviewers who reviewed and upgraded the journal’s contents. It is very hard to imagine this journal with their crucial help and guidance. We apologize for not being able to incorporate all the articles due to some academic standards and expectations.  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Angel Magar, without whom this journal would be impossible.

The related wave of research has thus turned to analysis of the dynamics of contentious politics from a comparative perspective. Unfortunately, these studies use country level datasets for their analysis, creating a mismatch between the original actor-based theoretical framework and the empirical conceptualization of contentious collective action. We discuss the conceptual challenges this theoretical-empirical gap generates and highlight how contentious dynamics can be studied with a bottom-up sub-national approach. To do so, we present a new fine-grained dataset of contentious collective action in post-conflict Nepal (2007 to 2010). We descriptively show how this type of data can help us improve our understanding of repertoires of contentious politics.

It thrives through humor clubs, comedy shows, and festivals; the most prominent and longest-lasting festival is Gaijatra (the Cow Festival), which has lent itself well to cartooning. Indeed, it is remarkable that cartooning has endured, and even made advancements, given the topsy-turvy world of Nepalese government and politics. However, as the chapter shows, cartoonists faced some harrowing situations in the closing years of the millennium, when there were many changes of political administration, a Maoist military movement, and emergency periods.

It is the most common cause of unilateral corneal blindness which is a major public health concern for developing countries. Incidence of microbial keratitis in Nepal is higher (799/100000 per year) compared to developed countries like United States (11/100000 per year) due to varying epidemiological factors. Early clinical diagnosis, initiation of proper antibiotic therapy, identification of causative microorganism and management of predisposing factors together are necessary for rapid recovery and prevention of severe visual loss.  Methods: This was a retrospective study of all consecutive patients diagnosed with suspected microbial keratitis and subjected to corneal scrapping in Cornea Department of Rapti Eye Hospital who attended during November 2021 to October 2022. The major outcome measures studied were predisposing factors, microbial spectrum, antibiotic sensitivity, treatment outcomes and surgical interventions required. Results: A total of 68 eyes of 68 cases diagnosed with microbial keratitis and subjected to corneal scrapping were enrolled in the study. Mean age of the study participants was 49.6 ± 19.6 years and male to female ratio was 1.96:1. Ocular trauma was the most common predisposing factor (48.5% of cases) followed by use of steroid. Culture was positive in 36.8% of cases of which bacterial isolates were more common than fungal isolates. Streptococcus pneumoniae (37%) and Fusarium species (44.44%) were most common organisms among the bacterial and fungal isolates respectively.  Conclusions: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Fusarium species are the most common bacterial and fungal species causing microbial keratitis in the mid-western region of Nepal with ocular trauma being the commonest predisposing factor. Cefazolin and fluoroquinolones are most effective antibiotics for Gram positive and Gram negative organisms.  ",https://nmj.com.np/nmj/index.php/nmj/article/download/157/156,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The prevalence of malocclusion is highly variable and its range is very wide and heterogeneous. Aims and Objectives: To assess the prevalence of various malocclusion traits and to evaluate the orthodontic treatment need based on the Dental Health Component (DHC) of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) among the patients visiting the College of Medical Sciences (COMS), Bharatpur, Chitwan. Materials and Method: A total of 530 patients visiting dental OPD, College of Medical Sciences, Bharatpur, Chitwan were included in this study among which 288 were male and 242 were female patients. Out of the total 530 subjects, malocclusion was observed in 359 individuals. Therefore, all subsequent results and fidings reported in the study are based on these 359 subjects exclusively. Intraoral examination was carried out to assess malocclusion based on Angle’s classifiation, overjet, overbite, open bite, crowding, spacing, and crossbite. The statistical test employed in the study was the Chi-Square test, which was utilized to assess the presence of a signifiant difference. Result: The present study showed that Class I (55.2%), malocclusion  was most prevalent followed by Class II (40.9%) and then Class III (3.9%).

The aim of the research presented in this paper is to assess physicochemical parameters of spring water, understand their seasonal and spatial variation and the factors controlling the variation. Physicochemical parameters were correlated with each other to understand the processes and an attempt has been made to understand groundwater processes studying the physicochemical parameters. Groundwater is slightly acidic to slightly alkaline with pH ranging from 5.5 to 7.5 and is weakly to very weakly mineralized with EC range of 21.6–234.0 μS/cm in pre-monsoon and 10.5–189.8 μS/cm in post-monsoon. TDS ranged between 5.3–116.9 mg/l and 10.8–94.9 mg/l, DO between 3.1–9.4 mg/l and 2.4–7.3 mg/l and groundwater temperature between 18.4–27.9°C and 19.2–27.4°C in pre-monsoon and post monsoon season respectively. TDS and EC are noted to be higher in pre-monsoon whereas pH, DO and temperature are comparatively higher in post-monsoon. The south-east region of the study area shows minimum groundwater temperature. Minimum concentration of EC and TDS were observed in south-east and north-west part of the study area with values increasing towards the river valley. Groundwater temperature shows inverse relation with elevation, pH and DO while correlated with EC and TDS of groundwater in the region. The measured parameters were seasonally and spatially variable. The results indicate difference for measured physicochemical parameters mainly caused due to results generated by cumulative interactions of monsoonal rain, atmospheric temperature, rock-groundwater interaction, residence time of groundwater and seasonal influences. The change in parameters with respect to elevation and relation between different parameters shows shallow aquifer-related groundwater processes.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57917/43296,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Many of them are living in the temporary or semi-permanent structure of dwelling on the bank of the river Bagmati and its tributaries. A traumatic experience of an unprecedented decade long armed conflict in Nepal between government security force and Maoist insurgents between 1996-2005 forced people migrate to the safer zones for their livelihood security, particularly in the urban areas like Kathmandu. As a consequence an increase in landlessness, joblessness, homelessness, livelihood insecurity, and disruption of the social fabric have been noticed. Now the country is in the post-conflict phase. This study, therefore, seeks to explore coping strategies of the poor people residing in Kathmandu in post-conflict phase by using primary data collected from sampled household based on multi-stage sampling procedures. Livelihood of the poor people is highly influenced by the armed conflict in the past. But the post-conflict phase is characterized by increasing mobility, expanding knowledge and opportunities.

Although breastfeeding is almost universal in Nepal, ranges of regional differences in timely initiation of breastfeeding have been documented. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalance and the determinants of early initiation of breastfeeding among disadvantaged ethnic women in Midwest Nepal. Methods: The data was obtained from a household survey of women who had their last child less than one year of age. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze respondents’ demographic, socioeconomic, obstetric and health services related characteristics. Determinants of timely initiation of breastfeeding were assessed using univariate analysis and further evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis.Results: Of 362 mothers, 65.5% initiated breastfeeding within one hour of childbirth. Mothers belonging to Tharu ethnic groups (aOR 1.788; 95% CI: 1.014, 3.152), health facility delivery (aOR 3.381; 95% CI: 1.795, 6.369) and mothers who were counseled on breastfeeding during ANC attendance (aOR 2.898; 95% CI: 1.038, 8.096) were more likely to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of child birth. Conclusions: Almost two in every three mothers had initiated breastfeeding within one hour of childbirth. The factors influencing timely initiation of breastfeeding were Tharu ethnic mothers, health facility delivery and Ante Natal Care counseling. We need to aim at increasing institutional deliveries and counseling during ANC which may increase the early initiation of breastfeeding among disadvantaged ethnic groups.

The research identifies “Health and Safety risk management” as the most critical factor compared to the other critical components namely supply chain operation, contractual and construction financial market. This research focuses on utilizing systematic partial least squares structural equation modeling to assess the effect of COVID-19 lockdown. Further, it seeks to demonstrate the direct relationships between COVID-19 effects and the critical factors that have been affected as a result of the pandemic. The study considers these factors as essential components in assessing the overall impact of COVID-19. This study attempts to evaluate and examine the significant pandemic effects on building construction projects. Nepal-based construction firms, government agencies, and non-government organizations were surveyed to identify critical factors affected by COVID-19 in building projects. The quantitative design method of this study included the use of smart partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), one of the statistical tools. Information like the fundamentals of the project, its state, etc., have been considered. 104 valid responses were received out of 130 questionnaires distributed supported at less than 1 % significance level. The inner structural model analysis, with a highest value of 7.014 and a beta value of 0.474, highlights the significance of the relationship between safety and risk management factors and COVID-19 effect in building construction projects.

Coarse rice varieties dominate Nepal’s rice processing industry, with a 42% share by total weight, followed by medium rice (34%) and fine varieties (less than 7%). Polished white rice (Arwa) was the dominant rice type in Nepal in the survey, followed by parboiled and steamed rice. The price and profit margins increased from coarse to fine rice varieties and from Arwa to parboiled and steamed rice. The cost of milling also followed a similar trend. The rice milling industry in Nepal largely influences the adoption or non-adoption of any specific type of rice variety by dictating specific brands in the market and this has important implications for rice research and development. The rice processing industry of Nepal was unable to compete with the Indian rice milling industry because of: 1) low profit margins due to the high cost of rice production and procurement, 2) a lack of economies of scale, 3) a lack of milling technologies for long and extra-long and steamed rice in the country and a lack of investment to modernize rice milling technology, and 4) unavailability of paddy throughout the year locally. Millers were willing to upgrade their rice milling technology to include high throughput parboiling, steamed rice as well as long and extra-long grain rice.

Developing an efficient transport network functioning in allweather conditions and resilience hydropower is not possible without the construction of tunnels. The experience indicates that the construction cost for tunnels is considerably higher due to insufficient capacity and knowledge base within Nepal and dependency on foreign agencies who have limited knowledge on the Himalayan geological condition.

The study analyzed data from commercial banks over a wide time range from 2001 to 2023, utilizing the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model technique. The study found that bank size, funding risk, liquidity risk, and GDP growth have a positive and significant impact on bank stability in Nepal. The study also found that credit risk has a negative impact on bank stability. This implies that higher levels of credit risk increase the likelihood of bank instability in Nepal. Banks must give utmost priority to effectively managing and controlling bank size, funding risk, liquidity risk, and fostering GDP growth in order to bolster bank stability and fortify the country's financial system.

The author conducted detailed geological studies and mineral exploration in some of the copper and polymetallic prospects and also reviewed the literature related to copper prospects in Nepal. The present research is able to delineate two distinct copper ore mineralization belts extending from west to east and identify the promising sites for copper ore and polymetallic mineralization that could be feasible for mining. The northern mineralization belt lies close to the Main Central Thrust where the mineralization occurs mostly in metamorphic rocks of garnet amphibolite facies in Darchula,Bajhang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Solukhumbu and Ilam districts. The southern mineralization belt in the Lesser Himalaya occurs in low-grade metamorphic rocks of greenschist facies in Dadeldhura, Rukum, Baglung, Myagdi, Tanahun, Dhadhing, Makwanpur, Dolakha, Udaypur, Bhojpur and Ilam districts. Most of these prospects were locally exploited on a small scale by traditional mining before 1951. Almost all mineralization in both belts is related to hydrothermal dissemination, irregular multiple vein type, replacement and cavity fillings and only a few polymetallic mineralizations at the exo-contact zone of granite bodies. The ore minerals were concentrated during the processes of regional metamorphism at the time of Himalayan upheaval. In general, the copper content in the northern belt appears to be higher in grade and tonnage as compared to the southern belt. The frequent association of tungsten, molybdenum, bismuth, nickel, tin, lead, zinc ores and traces of gold suggests the urgent need for further detailed exploration and evaluation of selected prospects which could be economic deposits and feasible for mining.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57919/43295,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Canal lining determines the cost of project to a great extent but also the discharge delivery efficiency of the irrigation system. Though earthen canal sections are least expensive, simple to maintain and environmentally friendly, they have high seepage rates and demand frequent repair. In the light of need for resource conservation and the general unavailability of labour for maintenance work, a canal lining, though more expensive, may be justifiable in the long run. Technological advances in the construction have made available lighter and more affordable materials that enhance many parts of the irrigation process.It is the private sector that should lead the development of these technologies as they relate to the construction business. We can look to foreign markets to see how canal lining technologies have improved the use of this tool in various environments and soils. In the Nepali context, we use traditional lining techniques like stone or reinforced concrete, which are effective in the plains, but less so in the hills and remote.

However, considering the large volumes of spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed for low back pain and/or radiculopathy, this has become the prime problems in all spinal care facilities in Nepal. Spinal MRIs constitute approximately sixty percent of the MRI performed in the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH). This study is being conducted to review the pattern of degeneration of lumbosacral spine in patients referred for MRI at TUTH. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at TUTH. Patients with low back pain and or radiculopathy undergoing MRI in the previous 5 months were included in the study. Patients with trauma and or conditions other than degenerative processes were excluded in the study. The findings were recorded and analyzed using SPSS. Results: A total of 301 patients were included in the study. Age ranged from 16 to 83 years, mean age being 42 years. Highest number of patients were in the 30-40 years age group (26.2%). Male to female ratio was 1.22. Disc bulge was the most common finding, seen in 77.7% followed by protrusion (58.5%), extrusion (3.9%) and sequestration (0.3%). Foraminal stenosis (68.4%) was the most common complication followed by central canal stenosis (51.8%) and nerve root compression (37.8%). Disc protrusion was the most significant (p<0.05) predictor of complications (nerve root compression, foraminal stenosis and central canal stenosis). Conclusion: The study shows that degenerative disc diseases remain the cause of morbidity in the most productive years of life (30-40 years of age). Large volumes of MRIs performed for this condition represent significant economic and healthcare burden in a developing country like Nepal as well.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/719/661,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Available data were collected from the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MoAD), Department of Agriculture (DoA) and Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC). Green house gas emission (GHG) was estimated by using IPCC 2006 guidelines. Agricultural activities contribute directly to emissions of greenhouse gases through a variety of processes including the source categories such as enteric fermentation in domestic livestock, livestock manure management, rice cultivation, and agricultural soil management. Diverse traditional agriculture systems, unique diversities in land types and unavailability of required disaggregated data at the national level as defined by the emission factor data base (EFDB) of the IPCC 2006, were the problem encountered while calculating the emission status in this study. Annual methane (CH4) emission from paddy fields ranged from 111.57 to 133.07 Gg over years 2000 to 2010 but it was found lowest ( 111.57 Gg) in the year 2002 and highest (133.07 Gg) in the year2003. In the year 2010, methane emission from paddy cultivation represented about 17.48 % of cumulative methane emission both from livestock sector and paddy fields throughout Nepal.

The aim of this review is to identify the goals, interventions, and effectiveness of major infant mortality prevention programs around the country. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. The literature search revealed six programs that Nepal has utilized to combat infant mortality. The Community Based Management of Childhood Illness (CB-IMCI) program utilizes specially trained community workers to help identify and treat children with common childhood illnesses. The National Neonatal Health Strategy (NNHS) links families to the community and then to the broader healthcare system, with success found in its referral system. The Safe Delivery Incentives Program (SDIP) has found success with monetizing safe delivery practices, and shown an increase in safe deliveries with skilled healthcare workers present. Free Newborn Care (FNC) services were aimed at treating sick newborns for free, but ongoing concerns for program sustainability have led to further revision. The Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) is another plan aimed at preventing newborn deaths through improving health system administration and finances, but with limited efficacy data, it is hard to determine its success due to the lack of objective benchmark markers and data collected. Finally, the Birth Preparedness Package (BPP) is a highly efficacious program that encourages communities to plan for pregnancies by planning for delay barriers. Nepal has made significant strides in reducing infant mortality; however, much work still needs to be done.

Using household survey data from the Bharatpur Metropolitan City of Nepal, we find that women are more likely to segregate waste at the source and also manage degradable waste at home better. Still, there is no gender difference in selling plastic and paper waste. In contrast, women are more likely to give paper or plastic waste either to the waste collectors (free) or throw away, suggesting a heterogeneity across gender when it comes to managing household waste.

Sadly, developing countries have a much higher rate of accidents and fatalities on construction sites, often up to three times more than developed nations like the USA, Japan, and the UK. Despite the growing awareness of human values and safety management systems in the industrialized countries, the same cannot be said for developing countries such as Nepal, which lack appropriate safety measures. Occupational safety and health in Nepal is in dire need of improvement. Current practices are inadequate for promoting and protecting the health and safety of workers. Despite the existence of laws, their implementation is lacking, and safety standards are absent. Furthermore, the increasing complexity and sophistication of technology, as well as the demand for advanced skills in the workforce, require new approaches to safety management in construction firms, projects, and sites. However, traditional techniques and manual labor still dominate safety practices. This is mainly due to the high cost of implementing safety measures, which contractors perceive as outweighing the cost of non-compliance with the law. We will explore the existing laws and regulations related to occupational safety and health in Nepal's construction industry and evaluate their effectiveness in promoting and protecting the health and safety of workers.

Grounded in longitudinal data from the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey from 1996 to 2022, this study aims to shed light on evolving patterns in pregnancy outcomes and inequities in use of abortion services across ecological zones and wealth quintiles.Methods: Utilizing six rounds of Nepal Demographic and Health Survey data, pregnancy outcomes were categorized as abortion, delivery, miscarriage, or stillbirth. Income-related inequality in the utilization of abortion services was assessed through the concentration index, ranging from -1 to 1. Trends over time were evaluated using the annual rate of change.Results: The ARC indicated a substantial rise in induced abortion rates, surging from 0.4% in 1996 to 8.8% in 2022. In contrast, live births witnessed a decline from 92.8% to 81.2%. Significant variations were observed across ecological zones and wealth quintiles, with the Mountain zone and the Poorest group experiencing the most pronounced increases in induced abortion rates. By 2022, the concentration index reached a near-zero value, signifying a near-elimination of income-related disparities in the use of induced abortion services.Discussion: The findings suggest that while there has been significant progress in access to and use of abortion services in Nepal, particularly post-2002 policy shifts, challenges remain. Women from lower socio-economic backgrounds continue to face barriers, indicating the need for a multi-pronged approach to address residual challenges.Conclusions: Nepal has made remarkable strides in enhancing equitable access to and use of induced abortion services, but more needs to be done to guarantee equitable access for all women. Future efforts should focus on policy reforms, infrastructural improvements, and societal change to eliminate existing barriers to reproductive healthcare.Keywords: Abortion services; concentration Index; socio-economic disparities.",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Periodization of history in Nepal establishes a direct and necessary link between modern Nepal and its national territory. Indeed, the beginning of the modern era is determined by the “unification” of the fifty independent kingdoms and tribal territories that gave birth to the anational territory of Nepal during the second half of the 18th century. Such a correspondence makes modernity and the unified territory of Nepal coincide in a single space time. Yet, a closer examination of the logic behind periodization sheds light on its Kathmandu-centric, and dynastic perspective. This resulted in the formation of a hybrid conception of the national territory and of its center of power. From being the standard of the territory’s time and space, the Kathmandu Valley became the chronotope of the historical narrative dealing with the first half of the 19th century. It continued to form the territory’s remarkable center following the seizing of power by the Rana prime ministers (1846–1951), but now by assuming a futurist dimension, which conversely, plunged the rest of the country back in time.</p>",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Addressing this gap in competency assessment is crucial for safe and effective mental health service integration in primary care. To explore competency, this study describes a training and supervision program for 206 health workers in Uganda, Liberia, and Nepal in humanitarian settings impacted by political violence, Ebola, and natural disasters. Health workers were trained in the World Health Organization’s mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP). Health workers demonstrated changes in knowledge (mhGAP knowledge, effect size, d = 1.14), stigma (Mental Illness: Clinicians’ Attitudes, d = −0.64; Social Distance Scale, d = −0.31), and competence (ENhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic factors, ENACT, d = 1.68). However, health workers were only competent in 65% of skills. Although the majority were competent in communication skills and empathy, they were not competent in assessing physical and mental health, addressing confidentiality, involving family members in care, and assessing suicide risk. Higher competency was associated with lower stigma (social distance), but competency was not associated with knowledge. To promote competency, this study recommends (1) structured role-plays as a standard evaluation practice; (2) standardized reporting of competency, knowledge, attitudes, and clinical outcomes; and (3) shifting the field toward competency-based approaches to training and supervision.",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Crustal thickening led to partial melting and formation of leucogranite melts along the top of the GHS, from earlier muscovite dehydration to later biotite dehydration melting with time. The granite was not a diapiric intrusion and does not intrude across the STD low-angle normal fault. A low-angle, north-dipping normal fault, the ductile-brittle Nar-Phu detachment wraps around the top of the Manaslu leucogranite and truncates all leucogranites in the footwall. The detachment formed the roof fault during exhumation of footwall rocks (channel flow) along the upper GHS during the early-middle Miocene. Metamorphism is also entirely regional and not contact metamorphism. U-Th/Pb monazite ages from metapelites show semi-continuous metamorphism across the GHS from ~35-15 Ma. The leucogranites were emplaced as layer-parallel sills entirely within the GHS between ~25-18.5 Ma. U-Th/Pb monazite dates from the Manaslu leucogranites suggest two major intrusion phases at 22.5 Ma (Larke-la phase) and 19.5 Ma (Bimtang phase). The sheeted sill complex was emplaced by progressive underplating with the oldest intrusions structurally above the younger ones. The migmatite melt source was likely buried further to the north. GHS rocks structurally beneath the Manaslu granite show few leucogranite dykes. Heat for granite melting was entirely internally derived radioactive heating from crustal thickening, and had no frictional heat input from the Main Central thrust >10-15 km structurally below the base of the leucogranite sheeted sill complex.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57738/43181,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Niche specific commodities that have comparative advantage could be produced in fair quantity to meet the demand of huge market of neighboring India and China as purchasing capacity of people in those countries has improved markedly mainly for quality agriculture commodities. Trade deficit, food insecurity, income generation, poverty reduction, and employment generation could be addressed by turning present status of subsistence agriculture into robust, vibrant and commercial agriculture through technology led agro-industrialization. There are agro-commodities which are imported from India and other countries in huge quantity by the scarce hard currency earned through remittance. Evidence shows that almost 70% of the remittance is spent for agriculture commodities which have high potentiality to produce within the country even after local consumption. Such produce could be exported to other countries to mitigate trade imbalance, enhance export promotion and import reduction and promote graduating Nepal from LDC to DC within the stipulated time frame as proposed a couple of years ago by the government of Nepal. Nepal should come up with functional, pragmatic and implementable agriculture plan and policy to harness huge possibility of agriculture commercialization to meet the consumption demand per se within and outside the country.

This paper aims to analyze the constraints and opportunities of vegetable farmers in Kirtipur. Altogether 80 farm household survey were conducted in four major areas of Kirtipur. A total of 20 key informant interviews (KII) were also conducted to understand the perception of farm households on commercial vegetable farming. The result shows that around 94% of the total sampled farm households have leasehold farmland that has spread to different settlements of Kirtipur Municipality. Out of total leasehold farmers, 69% have written agreement with the landowner. The result also shows that the farmers cultivate vegetables in an average area of 5.67 ropani (2884.49m2). Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) are the primary vegetable products, whereas cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) and other green leafy vegetables are mostly cultivated as secondary vegetable products. Dug wells are the major sources of irrigation on vegetable farmland. Out of the total sampled farm households, about 42% of farmers are associated with farmers group and 37% have basic training on vegetable farming. Majority of farmers have savings from vegetable production and marketing. Despite few constraints like price fluctuation (81%) and high middleman margins (71%), vegetable farming in Kirtipur has many opportunities particularly being a major source income and livelihood (93%), self-employment generation (87%) and growing market demand (83%). The opportunities in commercial vegetable farming have continuously attracted the farmers in Kirtipur; however, the existing constraints has deprived farmers from their expected returns. Therefore, this paper recommends to portray possible options to promote opportunities and overcome the existing constraints to retain commercial vegetable farming as a sustainable source for farm households in Kirtipur.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23418/19847,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Firstly, people displaced due to conflict, primarily Maoist insurgency. Significant to this IDP population is the fact that the vast majorities are from the Brahmin/Chettri ethnic group, which has long dominated landholding, government service and political power in Nepal (more than 90% of government servants were of Brahmin/Chettri ethnicity prior to 1990, and the percentage increased during the rule of the 'democratically-elected' parties).The displacement of people of Brahmin/Chettri ethnicity is reflected in the ethnicities of the children investigated in this study. The second and largest group of internally displaced persons are the collateral victims of the armed conflict, primarily poor villagers who have fled their home land due to general insecurity, degradation of the local economy and services, food scarcity, fear of abduction by the Maoists, or fear of harassment and violence by either the Maoists or the government's security forces (including the national police, Armed Police Force and Nepalese Army). This group includes a wide range of rural castes and ethnicities. The internal displacement of villagers has not been chaotic and random, however. These IDPs have generally followed routes already established by rural-to-urban labour migration, settling in destinations and finding employment with the assistance of already-migrated family and community members. The third groups of IDPs due to the armed conflict are youth, primarily boys and young men above the age of 12. These youth have fled due to fear of abduction and recruitment by Maoist forces or fear of harassment and violence by Maoists or security forces (or both).

The Tamakoshi basin is a trans-boundary river that originates from Tibet and flows through Dolakha and Ramechap districts before joining the Sapta Koshi river. Few studies exist in Nepal attempting to quantify the erosion rate and susceptibility. However, they are scattered and mainly focus on either rill-sheet erosion or landslide only. Hence, this study attempted to estimate slope erosion by applying the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), and soil and debris erosion from landslide (2000-2019). Spatially distributed erosion intensity maps derived from the RUSLE model, as well as index-based landslide susceptibility map, were integrated to capture both running water and gravity erosion processes. The novelty of this research is that it examined the soil erosion rate using a process-based model as well as from the soil or rock displaced by the observed landslides over the last 20 years. The study estimated gross annual erosion by running water of 9.1million tons/yr, equivalent to the denudation rate of 3.34 mm/yr. Of these, landslide erosion accounts for 7.6 million ton/yr, i.e., 2.88 mm/yr, this covers about 84% of total slope erosion. High landslide and erosion potential areas are associated with high rainfall, steep slopes, scarps, lower segment of valley side slopes, high relief, and highly fractured and deformed parts of high-grade metamorphic rocks, such as gneiss, quartzite, marbles, migmatite, and granitic gneiss.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/35548/27790,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

It has a high prevalence in the population and is associated with high morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Here, we aimed to study the socio-demographic profiles, etiologies of CKD and associated co-morbidities in patients attending a referral hospital. Methods: We conducted a hospital based, descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study among adult patients with CKD attending Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH), Kathmandu. Patients younger than 16 years and renal allograft recipients were excluded from the study. A diagnosis of CKD was established by the treating nephrologist based on KDIGO 2012 clinical practice guideline. Prior informed consent was taken. Data was collected on clinical features, socio-demographic profiles, major co-morbidities, presumed etiology of CKD and hematological and biochemical parameters of the patients. SPSS version 24 (Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the analysis of data. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Institute of Medicine (IOM). Results: A total of 401 patients with CKD were included in the study. The mean age of the patient was 50.92 years (SD=17.98), male to female ratio was 1.8:1. Among these patients, 86% were Hindu, 24.4% were farmers, 57% were from the Hilly region of Nepal, 51% were active smokers, and 51.6% were alcohol consumers. Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) (36.2%; n= 145), diabetes mellitus (31.9%; n= 128) and hypertension (21.7%; n=87) were the three most common identified causes of CKD. Among the biopsy proven CGN patients, IgA nephropathy was the most common cause. In a large proportion of patients (68.3%) cause of CGN was not known. Most of the patients were in CKD stage 5 (27%), and stage 5D (55.8%). Coronary artery disease (CAD) (in 7% patients), heart failure (in 2.7%) and stroke (in 2.2%) were the most common comorbidities. Anemia was prevalent in CKD from stage 3 onwards, the severity increased with increasing stage (p <0.001). Hemodialysis was the predominant mode of renal replacement therapy (RRT) used by 98.2% of CKD 5D patients. Conclusion: Nepalese patients of CKD are younger; males are more affected than females. CGN, diabetes and hypertension are three most common causes of CKD; IgA nephropathy is the most common cause of biopsy proven CGN leading to CKD. Anemia is common from CKD stage 3 onwards.

The government has been spending a significant portion of its budget on imports, and it aims to reduce this dependence by increasing domestic production and achieving food security goals. To understand the dynamics of this issue, system dynamics modelling steps were employed. The key variables considered in the model testing were domestic production, imports, per capita consumption, productivity per hectare, and average area expansion rate. The study utilized time series data from 1991 to 2020 and projected the analysis up to 2050 using Stella Architect, a computer-based software program. The findings reveal that both the population and imports have exhibited exponential growth over the years. The model also indicates goal-seeking behaviour, with the government setting targets for yield increment based on available harvest areas. However, the policies implemented thus far have mostly been quick-fix approaches focusing input subsidized programs. According to the model, an increase of 70-100% in rice production will be required by 2050 to meet the growing population's demand. The study presents three policy options for achieving rice self-sufficiency: 1) a 2% annual increase in average area expansion, 2) raising productivity from 3700 kg ha-1 to 5000 kg ha-1 and 3) increasing productivity to 3900 kg ha-1 while reducing per capita rice consumption from 200 kg to 130 kg. The study suggests that adopting the recommended policy implications can help increase rice production in Nepal.

The local people enter the park illegally and exploit the park resources like fodder, firewood, thatch, etc. They also try to kill wildlife either for food as traditional profession or for money. They frequently encounter with wildlife and get injured; sometimes they are killed. Similarly, wildlife cross the park boundary and destroy the crops and kill the livestock. Villagers also get their shelters and sheds damaged by them. BNP, therefore, has introduced various programmes to keep the conservation intact without disturbing the livelihood of Buffer Zone people. Several efforts, such as construction of Trench, Machan etc. have been made to address the issues associated with park people conflicts. In addition, endowment funds, such as Rahat Kosh, Apatkalin Kosh and Chetipurti Kosh have been established to provide and compensate to the human casualty and property (mainly building) damage.The Park-People interaction is the reality and the need is felt from both sides.

In this regard, the study was designed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice behaviour for using as well as prescribing dental floss among the dental interns of Nepal. Methods: An online questionnaire consisting of two sections; the first comprised of the socio- demographic and professional aspects and the second consisted of questions related to knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding the use of dental floss, and its prescription was prepared using Google forms and the link was shared. The data were analysed in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 software. Results: In this study, the participants were familiar with the dental floss, but many lacked awareness regarding its proper use. Ninety-nine (64.3%) of the participants personally used dental floss. Only six (3.9%) never prescribed it to their patients. Among those who prescribed, only 37 (25%) always demonstrated the techniques. Conclusions: The study indicated that many participants used dental floss, however, educating and recommending the patient about it was comparatively low.

This study examines the impact of natural shocks on the adoption and usage of clean cooking fuels focusing on LPG. Using data from the third wave of the Household Risk and Vulnerability Survey 2018, logistic regression is employed to analyze both the likelihood of LPG adoption and household expenditure on LPG under conditions of natural shocks. The findings reveal that households experiencing natural shocks are 5 percent less on average likely to adopt biogas or LPG. Furthermore, household expenditure on LPG decreases by 4.43 percent relative to cooking fuel expenses particularly for firewood by the households experiencing natural shocks. This reduction highlights a decline in the intensity of clean energy use among households concurrently using LPG and firewood. These results underscore the negative effects of natural shocks on the transition to clean cooking fuels posing challenges to achieving sustainable adoption of clean energy solutions.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/73397/56676,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

A feasible generalized least square technique is employed to calculate the vulnerability score, further disaggregated between rural-urban areas, provinces, and major caste/ethnic groups. The findings reveal that thirty-two percent of households are highly vulnerable, indicating that they have higher chances of falling below the poverty line due to death, illness, unemployment, and other household-specific shocks. The paper also finds that Karnali and Sudur Paschim Provinces have higher vulnerability than other provinces. Likewise, Dalits and Muslims have higher vulnerability scores compared to other castes / ethnic groups. The estimation suggests that the poverty incidence and vulnerability scores largely overlap, yet the vulnerability scores are consistently higher among all groups indicating a high risk of households falling into poverty. Therefore, it is desirable that major groups’ vulnerability profile, in addition to poverty profile, should be constructed and aligns the pro-poor policies to the vulnerable groups to mitigate the risks of pushing such vulnerable households below the poverty line.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/48035/35995,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

It may include the use of threat or force. In some cases, the person cannot give consent to sex because he/she is unconscious or otherwise incapacitated. A person may be raped by a stranger, an acquaintance or date or a family member.Methods: The study was a retrospective and descriptive analysis of cases of sexual assault victims examined by the author in the Forensic Medicine departments at Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj and Gandaki Medical College Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal over a period of four years (2012 to 2016). This includes information regarding the age group of the victim at the time of sexual abuse, relationship of the victim to the perpetrator, genital and extra-genital injuries present over the victim’s body and number of cases attended as an expert witness by the author in various courts of Nepal.Results: In the four years period, a total number of 55 cases were examined as sexual assault cases. It was observed that majority were of the 13 - 15 years of age group (46%) followed by <10 years (20%), 16 - 20 years (16%), >20 years (11%) and 10 - 12 years (7%). Regarding the relationship of the victim to the alleged perpetrator, 87% cases (48 out of 55) were related to acquaintances compared to 13% due to strangers. Surprisingly, 3.6% cases (2 out of 48) were due to the biological fathers of the victims. On physical examination of the victim’s body, 36% cases showed genital injuries compared to only 15% with extra genital injuries. The author attended the court as an expert witness in 33% of these cases. Only 7% of the cases were mentally challenged.Conclusion: Young adults remain the most vulnerable group, so education related to sex, morality, humanity and different life skills training should be provided to these groups from their school years itself. The benefits of early intervention and comprehensive care of survivors with the use of standardized protocols along with shorter and lesser traumatic period of court processing to the survivors of these cases should be encouraged.Journal of Gandaki Medical College Volume, 09, Number 2, July December  2016, Page: 43-46",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/17865/14496,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Similarly, 26.67%, 83.33%, 12.5%, 20% and 25% time for the successive contract has been increased by the extension of the contract completion time. From the study, main causes of variation orders are known to be change of plan, change of scope, defect of bill of quantities, lack of specified and appropriate competent construction manager and impediment in prompt decision making. Similarly, causes of variation orders impacting project cost are additional work, client financial problems/ delay in payment of bill and change in design. Causes of variation orders impacting project time are change in design, delay in payment and dispute between parties to the contract. The control measures for the variation orders are appointment of project manager to supervise design, preparation of bill of quantities with good estimate and adequate financial planning. The findings of this study will be beneficial for developers, designers and contractors in building projects and also to the Governmental authorities to develop preventing measures to eliminate or reduce variation orders.",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Lockdown is considered to be an effective measure in slowing the spread of coronavirus. The study expects to understand community and healthcare providers’ perspectives on COVID-19 and pandemic responses during and after the lockdown in Nepal. Methods and material: Data were collected through telephone interviews with six representatives of community-based organizations and nine healthcare providers, and the collation of information about COVID-19 from social media, news outlets and government announcements. Data were thematically coded and analyzed according to the themes. Results: Although rapid dissemination of educational information through various social media was found, people reported an information overload on COVID-19 while questioning the authenticity of their sources. Several misbeliefs on the COVID-19 virus are rooted in the Nepalese community. Lockdown for a longer period was deemed an unsustainable preventive measure that directly impacted the income source of daily-wage workers. The fear of contracting coronavirus among healthcare providers at their workplaces was further triggered by the poor working conditions and non-availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). In fighting the pandemic, screening and management of other health issues were ignored. Conclusion: The prevention measures against COVID-19 are important for the local context, however, the communities need access of basic commodities and access to reliable information to enable them to follow these measures. Availability of appropriate PPE for the healthcare providers is required to reduce the fear of contracting the virus from the patients and workplace. Essential health-care services must also be continued to help reduce excess mortality and morbidity.

They play a vital role in daily life purposes to big engineering constructions such as dams, reservoirs or hydropower projects. It is mandatory to understand the morphology and dynamics of the river before initiating any projects for easier planning and to prevent possible damage to structures. The Malekhu Khola area is one of the potential areas for urbanization and has already been undergoing development of settlement and other infrastructures. This paper describes the morphology and dynamics of the Malekhu Khola to classify and characterize the river's behavior and competency. The Malekhu Khola is a sixth-order river having its total length of 24.83 km, watershed area of 101.28 km2 and the average gradient of 0.041 m/m. Various morphological parameters were measured with the aid of topographic maps, aerial photographs and Geographic Information System (GIS). The hydraulic parameters, channel sediment and slopes were measured at 10 different transects sites through field surveys. The river was classified using the Rosgen's Level II criteria. The river reaches have been classified as A4-, B4- and C4-type streams. A4- and B4-type streams are moderate-gradient gravelly and low sinuosity rivers whereas C4-type streams are low-gradient gravelly meandering river. The Malekhu Khola gradually changes from A4- to B4-type streams up to 12 km downstream, and then to C4-type stream further downstream, but B4-type streams reappear within the distance of 15 km to 19 km from the origin.

Recent growth in Nepal's banking sector, driven by factors such as increased financial inclusion and technological advancements, underscores the need for a highly motivated and productive workforce. Employee performance, defined as the measurable contribution of an individual to organizational goals, is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. This study explores the relationship between motivation and performance, drawing on need-based theories, goal-setting theory, and social cognitive theory, while considering Nepal's unique socio-cultural context. This study investigates the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors on employee performance within the banking sector in Nepal. Data were collected from 350 respondents across various banks through online surveys, with a pilot test conducted to ensure clarity and reliability. The survey assessed both types of motivational factors and their influence on employee performance. Demographic analysis provided key insights into the participant pool, enhancing the understanding of the sample's characteristics. The findings underscore the importance of both intrinsic factors, such as job satisfaction and professional development, and extrinsic factors, including competitive salaries and job security, as key motivators for employee performance. Additionally, the study highlights the influence of cultural values, such as collectivism and respect for hierarchy, in shaping employee motivation in Nepal. By employing a descriptive research design and rigorous methodological steps, including statistical analysis using SPSS, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the motivational landscape in Nepal's banking sector. The insights gained can guide banks in developing effective strategies to enhance employee motivation and performance, contributing to the overall success and growth of the industry.",https://nepjol.info/index.php/tjec/article/download/70243/53671,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

They are amongst the most frequent cause of hospitalization and surgery in gynecological practice. One cannot confidently distinguish a benign lesion from a malignant one on the basis of clinical, radiological or gross characteristics along so a histopathology examination is a must as it guides therapy. The study was undertaken to determine the morphologic spectrum of the cystic lesions of the ovary. Methods: This is a descriptive study which was carried out at Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital for a period of two years from 1st January 2011 to 31st  December 2012. A Total of 135 cases of ovarian cysts were received and processed in the Pathology Department. Hematoxylin and Eosin stained slides were examined. Results: Among the 135 ovarian cystic lesions, 119 cases (88.15%) were unilateral and 16 cases (11.85%) were bilateral. There were 59 cases (43.7%) of benign cysts, 69 cases (51.1%) of benign tumors, 5 cases (3.7%) of malignant tumors and 2 cases (1.5%) of borderline epithelial tumors. The age of patients ranged from 13 years to 73 years with mean age of presentation of 43 years. Among the ovarian cystic lesions the incidence of mature cystic teratoma was the highest (30%). The most common non-neoplastic cyst was endometriotic cyst (39%), while the most common benign tumor was mature cystic teratoma (58%). The malignant tumor encountered in the study was serous cystadenocarcinoma. Two cases of borderline epithelial tumors (1.5%) were also observed in the study. Conclusion: The most common cystic lesion that were encountered in the study was benign tumor followed by benign cyst. Of the benign tumors, mature cystic teratoma was the most frequently observed lesion. Among the non-neoplastic cysts, endometriotic cyst was the most frequently observed lesion.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/658/616,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Attitude can be formed from a person’s past and present. This profession continues to grow and the attitude of the society toward it has been changing gradually. There have been a few studies on the attitude of the nurses toward their own profession in Nepal. The primary objective of this study is to compare the attitude of the nursing students and the practicing nurses toward nursing profession. Methods: A quantitative, prospective comparative cross sectional study design was adapted for this study. Nursing students studying proficiency certificate level (PCL)in a Nursing campus, and the practicing nurses working at a Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) in Kathmandu, Nepal were selected as study population. Attitude scale for nursing profession (ASNP) developed by Ipek- Coban and Kasikci in 2011 was adapted for the purpose of this study. Results: A total of 240 participants were selected for the study. One hundred and twenty were nursing students and 120 were practicing nurses. Only 0.8% of nursing students had negative attitude and all practicing nurses had positive attitude toward nursing profession. The t test {t(238)=-2.868, p=0.005} value of the comparative study denoted the attitude of the students and practicing nurses was different statistically. Conclusion: Contrary to previous beliefs, there is a strong positive attitude on nursing profession among both nursing students and practicing nurses, the attitude of the later reaching 100%. This should be considered by health care planner in formulating national policy to take a major step toward creating more scope for trained nurses which will in turn reduce brain drain.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/864/773,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

All patients diagnosed with PRAKI were included in the study. Patient profiles in terms of age, parity, gestational age were studied along with time of occurrence of PRAKI, preceding event, etiology, management and maternal outcome. Descriptive and univariate analyses were conducted and qualitative variables were expressed as percentages while quantitative variables as means. Results: There were fifteen cases of PRAKI during the study period with incidence of 2.1 per 1000 deliveries. The average age was 25.23± 3.8 years and 9(60%) were primipara. Fourteen (93.3%) developed PRAKI in the postpartum period with 10(66.6%) cases following Lower Segment Caesarian Section (LSCS). The commonest etiology of PRAKI was severe preeclampsia/ Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet (HELLP) syndrome and pregnancy hemorrhages each consisting 4(26.6%) cases. The stage of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) according to RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, ESRD-End Stage Renal Disease) criteria was as follows: risk in 1(6.6%), injury in 3(20%) and failure in 11(73.3%) cases. Hemodialysis was necessary in 12(80%) cases while 3 cases (20%) improved with medical management only. The average duration of hospital stay was 25.2±14.7 days and 7(46.6%) needed ICU admission. Twelve (80%) cases recovered completely while two patients were dialysis dependent at the time of evaluation. There was one death. Conclusions: PRAKI occurred mainly in the postpartum period with severe preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome and hemorrhages as the most common causes. It is associated with high maternal morbidity, prolonged hospital stay and even mortality.

The household survey was carried out in Kailash (hill) and Nayabasti (terai) of Chitwan. Descriptive analysis, mean comparison, correlations, and biodiversity indices were used for data analysis. On the basis of biodiversity index, evenness, the adequate number of species, and Sorenson’s coefficient, open-pollinated (OP) (nonhybrid) vegetables were more diverse in hills than in terai, while hybrid vegetables are more diverse in terai than in hills. Hybrid vegetables were mostly grown in terai, where the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides was also higher. OP vegetables dominated hilly areas. Gurung ethnic community had a significant role in the conservation of indigenous vegetable biodiversity. The primary source of seed was home storage in the case of OP vegetables in hills. However, in terai, agro-concerns were used as a significant source of seeds, followed by co-operatives. Co-operatives’ involvement was high in terai as compared to hills, but the role was not significant in vegetable farming. In contrast, assistance in vegetable farming from agriculture service provider organizations was higher in hills as compared to terai. The major problem in vegetable farming was lack of irrigation in both areas, followed by market inaccessibility in hills, whereas climate change was rising as a problem in terai. Markets of produced goods were farm gate, local markets, and distant markets. A middleman mostly did the price determination of the products. Off-season vegetable farming was not practiced in the study areas. However, off-farm vegetable production was typical in hilly areas. Indigenous and OP vegetable biodiversity has been facing various challenges despite their roles in nutrition, indigenous knowledge promotion, and food security. Hence, it is suggested to strengthen government policy toward irrigation facility development, gene bank establishment, marketing facilities, and technology transfer and develop on-farm community based intense organizations for sustainable vegetable diversity conservation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/29731/23899,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The research site, with an area of 278.324 km2, consists of parts of the Kaski, Parbat, and Syangja Districts. A Statistical Index Method was used for hazard analysis that produced weights. Positive weight values for each factor class represented a higher hazard and vice versa. An inventory of the study area identified 556 landslides measuring 1.511 km2 indicating a landslide density of 2 per km2 area. Thirteen percent (36.18 km2) of the total experimental area was rated as a very high hazard zone.

Bringing the time series trade data from reliable sources, this study also attempts to highlight import dependency ratio, correlation of population and GDP per capita growth with total import and pin down plausible reasons behind these pictures. The correlation study between import data to population growth and GDP per capita showed a positive correlation with r values 0.71 (p<0.05) and 0.99 (p<0.05), respectively. National supply sides when combine with domestic production mimics aggregate rice demands and these figures show increasing patterns accompanied by growing imports together with import dependency ratio. India alone dominates the rice trade which accounts for more than 90 percent of Nepal’s import in recent years. These noticeable surges in rice imports can be attributed to liberal trade policies of the respective trade partner countries, improvement in incomes, closer proximity, similar languages, and consumer preferences among others. Opening a domestic market for rice cannot be denied theoretically in favor of welfare-improving policy tools, however, it should be carefully considered to protect local farmer’s concerns. Though growth in rice productivity is encouraging over the recent previous years, there is ample potential to increase further by integrated programs combining expansion of spring paddy, inputs, irrigation, and technology. Moreover, attention should be paid toward consumer’s fine rice preferences aligning farmer’s motivations. The introduction of fiscal policy with application of tariff or non-tariff measures at least for a few years can encourage the domestic rice industry. Above policy adjustment can drive Nepal toward its rice self-reliant footing.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44796/33691,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Nepal has contributed negligible amount of emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) of global greenhouse gas, it is the fourth most vulnerable country in the world. In this context, this paper aims to review climate change adaptation policies in terms of sectoral integration. This paper has adopted text-mining method for information retrieval and knowledge mining and followed step-by-step approach to undertake review of policies. It concludes that National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010 can be a milestone in sectoral adaptation of climate change issue largely because it has provided the national framework for sectoral adaptation to climate change. However, NAPA ignores the importance of structural and institutional reforms needed for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into sectoral agencies.

Institutional and Legislative Systems (ILS) approach has been adopted focusing on three aspects: i) legal and regulatory frameworks, ii) policies and programs, and iii) organizational/institutional set-up. This paper concludes that newly endorsed Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act (2017) can be a milestone in disaster management of Nepal not only because it has replaced about 40 years old Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 but also for the first time, it saw disaster risk management as an process focusing on different stages of disaster management cycles, preparedness, response and rehabilitation and mitigation. The provision of well-structured functional institutional set-up from the centre to local level can have positive outcome in disaster management. However, it overlooks significant aspect, such as the declaration of disaster-prone zones limiting the right of provincial disaster management committee only for recommendation to the Government of Nepal. Most of policies, strategies and legislations focused on some specific disasters such as flood, landslide, earthquake and GLOF/avalanches at national level paying less emphasis to the local level. Even now, most of the policy interventions towards different cycles of disaster risk management have laid emphasis on preparedness and response rather than to rehabilitation and mitigation. The conflicting provisions in Acts such as Water Resource Act (1992) and Building Act (1998) with Local Government Operation Act (2017) have made overlapping of their roles and responsibilities. So, the policy formulation and institutional set-up needs to be complemented by the ability and competence to operationalize the intent of the relevant acts and policies at all levels of government.The Geographical Journal of NepalVol. 11: 1-24, 2018 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/19546/16004,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

It has high demand of floriculture market in the Kathmandu Valley due to its physical characteristics and also its suitability to be used singly or in combination with other flowers in different floriculture products. So, the study has attempted to analyze the market of carnation cut flower in Kathmandu Valley. Data were collected from sample of carnation producers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers of the Kathmandu Valley. Simple random sampling technique was employed to select the respondents. Information from the respondents was generated through semi-structured interview schedule. Key informants were also interviewed for in-depth and related information. Data collected through personal interview and secondary sources was analyzed by applying descriptive statistical tools. Data analysis focused mainly on the market structure, conduct of marketing agents, and performance of carnation cut flower in the market in terms of returns to the marketing agents, present problems in marketing, and future prospects of carnation in Kathmandu Valley. Findings reveal that the market structure was well integrated and the conduct of the marketing actors was so far competitive to the large extent. The performance of the carnation cut flower in terms of price and profit seems satisfactory and sustainable. However, there were ample areas of improvements in the marketing system. Given the high degree of demand in the valley and increasing trend of imports of carnation cut flowers from other districts of the country as well as from foreign countries, concerted efforts must be made to reverse the situation and make the Valley self-reliant in fulfilling its demand alongside exporting to other districts and countries in the future.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/48025/35989,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Despite recognition of adaption in response to multiple changes in sustainable livelihood and critical climate change literature, risks attributed to biophysical effects of climate change have increasingly assumed importance. Consequently, diversification is promoted as an adaptive approach to reduce such risks. However, understanding livelihood adaptation from the vantage point of climate change alone might lead to a limited understanding of non-climatic factors also shaping it. This paper proposes understanding adaptation through analysing long-term livelihood changes and using society rather than climate change as a conceptual starting point. It argues that such an approach has better potential to highlight a broader range of dynamic drivers operating over decades and to inform contextually grounded rural livelihood adaptation policies. Changes are traced in the overall livelihood trajectories among four rural communities in Nepal, in living memory, to understand the role of adaptation in shaping it. Qualitative life narratives were collected and complemented by key informant interviews, field observations and the analysis of official documents. The findings suggest that livelihoods have shifted not only from subsistence towards income generation but also from engagement in diverse livelihood sectors towards specialisation; the opposite of the advocated diversification. The role of political, economic, social and cultural processes within and outside the community has been prominent in shaping this trajectory.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23416/19845,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Over the last 50 years, national parks, conservation areas, and hunting reserves have been set up in Indigenous territories relying upon the army and a model of militarization for security. As a result, the Indigenous communities that once stewarded those forests and ecosystems have been displaced from their lands and resources. Moreover, the relentless drive for economic growth has also dispossessed them similarly. In return, they receive few or no benefits from the projects, even as political and business elites cash in while their concerns for impacts on their natural and cultural environment are not even addressed. This chapter argues that their movements in the context of so-called development projects are not just challenging social and development injustice against them but also aimed at promoting environmental justice for the wider society and the country.

In eastern Nepal, several places have experienced ground fissures, sand boiling, and liquefaction during the large earthquakes in the past history. There are several factors including soil properties, groundwater level, grain size of sediments and ground acceleration that contribute to ground liquefaction. The eastern Nepal faced a devastating earthquake in 1934 (magnitude of 8.4), Udaypur earthquake in 1988 (magnitude of 6.6) and Sikkim-Nepal earthquake in 2011 (magnitude of 6.8) and there is still possibility of similar large earthquakes in future. Liquefaction was reported in many places during Nepal-Bihar earthquake that indicates possibility of liquefaction during similar earthquakes. Liquefaction potential values are calculated from sediment grain size, subsurface geology, groundwater level and standard penetration test (SPT)-N values. The epicenter, magnitude, and other parameters of Nepal-Bihar earthquake have been used to calculate the liquefaction potential.

The catchment lies in the Siwalik Hills composing the Siwalik Group of rocks of Middle Miocene to Early Pleistocene age. Owing to the week and fragile geology, the Siwalik Hills are prone to the gully erosion, shallow landslide and debris flow, during the heavy rain storms in monsoon seasons. In the present study, landslide susceptibility assessment was carried out using two methods, rapid field-based assessment and statistical index methods. For the susceptibility mapping of the river bank slopes, field- based method was used. The seven parameters such as slope angle, slope material, reduction to groundwater, effect of drainage, effect of past failure, effect of vegetation cover and effect of land use were used to calculate the factor of safety in the field. The slope areas were classified as highly susceptible (FS<0.7), susceptible (0.7<FS<1), marginally stable (1<FS<1.2) and stable (FS>1.2) categories, and finally, a susceptibility map was prepared. For the total 4.179 sq. km area where rapid field-based assessment was carried out, the areas covered by highly susceptible, susceptible, marginally stable and stable zones are respectively, 21.56%, 22.11%, 17.37% and 38.95%. Among the highly susceptible and susceptible zones identified, 71% sites have experienced recent slope failures. Landslide susceptibility mapping of the whole catchment area was prepared using statistical index method, and considering seven causative parameters such as elevation, slope, slope aspect, curvature, river proximity, stream density and lithology, which were determined and prepared from DEM using Arc GIS. Eighty percent landslides were used as the training sample for the spatial analysis, whereas 20% landslides were used for the validation of the study. The landslide susceptibility map exhibits the areas covered by very high, high, moderate, low and very low susceptibility zones are 47.18%, 25.28%, 19.77%, 3.60% and 4.16%, respectively. Validity of the study was determined using Riemann Sums method. Success Rate Curve shows that 78.04 % of the areas lie under the curve.

The construction industry for Roads and Bridges in Nepal is in a transitional phase and the working procedures varies on the individual capacity of each contractor. So, a practical approach is necessary for developing a methodology for estimation of duration. At present the estimated contract duration lacks uniformity among the projects of similar size and nature. With time extension issue getting much attention in recent amendments of PPR, estimation of duration has yet in the shadows among the lawmakers. This research aims at developing an empirical formulae for determination of contract duration based on the historical data of roads and bridges completed within the last five years. A total of 83 bridges and 78 road projects were analyzed. Regression analysis was carried out for developing a mathematical relation between time and cost of the project. The data was made to fit in Browmillow’s time-cost model. Apart from the cost of the project, there are other factors that affect the duration of the project. To address these project specific requirements, modification were recommended to the time-cost model by introducing coefficients in the empirical relation. As per the obtained equation, contract duration is directly proportional to the cost. However, the rate of increase in contract duration decreases with increase in cost. The reason for this is due to the higher level of parallel activities and better use of technologies for the contracts with higher cost. This model can be useful for government agencies, contractors and consultants involved in construction and procurement of roads and bridges in Nepal. The empirical formula obtained as an outcome of this research is applicable for roads and bridge projects of Nepal with estimated amount greater than two crore.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/njce/article/download/43372/32856,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

This study investigates the implementation and development of PPPs in Nepal, analyzing specific projects and reviewing existing literature to identify both the benefits and challenges associated with these partnerships. The findings reveal that while PPPs have the potential to attract private investment, enhance efficiency, and promote economic growth, they face several obstacles. Key challenges include an underdeveloped legal and regulatory framework, limited government capacity, and issues related to accountability and transparency. The necessity for a clear regulatory framework is paramount, as it would provide the guidelines needed for effective collaboration between public entities and private investors. Moreover, enhancing institutional capacity and establishing robust accountability mechanisms are crucial for strengthening the PPP model in Nepal. By addressing these systemic challenges, Nepal can better leverage PPPs to improve its infrastructure, stimulate economic development, and enhance public service delivery.

Many hill villages are situated on or adjacent to unstable slopes and old landslides are reactivated from time to time. The rapidly increasing construction of infrastructure, such as roads, irrigation canals, and dams without due consideration of natural hazards is contributing to triggering of landslides and debris flows. Thus, this paper has explored the cause and characteristics of landslides occurrences and their mitigation practices in Nepal. Topographic, geologic and triggering factors, and human intervention causing landslides are characterised to suggest the suitable mitigation options that can be implemented in the mountain hill-slopes. Among the wide range of slope stabilisation measures which are available to practitioner engineer, the lowering of groundwater level in combination of controlling of surface infiltration (e.g. sealing of tension cracks) of water into landslide are the most cost effective options for mountainous terrain because the rise in pore water pressure is one of the basic cause of landslides during the rainy season. In addition, removing of unstable slope debris, surface drainage, and retaining walls are the useful landslide mitigation measures depending on site conditions, availability of budget, and specific requirements. Various support systems and elements can be crafted for creative solutions of the slope instability problems in Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/23138/19639,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Hepatitis B infection is a global public health problem; its prevalence is ubiquitous and heterogeneous.This article reviews the situation and an impact of hepatitis B infection in the indigenous people in Nepal through the lens of equity perspective.Methods: Literature search and collection of information from different sources.Results: Hepatitis B prevalence is low (0.9%) at the country level in Nepal but higher, up to 38%, among the indigenous population compared to the national prevalence. Those who live in the high endemic areas are at risk of getting the infection from both vertical and horizontal mode of transmission. The unvaccinated cohort of infant (0-11 months) between 2003 and 2016 has swollen, 2764362 in number or 29 % of the total cohort. The National Immunization Program (NIP) administered hepatitis B vaccination at 6 weeks of birth, considering the low prevalence at the national level. The NIP does not prevent perinatal transmission of the infection. The mother to child transmission of the infection often leads to chronic liver diseases and about 20–30% of adults who are chronically infected will develop cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. The indigenous populations are thus disproportionately affected by the infection.Conclusions: The policy update is required to implement the hepatitis B vaccination at birth or within 24 hours in high endemic setting along with a comprehensive package to reduce the disparity, prevent the transmission, risk of chronic infection and its sequelae to achieve the national goal and international commitment on the sustainable development goal by 2030.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJOG/article/download/21608/17763,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

In the context of rational investment decision making on the stock market, the investigation of cognitive biases and emotional biases is measured. After careful consideration, the ontological research philosophy that employs interpretivism research philosophy has been chosen. The researcher has been hired with a semi-structured interview with three investors in the banking business with reference to the Nepal Bank Limited. The data analysis has been done qualitatively using theme analysis. This article presents the findings of the interview. All of the codes were arranged into categories, and themes were discovered. According to the findings of the study, the most common types of behavioural biases that investors in the banking business exhibit are cognitive biases and emotional biases. The evidence for this was obtained from Nepal Bank Limited. Both fundamental and technical analysis were utilised to determine how the outcomes of the study influenced the NBL stock market. In doing so, it brought to light arbitrage possibilities that arise from the psychological and behavioural flaws of investors. These biases include representativeness, availability biases, optimism, overconfidence, and herding behaviour. Because of these biases, individual investors in Nepal Bank Limited were impacted in both their opinions and their behaviour. When it comes to the emotional biases, investors are impacted by psychological and mental accounting, ambiguity aversion, and self[1]control when it comes to making investment decisions in the banking business, as evidenced by Nepal Bank Limited (NBL).

It is also a major cause of mortality in both developed and developing countries. This study was done to determine the bacterial profile causing neonatal sepsis and to assess their susceptibility pattern to various antimicrobial agents. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal among 340 neonates suspected of neonatal sepsis. Blood culture was performed and organisms were identified with Gram staining and conventional biochemical methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Results: The prevalence rate of neonatal sepsis was 20.3%. Among 340 neonates, 52.17% were males and 47.82% were females. Gram positive cocci were the most predominant isolates (88.40%). Among Gram positive cocci Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common isolates (72.46%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (7.24%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.34%) and Enterococcus fecalis (4.34%).

Thanju on my article ‘Water Resources of Nepal: Misconception and Reality’ published in The Rising Nepal on January 23 & 24, 2014.The rivers of Nepal possess sufficient hydropower potentiality to enhance the country’s socio-economic development. However, some spurious expert and vested interest group exaggerated the hydro potentiality and distorted the fact of water resources development prospective in Nepal. This has created confusion among the policymakers, politician and multilateral agencies. As a result, hydropower development in Nepal has headed for wrong course, and now the power sector, the vital impetus for socio-economic development is in dire strait. This paper highlights the uniqueness and distinct technical features of Nepalese Power Sector. In this paper important component like Integrated National Power System/Grid (INPS), Power Generation Modality (Hydropower, Thermal/Nuclear Plants and Diesel Plants) are well described and Master Plan, Project Selection, Construction Schedules and Hydropower potentiality of Nepal are discussed in detail. In a severe power and energy crisis situation in the country, power export is not recommended. Nepal needs 3000 MW to reach the level of other south Asian nations. INPS is owned and operated by NEA; therefore NEA also has the responsibility to prepare master plan for power generation, transmission and distribution. But, the Department Electricity Development a regulatory body of Ministry of Energy of is undertaking / carrying out feasibility study without taking care of INPS/country’s power requirement. This has created duplication of work and confusion; as such the Ministry of Energy deviated from its responsibility of preparing sound policy, regulation and monitoring them strictly. The Ministry shouldn’t indulge in feasibility study, construction and operational activities, which come under the responsibility of concerned technical department /authority.

We find large differences across ethnic groups, with the Madhesi group having distinct energy outcomes, for each of the four dimensions. However, progressively more detailed locational variables explain much of the difference. Our interactive analysis then suggests that some of the remaining variation is explained by socioeconomic variables of having a financial account, school attendance, or membership of a women’s group. However, ethnic inequality for the most place-based outcome, of living in an area with street lighting, is not reduced by education or women’s group membership. Our results therefore suggest that ethnic inequality in place-based energy outcomes may not be addressed by policies promoting education and community group participation. Policies to increase the proportions of households with access to financial accounts may have broader effectiveness in reducing ethnic energy inequality across many energy dimensions.",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Remittances are considered to be the most significant source of foreign currency that makes strong position of balance of payments, whereas the volume of imports is one of the most significant elements that lowers the volume of foreign currency reserve of the nation. It is generally believed that remittances have positive effects on volume of imports. On the contrary, if there is more imports than exports, it may run out trade deficit. It does make negative impact on the exchange rate of the home country. A weaker currency can raise the value of remittances sent back to the country, encouraging migrants to send more money home that influenced in growth of remittance.

Absentees and dropouts impose a large resource cost on the educational system and the society. The study examines the economic cost of absentee and dropout students in public schools of Nepal. Using data from public schools in a rural municipality in Nepal, the study estimates the unit cost of absentee and dropout students by level. Cost of human resource, stationery, utility and fixed costs of building and furniture were the components for estimating unit costs. The findings reveal that the unit cost of students was equivalent to U.S. $295, 130 and 143 for primary, lower-secondary, and secondary levels respectively, and an average of U.S. $189 overall. The resource loss due to dropout was around 28, 12, and 11 percent of the total resource spent for primary, lower secondary and secondary levels respectively with an average of around 16 percent. The combined resource loss from dropouts and absentees were found to be 39, 23 and 20 percent for the different levels. On average, 26 percent of the public-school resource was lost due to dropouts and absentees. The main causes of dropout and absenteeism were the lack of interest, motivation of parents and the children to attend the school. The study suggests the need for more comprehensive and in depth study for effective policy formulation to address this problem.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/36029/28135,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The results show that remittances have a strong positive association with trade deficits. Our findings indicate that remittances have contributed to trade deficits both in the long and short run. It suggests a symptomatic presence of ‘Dutch Disease’ leading to erosion in competitiveness and widening trade deficits. One way to reduce the ever widening trade deficit is to create conducive environment to channel the remittance on capital investment that supports the domestic production capacity.

Common natural disasters in Nepal impacting the livelihoods of the people below poverty are: earthquakes, floods and landslides. The return period of former is longer (+/- 70 years)but catastrophic, e.g. Gorkha-earthquake, while latter ones are recurrent and chaotic. Substantial efforts have been made on disaster risk reductions (DRR) both by the state and non-state organizations.

The pathways of change of POS are directly related to the urbanization process. Several factors play a vital role in creating an open space to satisfy peoples' physical and mental desires. This paper discusses the pathways and magnitude of change of POS and its drivers. This study is based on a detailed study of 32 sampled sites out of a total of 275 sites identified in Pokhara metropolitan city, and interviews with key informants in the concerned sites. The results show that there is no uniform trend in the change of open space. The area has remained constant in some sites whereas it has been decreased in some sites and also increased in some sites. Out of the total, 56.25 percent of patches remained constant in terms of area whereas 40.13 percent patches are decreased and increased in only 3.12 percent patches during the period between 1998 to 2018. There has been a net decrease of 24.652 hectors in the area in total. The increase of 3.12 percent attributed mainly to land pooling from individual ownership whereas the decrease is mainly due to the encroachment by individual people as well as for the construction of public infrastructure especially for expansion of the roads. The changes observed are not only limited to the change in the area but also the layout and the using pattern. Both the natural and the socio-economic factors including government policy are found responsible for such change. On the one hand, natural processes like sedimentation, landslides, floods, vegetation regeneration, cutting edge and on the other hand, government policies for the development of infrastructure facilities, rapid increase in urban area and consequent increase in land value, lack of awareness to the importance of open space among local people including local government are responsible for such change.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/28156/23204,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Pressure necrosis by the inflated balloon is the commonest culprit. Post-intubation tracheal stenosis is a major indication for tracheal resection and anastomosis. This study was done to find out the indications and results of surgery for post-intubation tracheal lesions. Methods: It was a descriptive observational study of patients with post- intubation tracheal lesions managed in Manmohan Cardiothoracic Vascular and Transplant Center over a period of 20 years (2001 to 2021). Results: Twenty-five patients were treated for post-intubation tracheal lesions. Four had isolated tracheo-esophageal fistula (TEF); eighteen had an isolated tracheal stenosis and three had both. Most had a tracheal resection and end-end anastomosis (REEA) via a cervical approach, resecting an average of 2.7 cm of tracheal length. The average size of stenotic lumen was 4.32 mm. There were no operative deaths. Two patients expired within a month of surgery: one due to fatal restenosis and the other due to sepsis. There were a few immediate and a few long-term complications. The average follow-up period was 5 years. Conclusion: Among the various post-intubation lesions, tracheal stenosis is the commonest indications for surgery.

The study is based on reviewing and analyzing the documents relating to the defined objectives and targets, investment policies, investment portfolio, legal framework for investment, and achievements. The study finds that all three social security institutions (SSIs) end up investing the accumulated funds in fixed deposits in the banking and financial institutions (BFIs.). This is despite the act empowering them to mobilize the accumulated funds in several productive sectors and set competitive investment goals. This indicates that they fail to explore productive avenues for sustainable investment of the accumulated funds, which could contribute to the economic development of the nation. The current challenges in the social security system in Nepal are the increasing number of pensioners and the need for sustainable investment; making it imperative for the Nepalese SSIs to evaluate their investment priority; feasibility and diversify for higher and long-term returns; focusing on areas that contribute to economic growth and development; and generating employment opportunities.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/68022/52144,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

This technique is based on a principle that bones or human body parts correlate positively with the stature. Stature can be estimated from measurements of various body parts such as arm, leg, feet, finger, facial height, nasal height etc. The aim of study was to correlate Stature of Nepalese with Nasal height and estimate Stature from Nasal height.Methods: A cross-sectional study of 214 healthy adults comprising 110 males and 104 females in the age group of 25 to 35 years were carried out. Study was carried out in central Nepal where people from various parts of Nepal are migrated. Total body height and Nasal height were recorded with stadiometer and sliding caliper respectively.Results: The mean of total body height in the male and female was 160.4 (±6.80) cm and 151.8 (±4.88) cm respectively. The mean of nasal height in the male and female was 4.6 (±0.31) cm and 4.3 (±0.29) cm respectively. This study observed that in both male and female nasal height had positive partial correlation with stature; r = 0.18 for male and 0.19 for female. Stature in nepali population could be calculated as: Stature=148.22+3.02x nasal height in male where as Stature=133.01+3.12x nasal height in female.Conclusions: Both Nepali male and female nasal height had positive partial correlation with stature; r = 0.18 for male and 0.19 for female.

Nepal has also faced heavy agricultural land abandonment from the mountain regions in the last two decades. This study is concerned with agricultural land abandonment and its impact on soil erosion in the Madi Watershed, Gandaki Province of Nepal. This study used high-resolution aerial photography and Google Earth images to map cultivated land and its abandonment in 1995 and 2020. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model has been used to estimate soil erosion. Studies revealed that more than 40% of the agricultural land was abandoned from 1995 to 2020 and there is higher spatial variability of abandonment intensity. High altitude and steeper slope areas have a higher intensity of abandonment than in lower altitude and lower slope gradients. There is a significant impact of abandonment of agricultural land on reducing soil erosion from 1995 to 2020. The average rate of soil erosion was quite high in 1995 but decreased to 51.5 percent in 2020. There are higher rates of reduction in soil erosion at higher altitudes and marginal lands like steeper slopes and the areas having lower solar radiation because of the higher proportion of agricultural land abandonment. Thus, it can be concluded that agricultural land abandonment during the last 25 years significantly impacts soil erosion control in the study area.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/63935/48383,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

In this study, staff of Nepalese commercial banks were given questionnaires as part of a descriptive research design in order to gather primary data. The sample size is 120 individuals from an actual sample. This finding suggests that workers have a strong understanding of external CSR activities taking place outside of the organization. It is also clear that employees are conscious of the effects of the CSR efforts and give them a favorable evaluation. The study also investigates the link between work happiness, organizational engagement, and overall views of CSR and employee perceptions of external CSR actions outside the firm. This finding suggests that workers in Nepal's banking industry may see external CSR efforts as positively affecting their loyalty to the firm and job happiness.

For this purpose, the paper combined the annual data from the WorldTravel and Tourism Council (WTTC) on direct and indirect contribution to employment and GDP with the total tourist arrival and the average length of stay data from Nepal Tourism Statistics to estimate a simple double log-linear equation-based individual elasticity coefficients. The findings of this paper suggest that besides government personal travel and tourism spending, other all elasticities are positive. Among them, the average length of stay has the most substantial and positive employment elasticity coefficient, which is relatively higher than the total number of arrival elasticity too.

The two countries share an open border that is nowhere found in a contested South Asia. Meanwhile, as a landlocked country between India and China, Nepal has struggled to keep up with its national interests and global aspirations. With its India centric foreign policy, Nepal has time and again attempted to reduce its dependence on India and sought to improve ties with China and other countries. The advent of globalisation in the 1990s bestowed Nepal to explore opportunities for its economic growth and shift to remuneration and services-based economy from agriculture. The labour migration from Nepal to third countries changed Nepal’s foreign policy objectives with India as until now India was the largest recipient of the Nepalese labourers. The arrival of democracy allowed Nepal to interact with China more openly in the last two decades, which has stood as a challenge to India’s traditional presence in Nepal. In this light, the present study examines the seventy years of India’s Nepal policy and attempts to contextualise China into it. It studies the overriding elements of Nepal’s foreign policy, along with India and China’s strategic interests in Nepal. With a focus on India’s Nepal policy, the paper further argues that India’s missteps and assertive stance towards Nepal have caused a great deal of damage, eventually pushing Nepal towards China. These moves have also presented Beijing an opportunity to advance its ties in trade, investment and military relations with Nepal and ensure stability and control in Tibet by putting a stop to anti-China activities in Nepal with the help and support from the Nepalese Government and Army.",https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/glocalism/article/download/20932/18563,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Using cross-sectional household level data from 282 farmers in four districts of Makwanpur, Palpa, Gulmi and Syangja, probit and treatment-effects models were used to identify factors that influence the adoption of RWH and its impact on farm income. The adoption of rain water harvesting was mostly driven by trainings that farmers received while controlling for age, poverty status and off-farm income. The adoption of RWH technology more than doubles household agricultural and livestock income. Instrumental variable approach was used to check the robustness of the findings. Adopters benefited from an increased supply of irrigation water, which allows them to diversify their crops from cereal production to high-value crops during dry season. Given the many weather-related uncertainties faced by rainfed farmers in Nepal, rain water harvesting is potentially a very useful climate adaptation strategy.

Some go readily for treatment, others only when in great pain and in advance state of ill health. This is especially true for people with advance age who have to face many physiological changes which act as a barrier to seek immediate help in health care setting. Thus, a study was conducted to analyse the health seeking behaviour among elderly. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 104 elderly aged 60 years and above. Non- probability convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data. Data was collected by interviewing the elderly at their residence. The data gathered was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics in SPSS software. Results: Assessment of the health status of elderly people revealed that, majority of the participant’s 86.5% were suffering from chronic health problem, among them 37.8% suffered from hypertension 11.1% suffered from diabetic mellitus. Whereas, assessment of the practice of health seeking behaviour among elderly stated that all the participant’s 100%  were seeking help for health problem in which 83.7% seek help from modern medication and still 16.3% seek help from alternative medication.  Also, the health seeking behavior was found to be statistically significant with health problem (p=0.002), ethnicity (0.007) and religion (p=0.007) respectively.

A total number of five species of mushroom were collected including two wild (Morchella sp. and Ganoderma sp.) and three cultivated species (Pleurotus sp., Agaricus sp. and Lentinula sp). The moisture, protein, crude fat, total ash, dietary fibre and carbohydrates were determined as nutrients whereas phenolic content, flavonoid content, antioxidant and mineral matter were determined as nutraceuticals. In this study, the highest amount of nutrients contained was protein (34%), fat (7%), fibres (42%), ash (11%), and carbohydrate (60%). The nutraceutical in these mushrooms is phenolic (0.79 μg of GAE/gm), flavonoid (0.585 μg of QE/gm) and antioxidant (0.261±0.036 mg/ml). The concentration of iron (26.19 mg/l) was found highest in all mushrooms, whereas lead and chromium were found in negligible amounts i.e., >1. The comparative study revealed that the nutrients in cultivated mushrooms have highest than in wild mushrooms. Moreover, the nutraceutical is maximum in wild mushrooms (phenolic content of 0.79 μg of GAE/gm, flavonoid content of 0.58 μg of GAE/gm) than in cultivated mushrooms. Furthermore, wild edible mushrooms are a good source of antioxidants than cultivated ones.

Delayed presentations are due to lack of awareness, reluctancy and poor accessibility to health care services often leads to local complications like sloughing of fungating breast lesions, secondary infection and bleeding. The aim of this study was to analyze the advanced breast cancer (ABC) patients who underwent palliative toilet mastectomy. Methods: Retrospective review of all patients presenting with ABC who underwent palliative toilet mastectomy in the breast unit of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital Kathmandu, Nepal from January 2016 to December 2018, was done. The data included were demographic profile, histopathological and immunohistochemistry report, indication of surgery, adjuvant therapy, timing of surgery, and quality of life after surgery. Results: Total number of breast carcinoma patients was 155 within the duration of 3 years. There were 7 (4.5%) cases of breast cancer treated with palliative toilet mastectomy with mean age of 57.9±12.7 years. The mean tumor size was 4.3±1.3cm.

Its therapeutic benefits are restricted by several adverse drug reactions (ADR). Therefore, it is necessary to measure its serum concentration for optimal dosing and clinical response and to minimize toxicity. The objectives of the study were to correlate dose of Lithium with its serum concentration and serum concentration of lithium with clinical effect. Material And Method: A cross sectional study was conducted in 213 patients presenting to psychiatric OPD, diagnosed with BPAD and taking Lithium monotherapy at least for 3 months. Data collection was done from 15th December 2018 to14th December 2019. Sociodemographic profile and relevant laboratory investigations were recorded on a self-designed proforma. Young Mania Rating Scale and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were applied for objective assessment of remission. Chi square test was used to correlate categorical data and ANOVA test was used for continuous data using SPSS at P-value of 0.05. Results: Majority of patients were male (51.6%), married (62.4%), Hindu (86.9%) and in remission phase (92%). Dose of lithium was 300-1200 mg/day; serum concentration was 0.26 to 1.51mmol/L, was in therapeutic range in majority of the patients (82.6%) and was positively correlated with the dose of lithium (P-value <0.0001). Conclusion: Lithium is very effective for maintenance therapy in BPAD with wide variation in dose and serum concentration. The dose of lithium should be guided both on the basis of clinical assessment and serum concentration.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JPAN/article/download/36281/28317,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

This study was conducted between November 2009 to April 2010. Specimen for the study was expectorated sputum. Gram-stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stains and culture were performed.RESULTS On direct microscopic examination, 20.51% were Gram positive bacteria, 79.48% were Gram negative bacteria and 4% were smear positive AFB. On culture sensitivity examination, 22% percent showed growth of different bacteria in different culture media. The bacteria isolated from the samples included Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.38%), Proteus mirabilis (15.38%) and Citrobacterfruendii (15.38%). Gram Negative bacteria were found most susceptible to Ciprofloxacin (92.30%, 24/26) and Amikacin (92.30%, 24/26). Similarly, Gram Positive bacteria were found most susceptible to Ciprofloxacin (100%, 8/8) followed by Cloxacillin and Cephalexin (87.5%, 7/8). Smear positive AFB was significantly associated with not using the protective measures (mask) by workers and presence of symptoms (cough for more than two weeks, night sweat, hemoptysis and anorexia) (p=0.031). Culture positivity was significantly associated with symptoms like production of purulent sputum (p=0.045).CONCLUSION There was insignificant association between LRTI and risk factors present in working room of garment industries.

Understanding the genetic variability of MAP, strains are important in diagnosis, epidemiological investigation, and therefore the formation of strategies for prevention and control of the disease. Thus, this study was designed to grasp the molecular characterization of MAP isolates of Nepal, as pioneer research of this area. Total of 46 MAP isolates obtained from cattle population of three different locations of dairy pocket areas of Chitwan, Nepal were typed using IS1311 polymerase chain reaction-restriction endonuclease analysis (PCR-REA) to research the MAP genotype of Nepal. The extracted DNA samples (n=46) were analyzed for the presence of MAP specific sequences (IS900) using PCR and DNA samples were further subjected to genotype differentiation using IS1311 PCR-REA and IS1311 L2 PCR-REA methods. All the DNA samples were positive for the entire three MAP specific sequences based PCRs. This study revealed that ‘Bison type’ strain is the single most prevalent MAP genotype circulating within the domestic cattle population of Nepal. IS1311 PCR-REA showed that MAP DNA samples of Nepal origin belonged to ‘Bison type’, whereas, IS1311 L2 PCR-REA method showed similarity with ""Indian Bison type"" and different restriction profiles of ‘Bison type’ genotype as compared to non-Indian strains.

Further lab test was carried out by adding 2% and 4% OM by weight on 100g of each soil samples, replicating each for three. The samples were incubated at 32oC for 45 days and the soil chemical properties; N, P2O5, K2O, pH and soil organic matter were analyzed. It was revealed that with the application of 4% OM by weight in all soil samples collected, there was increased in chemical parameters analyzed, followed by 2% OM by weight. The total soil nitrogen content and soil organic matter content was found significant (P<0.05) with different treatment of OM. Significant change was seen in the phosphorus content in the soil from brick kiln premises with the application of 4% OM. Slight increase was seen in the potassium content with the application of different treatments in the soils. With the application of 2% and 4% OM, pH was found to be increased significantly in the soil from brick kiln premises.

Remittances to Nepal rose dramatically in response to the earthquake by 20.9 percent in 2015 versus 3.2 percent in 2014. There is also a correlation between the level of remittance and hardship. The paper uses inflation as an indicator of ‘Financial Hardship’ to analyse the role of altruistic motives as a determinant of inflow of remittances. When prices of goods and services increase in the home country, the workers send more money to support their families. The Engel-Granger cointegration test is used to assess the short-run and the long-run relationship between inflation and remittances.

The main objective of this paper is to develop a desktop-based application that will aid children with autism in learning new words and in recognizing the various objects with the help of pictures and audio in games. The front end of the application has three main sections. Two of them were based on voice and pictures; one is speech training and the other is speech game. The third section is a game that consists of a game character which makes movements as per the head and facial gestures such as left and right, and jump. The performance parameters like accuracy of the character movements and voice recognition were calculated and were obtained as 97.09% and 85% respectively. The application was tested among neurotypical as well as people with autism, with the age ranging from 4 to 22. The tests showed the positive attitude toward the application for the learning by both groups however in differing ranges. Their involvement was measured against different parameters like their learning time, scores in the game etc. Thus, it can be concluded that this kind of learning platform can help the children with autism to grow their skills in different fields.

In this study, the latest and relevant rules and laws have been summarized to highlight the historical development of brick kiln regulations in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. Nevertheless, Bangladesh has been chosen as a case to understand brick kiln owners’ compliance status with applicable regulations in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal.

Socioeconomic factors affecting the degree of compliance of the industry to legal tools have been evaluated using logistic regression. The study shows that every brick kiln violated at least one Section of the Act. Per unit brick production cost has significantly increased due to compliance. This study also reveals that kilns with environmental clearance certificates were more likely to adopt modern technology. However, the kiln’s age, penalty, and production cost had a negative relationship with the adoption of modern technology. Total income from brick kilns and possession of an environmental clearance certificate was positively linked to the choice of coal or gas as a fuel rather than wood.

Most of our cancer patients present to the hospital quite late. In our everyday practice, we encounter many progressive incurable cancer patients who need palliative care. The goal of the palliative care is to relieve the pertinent symptoms or to improve quality of life (QoL) for patients with advanced cancer. We reviewed the palliative care services to the cancer patients at our center. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the cancer patients who received palliative care alone or in adjunct to curative treatment in Binayatara Cancer Center since its establishment in December 2018 was done. Results: A total of 108 patients received palliative care of which most were at advanced stage of disease (Stage IV). The male to female ratio was 1:1.45. The most common complaints for their visit was pain (62%) followed by nause and vomiting (32%), constipation (28%), anorexia (22%), shortness of breath, abdominal distension, seizure. Most of the patients with pain needed morphine (65%) for pain management followed by tramadol (25%) and NSAIDs (10%). Few of them were also supplemented with TCAs and anticonvulsants. Abdominal distension due to ascites was managed by ascitic tapping, Albumin supplementation while shortness of breath due to pleural effusion was managed by pleural fluid tapping. In one patient with pleural effusion, chest tube was inserted. Three patients with seizure due to brain metastasis were managed with anticonvulsant. A patient of prostate cancer with bony metastasis was managed with surgical orchidectomy. Conclusion: While considering the appropriate and effective use of palliative care, a palliative care physician is often confronted with a full range of multidisciplinary treatment options, and technical considerations that could potentially relieve some symptoms of advanced cancer in our settings.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/1096/1012,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Detailed geological maps and geological cross-sections were prepared on the scale of 1:25,000 following the most adopted stratigraphy of central Nepal for both hard rocks and Quaternary deposits. Two mappable geological units like the Tistung Formation and the Chandragiri Limestone of the Phulchauki Group are found within the hard rock succession at the study area’s hill sections. Similarly, the Quaternary succession is mapped into the Lukundol Formation and the Chapagaon Terrace deposits of Kathmandu Valley sediments from older to younger succession respectively. There is a distinct erosional unconformity between the rocks of the Phulchauki Group and the Quaternary Valley sediments. A kinematic analysis of discontinuities developed in the rocks was carried out in the rock slopes found in the area. Both field and laboratory analyses of soil samples were carried out for the representative samples. The laboratory tests include moisture content, specific gravity, particle size distribution, soil consistency, compaction, and consolidation properties.

The aim of this study was to evaluate prevalence of concomitant fracture and luxation injury (combination dental injuries) in permanent teeth. Methods: A total of 455 traumatized anterior teeth from 175 patients (131 males and 44 females; age ranged from 14 to 70 years), coming for treatment of traumatic dental injuries over a five-year period from January 2016 to December 2020 were included in the study. Patient’s age and sex, type of injury, type and number of injured teeth were recorded from the clinical and radiographic examination records. Descriptive statistical methods were used for data analysis. Results: A total of 257 teeth (56.48%) had fracture injury only, while 150 teeth (32.96%) were found to have luxation injury only. The most common isolated fracture injury was enamel-dentin fracture (n=93; 22.85%) and the most common isolated luxation injury was subluxation (n=77; 18.91%). A low prevalence of combination injury was observed in 48 teeth (10.54%). Enamel-dentin fracture (52.08%) was the most common fracture injury type presenting with a concomitant luxation injury. Similarly, the most frequent luxation injury type presenting with a concomitant crown fracture injury was subluxation (56.25%). The most common combination injury was enamel-dentin fracture in combination with subluxation injury (n=15; 31.25%). Conclusions: The magnitude of combination injury was low in this study and was frequently observed in males of young age groups. The most common combination injury was enamel-dentin fracture in combination with subluxation injury.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/42219/35130,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

In recent years, the life sustaining springs are reported to be drying and degrading in quality. However, there is a lack of information and knowledge in various aspects of springs in Nepal. This has limited the scope for groundwater development and management in hills and mountains. The present study focuses on identifying, surveying and keeping records of spring sources in the Bansbari area of Melamchi Municipality, Sindhupalchowk, Nepal, and intends to understand the distribution of springs in the area. Assessment of spring water quality and classification of springs is other major component of this study. Out of forty-one springs observed in the area, 85% are perennial and others are seasonal in nature. It is found that majority of the springs are located in the middle altitude ranging from 1000 to 1350m above mean sea level and in moderate slope varying from 10° to 35°. In terms of land use, 37% are located in forest followed by 34%in bushes and 29% in agricultural land. In terms of stream density, 61% of springs are located in places with low stream density. In terms of type of deposit, 51% are located in colluviums, followed by 25% in rock and 24% in residual soil. The springs in the study area are classified as depression spring and fracture spring. They are mostly non-thermal with weakly mineralized water ranging from soft to hard. The general order of dominance of major cations in the sampled springs is Ca2+>Mg2+>Na+>K+ and major anions is HCO3-> Cl->SO42-. Springs of magnitude fifth and less are observed in the study area with significant decrease of discharge in the dry season.

About 56% of the households receive remittances, the country also has high rates of undernutrition as 36% of children under five years of age are stunted. Remittance are known to increase household income, potentially contributing to improvements in health and nutrition of children, but few studies have examined it in the Nepalese context. Methods: We used data of 2,498 children under 5 years of age from the Nepal Living Standard Survey 2010/11 to investigate associations between childhood stunting and household remittances. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of child stunting by remittances received by the families in the 12 months preceding the survey. Guided by a conceptual framework, the model was adjusted for variables representing child, maternal and household level characteristics. Results: Our investigation showed that the odds of a child being stunted decreased with increased levels of remittance received by households, 67% (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.67) lower for households receiving more than Nrs.60,000 remittance per year. However, there was no difference in the risk of stunting by gender of the household head and income categories.Conclusions: An increased household income could potentially reduce the burden of chronic undernutrition in poor families in Nepal, which in turn paves a path for the expansion of cash transfer programs. Further research is indicated to understand the threshold of remittance or cash transfer needed to estimate nutritional outcomes.Keywords: Income; nutrition; remittance; stunting",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

There is growing evidence that forage and fodder production activity can be a potential adaptation strategy, but adopted in a limited scale. The objective of this study was to identify the determinants of forage and fodder production activity by livestock farmers in the Terai region of Nepal. Primary data collected through household survey of 600 households, 100 from each district in Morang, Sarlahi, Bara, Chitwan, Rupandehi and Banke were analyzed using logistic regression technique. Results showed that western Terai dummy and family size were negatively affecting the adoption of forage and fodder production. Whereas access to credit, size of livestock holding and training were positively and significantly affecting the adoption of the forage and fodder production activity. The magnitude of effect of these significant variables are western Terai dummy (25.2%), family size (92.60%), access to credit dummy (74.21%), size of livestock holding (10.8%) and training dummy (188.80%). Findings of the study suggested that provided opportunity to dairy farmers for participation in training on livestock production management practices and increased access to credit for making investment in dairy enterprises. Rearing livestock at commercial scale also motivates dairy farmers to produce forage and fodder in their own farm land. It is also recommended to provide lease- in land system for dairy farmers with large size family to grow forage and fodder crops aside from promotional activities are needed in western Terai region of the country in particular.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44848/33714,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

A quantitative analysis was conducted using data collected from 100 respondents residing in the Kathmandu Valley. The respondents, primarily fashion consumers and social media users, completed a set of questionnaires utilizing a 5-point Likert Scale. The data was analyzed using ANOVA, regression analysis, and correlation analysis to identify the specific factors driving the expansion of the fashion sector in Nepal. The findings reveal that brand awareness, the use of social media platforms, and the influence of social influencers significantly contribute to the growth of the Nepalese fashion industry. In contrast, customer loyalty was found to have no significant effect on this growth. Understanding these contributing factors allows brands and retailers to better comprehend consumer behavior and formulate effective strategies to enhance their market presence in the fashion industry. The study suggests that fashion brands should focus on increasing brand awareness and leveraging social media platforms and influencers to engage consumers effectively.

It provides a wide range of services and is of particular interest from a land use land cover (LULC) change perspective as it is naturally fragile and prone to degradation. The study was conducted in Madhesh Province Siwalik to assess the LULC change over three time periods and to quantify the change in ecosystem services value (ESV) due to LULC change. Remote sensing, Google Earth Engine and Arc GIS were used to prepare the land cover map. In 2000, 2010 and 2020 total area covered by the forest was 68.46%, 65.58% and 71.17%, agriculture was 16.50%, 18.21% and 16.21% and waterbodies were 4.40%, 3.89% and 3.79% respectively. From 2000-2010 forest and waterbodies decreased by 3.87%, and 0.54% respectively whereas agriculture and other land increased by 1.7% and 2.71% respectively. Similarly, from 2010 to 2020, agriculture, water bodies, and other land decreased by 1.99%, 0.10%, and 4.48% whereas forests increased by 6.58% respectively. The overall accuracy of the map is 90%, 89% and 88% for the years 2000, 2010 and 2020. The ESV was estimated using the value transfer method, which was 28 million USD/year, 26.84 million USD/year, and 28.97 million USD/year in 2000, 2010 and 2020, which showed that the total ESV has decreased by 1.16 and increased by 2.12 million USD from 2000-2020. An elasticity indicator shows 1% of land conversion in Siwalik resulted in 0.47 % and 0.21 % changes in ESVs during the two periods, respectively. Overall findings of this study, suggest that ESV has increased in the Siwalik region of Madhesh province in the last two decades, primarily due to an increase in forest cover. This increase should be taken as an opportunity to leverage policy support and programmatic implementation to increase forest cover and reduce land conversion",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The present study attempts to assess the vulnerability of the community due to climate change for which Chiti area of Besisahar Municipality from Lamjung district of Nepal was selected as the study area. The climate change vulnerability was assessed using the Long Term Research Program (LTRP). The long term climate change vulnerability household surveys from 2014 baseline data to 2016, 2017 and 2019 data were analysed in this study. This study adapted IPCC (2001) methodology i.e. also used by C4 EcoSolutions on their baseline climate change vulnerability assessment. This is a bottom-up, integrative approach that considers both physical and social dimensions at a local level. Consequently, vulnerability is best understood as a function of three components: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Exposure to climate change vulnerability is calculated with sum of changes in temperature, changes in rainfall patterns, changes in rainfall intensity, drought episodes and flooding events. Sensitivity is calculated based on slope failures, soil fertility, changes in natural environment (i) soil cover; ii) levels of river sedimentation; iii) water salinity; iv) river ecosystems; v) forest size; and vi) the presence of invasive species), economic dependency level, irrigation facilities and livelihood sources. The major finding is that Chiti has been facing climate change since last decade and it is found severely vulnerable due to climate change. There is an urgent need of improvement on climate change adaptive capacity which could result of awareness, information on climate change and adaptation, surplus production and change in agricultural practices. The present study has used awareness score based on conceptual awareness, experiential awareness, and engagement of household to talk about climate change and adaptation. The Long Term Research Approach is appropriate to assess climate change vulnerability in community level. Climate change awareness is one of the major components to reduce vulnerability to climate change in the research area.

In the context of Nepal, different studies show that the TVET graduates are unemployed, employed but in low wage, employed but not fulfilling the industry need. This is because of lack of meeting the demand of the market need by TVET courses. If the linkage is done, it increases productivity and nations economy. But the most challenging part is meeting the industry goals and skills by academic courses of TVET. So, academic skills and industry skills needs to be matched by revisiting the curriculum and other strategies. Also the industrial human resource could be upgraded by providing occupational skills upgrading training.

It is estimated as pregnancy related maternal mortality ratio (PRMR) in Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). However, 2011 National Population and Household Census (NPHC) gave a very high estimate of this indicator and challenged the 1996 and 2006 NDHS estimates. This warrants the evaluation of these estimates using another reliable source and this study aims to fill that gap. Method: The 2003 Nepal World Health Survey (WHS) data files were used to get PRMR for 1995-2002. SPSS syntax was used to create sibling history to compute PRMR for the country. Standard error was computed to get 95% confidence interval (CI) and compare it with NDHS and NPHC estimates.  Result: Data quality of sibling history was found to be reliable for getting maternal mortality estimates as age and age at death data was good. Adjusted PRMR of 285 was obtained for 1996-2002 with 95% CI of 161-391. This CI overlapped for 2006 NDHS estimate but it did not overlap the 1996 NDHS and 2011 NPHC estimates.  Conclusion: PRMR from 2003 Nepal WHS were found to be consistent with 1996 and 2006 NDHS as per reported confidence intervals but it was not consistent with the 2011 NPHC estimate. As NPHC used indirect method due to poor data quality of observed deaths and live births, it cannot be considered as a reliable estimate of PRMR. Thus, it is recommended to use surveillance based methods to get valid and reliable estimate of PRMR and MMR for Nepal.

Using the time series data of 48 years of the study period from 1975 to 2022, Engle-Granger’s co-integration and error correction models are used to examine the fiscal effects on the trade deficit, and the ARDL model is used to examine the effects on current account deficit. The basic variables used in the analysis are government expenditure to GDP ratio, budget deficit to GDP ratio, trade deficit to GDP ratio, broad money supply to GDP ratio, trade openness, real exchange rate, and real per-capita Indian GDP. Data are taken from the Ministry of Finance, Nepal Rastra Bank, and World Development Indicators. The findings show that the government expenditure to GDP ratio and trade openness positively affect the trade deficit as domestic factors, while real per-capita Indian GDP positively affects the trade deficit as an external factor. Also, the budget deficit to GDP ratio has a positive effect, while the broad money supply to GDP ratio has a negative effect on the current account deficit as domestic factors. The real exchange rate is negatively and real Indian per-capita GDP are positively driving the Nepal’s current account deficit as external factors. This study identifies the real exchange rate with Indian rupees, Indian real per-capita GDP, and financial development as novel explanatory variables of current account deficit and therefore provides additional evidence on external deficit in the context of Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/68023/52145,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The wide and increasing availability of census and socio-economic data, tools like GIS with an ease to use and advances in methodology has allowed increasing and refined GIS mapping of census variables. However, it is less emphasized that the result of analysis and presentation is always dependent on the unit of analysis. Data aggregation, choice of data classification method and spatial scale all have effect on mapping result. When administrative boundaries are restructured, it necessitates the aggregation of census data of one administrative level to another. In this context, the current paper explores the scale and zoning effect (changing boundary, changing number of units and data aggregation) on mapping census data. It explores the effect of four data classification methods at two spatial scales. Secondary data sources like local administrative boundary of Bajhang district and economically active population in agriculture is selected as representative census variable for mapping. GIS tool is applied for data mapping and analysis. The study found the higher calculated correlation value (0.88) for the restructured spatial units. The distribution of number of spatial units varied significantly between four data classification methods while plotted against the old boundary but there was not much variation in case of newly restructured boundary. The study found that zoning particularly, from smaller to larger units has blurred the spatial pattern visualization leading to a loss of the preferential information. The study concludes that the restructuring of administrative boundaries into larger unit has simplified the detail for spatial representation and has introduced additional generalization. For policy level analysis, use of data available at one level of the spatial unit when aggregated to higher level should be analyzed carefully using different data classification methods and visualization tools because scaled spatial representation matters in planning and policy aspect. It is meaningful to analyze data at different spatial scale to visualize and identify spatial variation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23413/19842,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

For the sustainable management of land resource of an area, land use may act as one of the elements of conflicts which could be resolved through land use planning ensuring equitable access and right of land to the owners. The present paper attempts to assess the land use for land use planning and infrastructure development through land evaluation including risk factors. Sambhunath municipality located within Saptari district of Nepal has been used as the study area to test the issues raised. Both qualitative and quantitative methods are used for data generation and analysis. Land use changes have been analyzed for the period 1986 to 2017. Potential land use zones have been identified through land suitability analysis using MCE-AHP and in relation to the risk factors such as flood, soil erosion, landslide, and fire. The infrastructure development plan has been allocated based on land use suitability index maps and planning guidelines. Land use projection have been made through Cellular Automata technique, and land use plans have been developed based on projected land use and optimized through SWOT analysis. Implementation strategy is developed based on legal framework to implement land use plan at local level. The land use change patterns are characterized by the increase of agriculture and built-up area and the decrease in areas under forest cover and water body simultaneously. Altogether 27 different criteria are identified and applied in land use suitability evaluation. Risk prone area is found mostly surrounding to the foot of Chure hill and along Khando river. Almost 46% of the total areas have been planned for future agriculture land use followed by residential, commercial, industrial and public uses which are 201 ha, 26 ha, 3ha, and 345 ha respectively.

In Nepal, the popularity of coffee is increasing for its high economic value. However, its diversity and the status of its genetic mapping have not been studied in Nepal. In the present study, the genetic diversity of 28 coffee accessions was assessed by using twenty-four SSR markers with the aim of studying the variation of coffee in accord with the genetic markers from a molecular approach. With the use of DNA extraction and marker selection for its amplification using PCR tools, a total of 81 loci from SSR were identified. Of all SSR 63.22% showed for mean polymorphism. The mean polymorphic information content of SSR was 0.38, which showed low genetic diversity of SSR markers among Coffea genotypes.  On the basis of the SSR marker, the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrogram constructed showed a similar group of distribution among 28 accessions, which was further supported by a principle coordinate analysis scatter plot. The phylogenetic relationships among the accessions were assessed by SSR marker, which also showed low diversity in coffee genotypes. Our study demonstrated the use of SSR markers in diversity analysis as the data were informative and highly reproducible for evaluating relationships among coffee cultivars in Nepal. The use of more markers systems and a high genotype pool would have been beneficial in accessing more accurately.

Infant and young child feeding is very important in promoting healthy growth and development, particularly during the first two years of child’s life. The awareness of mothers regarding expressed breast milk has a direct impact on the life of infants and feeding practices. The study aimed to find out possible determinants of awareness regarding expressed breast milk among mothers. Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 255 mothers from January 2020 to May 2020 by using probability simple random sampling technique. A validated and pre-tested semi-structured interview schedule was used. The data was collected data and analysed. Results: Mean age of mothers was 26 years. 54.1% of the respondents had low awareness regarding expressed breast milk. After adjustment some of the variables such as age of respondents (AOR = 0.03, CI = 0.01 - 0.08, p < 0.001), religion (AOR = 0.36, CI = 0.14 - 0.99, p < 0.001) and educational status of respondents (AOR = 4.40, CI = 1.72 - 11.26, p < 0.001), were significantly associated with level of awareness regarding expressed breast milk.

Despite development in the level of health education expertise in human resources and institutional obstetric care in our country, the delay in early recognition of the problem, transportation to proper health facility and getting proper expert care are major hurdles to reduce complications. Therefore we decided to study feto-maternal outcomes in our setting.Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional hospital based study carried out in Nobel Medical College, Biratnagar, from 17th June 2014 to 16th June 2015. Details and data obtained from Medical Record Section were analysed. All patients with eclampsia were included and fetomaternal outcomes measured in terms of complications. Simple descriptive statistical method was applied for analysis.Results: Among 8,066 deliveries, 112 had eclampsia with incidence of 13.8/1000 deliveries. Majority (41%) were of <19 years of age. Above 90% were unbooked. Aoubt 63.4% were primiparas and 83% had antepartum eclampsia. Eclamptic fits were more common (41.6%) in 37-40 weeks period of gestation. Fits to delivery interval was more than six hours in 89.1% women and 69.3% women underwent caesarean delivery. About 18.9% women developed eclampsia related complications. Common causes of maternal deaths (5.36%) were pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, cerebrovascular accidents and HELLP syndrome. Perinatal death was nine percent.Conclusions: Although the obstetric care facilities are improving with time, the feto-maternal outcomes are still poor in our country. Therefore early recognition and proper management are vital to tackle this challenge. Keywords: eclampsia; fetomaternal outcomes; retrospective analysis. | PubMed",https://www.jnma.com.np/jnma/index.php/jnma/article/download/2812/2347,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Among them, the flood is one of the natural disasters and that occurred in the Narayani River basin. The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising. In order to effectively manage and prepare for potential flood hazards in the study area, an analysis of the flood risk assessment was conducted by taking into consideration three primary factors: the flood hazard map, flood exposure, and flood vulnerability. The layers of the population, crops, schools, hospitals, and road network were all exposed to flooding, and the factors that determined flood vulnerabilities were literacy, urban area, and agecomposition (less than 14 and more than 65). The higher flood risk area was found in Ward number 1, 3, 4,16,18,26 of Bharatpur metropolitan, Gaindakot municipality ward number 1 and 12, 15 of Madhyabindu Municipality.",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Therefore, an attempt has been made in this review article to highlight some of the alternative production systems suitable for Nepal. The findings of this review paper were about regenerative agriculture technology reduced the cost of production through minimum tillage, less use of agriculture inputs, less labor, consumption of less irrigation, maintaining soil moisture, water holding capacity and nutrient value through crop residue, crop rotation, soil cover, reduced soil erosion and run off top layer soil and increases the soil fertility through soil carbon sequestration that mitigates the climate change effects. The major constraints of regenerative agriculture are the lack of appropriate information and technologies in hand.

Earthquake is a natural event which occurs without early warning signs. Computer based earthquake scenarios are used worldwide to describe and estimate the damage from potential earthquakes. The current study is an attempt to explore potential risk with respect to physical infrastructure and assess modeled and actual physical damage and human loss caused by different earthquake scenario and actual 2015 earthquake event in Thecho of Kathmandu valley. The earthquake scenario is based on two nearest fault lines. Risk Assessment Tools for the Diagnosis of Urban Seismic Risk (RADIUS) method has been applied for estimation of potential building damage and casualties..The research has adopted integrated approach using secondary and primary data sources such as field observation, key informant survey and building survey through purposive random sampling.The study found that potential building damage estimated by RADIUS for Gorkha 2015 earthquake scenario and North-west (Khokana) are lower than the actual post-earthquake assessment whereas North earthquake scenario resulted higher loss. Actual damage caused by 2015 earthquake compared to modeled damage from RADIUS is found higher because additional damaged were made by successive aftershocks. Spatial distribution of potential building damage for earthquake scenarios and actual 2015 earthquake event is also variable. North-Nuwakot Earthquake Scenario resulted more hazardous than the North-Khokana scenario though the location of epicenter is relatively farther with high intensity. The study concluded that though earthquake occurrence and disaster is still less predictable risk assessment tools like RADIUS and mitigation measures based on such is important for reducing risk of earthquake disaster.The Geographical Journal of NepalVol. 11: 127-136, 2018",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/19553/16011,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The menstruation features scantily within the code, indicating that regulating the menstruation and pollution associated with it was a personal matter under the authority of the household patriarch.

Similarly, diversion weir, surface settling basin and headrace penstock pipe of running 5 MW Mialung Project were also severely damaged by slides and rock falls. On the other hand, only minor cracking of sprayed concrete at corners and protruded edges in underground structures were observed. In hydro projects, there is a practice of considering seismic load in design of structures but the effects of earthquake induced hazards were not foreseen. This devastating earthquake gave good lessons for design considerations of hydro projects in future.

Diabetes was diagnosed on the basis of treatment history and random blood sugar test results of greater than 200 mg/dl. Diabetic retinopathy screening was done by ophthalmologists. All relevant data were imported into the RAAB software package (RAAB V.6) for analysis.Results: Among 4615 study population, 2.8 % (n=129) had diabetes, and 35.7% (n=46) of the diabetics were newly identified cases. Of the known diabetics, 61.4% (n=51) never had an eye examination, and only 27.7% (n=23) of cases had their eye checked for DR in the last year. Fundus examination showed 13.2 % (n=17) of the diabetic patients to have some form of diabetic retinopathy and 6.2% (n=8) had diabetic maculopathy. Only 0.8% (n=1) of the cases were categorized as sight-threatening DR but a greater number of diabetes patients had severe visual impairment or blindness (3.9%) as compared to non-diabetic patients (1.8%).Conclusions: Prevalence of diabetes and DR were relatively lower in Far-western Nepal. However poor coverage of screening examinations have left many of these cases undetected in the communities. Effective community-based diabetes and DR screening and referral programs can help to detect and treat diabetes and DR early on to prevent vision loss and other diabetic complications.

There is no literature on the morphometry of odontoids in the Nepalese population. MethodsTwo hundred and ten consecutive patients whose CT-scan of the head or cervical spine  were done without any evidence of cervical injury or fracture were included in the study. Morphometric measurements were done using Horos software in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. ResultsThe mean age was 42.32 ± 16.16 (range 17-76) years including 104 males and 106 females. The mean screw length was 36.52 ± 3.14 mm and the screw insertion angle in relation to the inferior endplate of C2 vertebrae is 55.66 ± 4.74 degrees.

Most of the officials are responsible for managing program and people rather than leading. Staff inspiration, motivation and encouragement, being one of the most important aspects of leadership, has been ignored in job description. District level officials are specifically assigned to manage programs and staff. As the position increases, the extent of practicing leadership increases and management decreases.

This study explores the current state of the brick industry in Nepal, the technologies used for brick production, and the feasibility of cleaner technologies using desk reviews, field surveys, and consultations. A total of 1.30 mT CO2-e (million tons of CO2 equivalent) emission is estimated from 1236 brick kilns in 41 districts of Nepal. The majority of brick kilns use traditional technologies, which are highly inefficient and produce large amounts of emissions. Several cleaner technologies are identified as viable alternatives, including Zigzag Kilns, Vertical Shaft Brick Kilns (VSBK), and Hybrid Hoffman Kilns (HHKs). Based on the evaluation of technological, environmental, financial, resource, and legal feasibilities, the zigzag and HHKs are identified as the most promising options for reducing emissions and improving environmental sustainability in the brick industry in Nepal. We conclude that while there are technical and economic barriers to adopting cleaner technologies in the brick industry, there are also opportunities for government support and private sector investment to drive more sustainable brick production in Nepal. A combination of policy incentives, financial support, and technical assistance help to accelerate the adoption of cleaner technologies in the brick industry, leading to significant environmental and economic benefits for the country.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2667010024000945,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Daraz, a leader in e-commerce, currently relies on two- and four-wheeled gasoline-powered vehicles for last-mile deliveries, using a hub-based model spread across nine locations across the Kathmandu valley. In line with its commitment to environmental sustainability, Daraz aims to convert its entire fleet of gasoline-powered vehicles to electric alternatives, thereby contributing to the global effort to reduce the carbon emissions. Our research yields compelling findings that highlight the significant benefits of transitioning from internal combustion engines (ICEs) to electric vehicles in the context of e-commerce last-mile delivery. These results highlight the financial and ecological benefits of adopting electric mobility in the logistics sector. We recommend that organizations involved in last-mile delivery, especially in e-commerce, carefully consider the use of electric vehicles as a financially prudent and environmentally friendly option. This conversion promises significant fuel savings, significantly improved fuel efficiency and an extremely short payback period of less than 5 years. In addition to these findings, our research also examines the transformative potential of energy consumption and emissions reduction in last-mile logistics. The energy consumption by EV is found to be less than 50% than that of petrol option. We reveal a stark disparity between petrol and electric vehicles, with petrol two- and four-wheelers showing significant energy consumption and emissions, especially in the area of carbon dioxide (CO2).

It increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases even leading to premature death. Almost half of the adults with hypertension had elevated blood pressure during childhood. With globalisation and lifestyle changes, adolescents are exposed to various risk factors. However, diagnosis in this population is difficult due to absence of symptoms. Thus, regular blood pressure screening is essential in these groups. This study aimed to find out the prevalence of hypertension and its determinants among the school going adolescents of Kathmandu, Nepal. Methods: This was a descriptive cross sectional study which included five private secondary schools of Kathmandu, Nepal. The adolescent students studying in classes VIII, IX and X were the study subjects. Two stage cluster random sampling technique was used to select 356 participants. Data collection was done by doing anthropometric measurements, blood pressure measurement and through self administered questionnaire. Results: The study depicted that the prevalence of elevated blood pressure was 12.4%, stage 1 hypertension 32.3% and stage 2 hypertension 9.8%. Similarly, 13.8% were overweight and 1.4% were obese. Bivariate analysis depicted significant association of prevalence of hypertension with gender, religion and obesity (p < 0.05). The multivariate analysis shows that the significant predictors of elevated blood pressure and/or hypertension were gender and obesity. Males were six times more likely to have elevated blood pressure (AOR = 6.058, CI = 2.571 - 14.274) and 2.8 times more likely to be hypertensive (AOR = 2.838, CI = 1.688 - 4.773) compared to females. Similarly, compared to obese/ overweight students, thin and normally built ones have less likelihood of having elevated blood pressure and hypertension. Conclusions: Hypertension has been prevalent among adolescents, due to various behavioural risk factors. This is really challenging and of public health significance. Regular screening of adolescents is essential for early detection and management of hypertension.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNPS/article/download/25377/23550,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Fourteen thin sections were examined to understand the deformation and metamorphism in the region. Field observations such as fault breccias, fault gouge, lineation, and slickensides, along with petrographic evidence of inverted and dynamic metamorphism, cataclastic deformation, and ribbon quartz, suggest the presence of a thrust equivalent to the Mahabharat Thrust (MT), a significant tectonic feature in the study area. Microstructural indicators like undulose extinction, grain boundary migration, recrystallisation, and deformation lamellae in quartz further confirm this thrust's existence. Two distinct carbonate successions were identified: the southern unit correlates with the Lesser Himalayan sequence, while the northern, more metamorphosed carbonate unit is associated with the Bhimphedi Group, part of the Jajarkot Thrust Sheet. Stratigraphic continuity is disrupted in some sections, where quartzite and schist replace the basal carbonate strata, likely due to thrusting. The thrust's propagation has impacted both footwall and hanging wall rocks, evidenced by features such as rotated garnets with spiral inclusions.

Then, an equal number of participants were selected from a randomly selected ward of Pokhara i.e. ward no 17 who were living in their own homes using a convenience sampling technique. Structured standard tools like Anxiety Scale-10 (ADS-10) and Geriatric Depression Scale- short version (GDS-15) were used for data collection and the data were collected using the interview technique. Descriptive statistics (mean, frequency, percentage, and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (chi-square test and independent t-test) were used. Results: Among 80 respondents, 30.00% had severe anxiety symptoms, 16.25% had moderate anxiety symptoms, 62.50% of respondents had suggestive depression symptoms and 10.00% had no depression. Anxiety level was significantly associated with their status of living (p=0.045) and having comorbidity (p=0.027). Depression level was significantly associated with work status (p=0.036) and having co-morbidity (p=0.013). Conclusions: Nearly half of the respondents had anxiety symptoms whereas one-third had depression symptoms. Senior citizens living in old age homes reported more symptoms of anxiety and depression than those who were living in their own homes. It is necessary to address the psychological aspects of the elderly and manage them holistically.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/64387/50911,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The present study aims to find the relationship between gross motor function and nutritional status in these children by comparing the proportion of stunting, wasting and under-weight between the various levels of gross motor function. Methods: Our study was across- sectional study conducted on 82 cases of cerebral palsy between one to five years of age visiting Kanti Children’s Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from May 2017 to September 2018. Their level of gross motor function was ascertained by applying the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and anthropometry was done using standard methods. On the basis of their motor function, the children were divided into two categories: those with poorer motor function who had poor self-mobility even with assistance (GMFCS level 4 and 5) and those with better motor function who had self-mobility with various degrees of assistance (GMFCS level 1, 2 and 3). Wasting, stunting and under-weight were compared between the two categories and odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was estimated for malnutrition. Results: The children belonging to poorer motor function were more likely to be underweight (Odds ratio 3.41; CI 1.36-8.52; p-value 0.008) and stunted (Odds ratio 3.9; CI 1.47-10.53; p-value 0.048) than those with better motor function.

Various classes of carbapenemases had been reported in Nepal. Most frequent was the New Delhi Metallo beta lactamase with many variants where NDM-1 was most prevalent. Similarly, Oxacillinase and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase producers were also prevalent in Nepal. While other carbapenemases like VIM, IPM, and DIM also detected. The isolates producing carbapenemases were extremely drug-resistant as they also co-produced various other carbapenemases, beta-lactamases, 16S rRNA methylase. Most isolates were resistant to many members of carbapenem, cephalosporin, quinolone, penicillin, aminoglycoside group of antibiotics.

A standard analytical method was used to analyze the texture, soil pH, (Organic matter (OM), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P2O5), and Potassium (K2O) status of samples at the National Soil Science Research Centre, Khumaltar. The sand, silt and clay content were 45.67±2.08, 35.6±51.37 and 18.49±0.93 respectively and were indicated as loam and sandy loam in texture. The soil was moderately acidic (pH 5.11±0.5) in nature. Soil organic matter ranged from low to medium but the medium (3.37±1.72 %) was prevalent. Total nitrogen content (0.22±0.01 %) and available phosphorus (230.58 ±85.61 ppm), were found to be high. Furthermore, available potassium (97.4±70.04 ppm) content was medium in the soil. The purpose of this soil fertility assessment is to help researchers and farmers in Daman, Palung know the soil fertility status of their area and to guide sustainable soil fertility practices. This soil fertility assessment aims to help researchers and farmers in Daman, Palung understand soil fertility status and determine the best soil fertility practices for their area.       ",https://nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/70764/53951,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

It represents a group of heterogenous disease with diverse biologic, clinical and molecular characteristics requiring personalized treatment. Based on Immunohistochemical markers, breast cancer is classified into distinct molecular subtypes. The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of molecular subtypes of all breast cancer patients treated at University Hospital of Nepal in the period over 3 years. Methods: A retrospective observational study was carried out in Breast Unit of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu. Electronic medical records of all breast cancer patients treated between January 2017 to December 2019 were retrieved from the hospital database. Patient’s characteristic, histological features and molecular subtypes were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 156 surgically treated breast carcinoma patients were studied. The median age of study population was 55 years (range 28–82years). Among these, 69 (44%) were of ≤45 years and 87 (56%) were over 45 years. The mean tumor size was 29 mm (range 50-140 mm). The most common histology was invasive ductal carcinoma (93.5%). Luminal type A was positive in 68 (43%) patients while luminal type B was present in 12 (7.6%) patients. Triple negative subtype was observed in 50 (32%) patients while HER2 rich subtype was seen in 25(16%). Incidence of Triple negative subtype was highest in patients less than 45 years (42%). Luminal A subtype was correlated with low tumor grade and less positive lymph nodes metastasis. Conclusion: The most common molecular subtype of breast cancer in Nepal is Luminal A having favorable features. The incidence of triple negative breast cancer is higher in Nepal, having an aggressive and clinically distinct subtype and is important for personalized treatment plan.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/1095/1011,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Each formation is further divided into three members; the lower, middle and upper, based on the ratio of mudstone vs. sandstone beds as well as color and grain size of sandstone. The Jagati Formation is characterized by reddish-brown mudstones interbedded with very fine- to coarse-grained sandstones. Paleosols characterized with burrows, rhizoliths, desiccation cracks, concretions and nodules are present in higher proportion than thinly laminated or massive mudstone beds. The Kala Formation comprises thin- to thick-bedded, very fine- to very coarse-grained sandstones and pebbly sandstones interbedded with reddishbrown, greenish-grey to dark-grey mudstones. Sandstone beds exhibit ""salt and pepper"" appearance. In the lower part of the upper member sub-rounded to rounded pebbles are scattered along with trough and planar cross-laminations in sandstone beds, whereas the gravel size tends to be larger and few cobble size gravels also appear in the upper part. Thinly laminated or massive mudstones are common and paleosols are less frequent. The age of the boundary between the Jagati and Kala Formations (Lower-Middle Siwaliks) is around 11.05 Ma. The boundaries age between the middle and upper members of the Jagati Formation is around 12.7 Ma and between the lower and middle members of the Kala Formation is around 9.0 Ma.

This is the first issue of volume 25 of JSSN. I take this opportunity to thank all the stakeholders of the JSSN and especially the founder of the JSSN.   A journal is a tool for publishing research and it is important to ensure that the research can be used by the community. They are important tools to disseminate scientific knowledge, improve the quality of research, identify new trends and provide a platform for published authors to showcase their work. Realizing this and with limited resources and experience in publishing, back in 1998 Prof. K. D. Joshi and his team published the first issue of the Journal of Society of Surgeons of Nepal. Because of their initiation, dedication and hard work, today we are here with this 25th volume to you.   The journal is an essential part of the scientific community, and it is essential for the advancement of knowledge. It is an important step in getting published, but publishing a journal is challenging especially in developing countries. Developing countries face unique challenges as compared to developed ones. The challenges of publishing in developing countries include lack of funds and limited resources, low quality of submissions, lack of qualified reviewers and editors, lack of publishers' support, low standards of proofreading etc. Scientific journals have become expensive to produce and there is little or no financial support available for their production. The costs include printing, distribution costs, website hosting and maintenance costs. While the whole of the editorial team are volunteers and some even have to spend out of their pocket for the journal. That’s the reason why there are not enough qualified volunteers for the editorial job in the journal. Most of the burden of work is on one or two persons. The most significant challenge is to get the right kind of peer review as peer review is also a volunteer task. Many authors who send the articles to the journal want early publication. But they don't have time to review articles for the same journal.   We while publishing JSSN face similar challenges. We are thankful to those who spent and are spending time and money on this novel task. This includes all past chief editors, editors, peer reviewers and technical staff.   Despite the challenges, JSSN is moving on to maintain national and international standards. We developed our online platform for article submission, processing and publication in 2014. Now all the new issues after that and most of the previous issues are available online. We received two stars (out of three) in the journal publishing practices and standards (JPPS) framework (https://www.journalquality.info)  in 2020 AD and working on getting three stars. We were able to get indexed in a reputed and prominent Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ, doag.org) in 2021.   Meeting the international standards and getting an index on a different platform is difficult because of a lack of funds and dedicated manpower for the journal. It also requires specific stringent criteria which need subscriptions to service and payment per article or yearly basis which is a burden for publishing societies. Publishing societies should support the journal to go ahead and be of international standard with additional cost if required.   The scientific community needs access to quality peer-reviewed journals that are accessible to researchers from developing countries. To reach this goal, we must invest more resources into supporting the journals and ensuring that they are sustainable. Journal is the face of a professional society like ours and is also one of the most important activities of society.  We are thankful to the Society of Surgeons of Nepal for the support which we have received till now. We hope JSSN will get more support and encouragement in future for the improvement of the quality of the journal and meeting ever-increasing international criteria of journal standards. Once again, we would like to thank all our readers, authors, peer reviewers, present and past editors and technical team for their support.

Primary aim was to measure adherence to anti-hypertensive medication and factors associated with low adherence.Methods: Morisky Medication Adherence Scale was used for measuring medication adherence and a structured questionnaire for measuring background and illness related factors in a cross-sectional study among 216 hypertensive patients in a tertiary care hospital selected through sequential sampling. Data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics and results presented with proportion or odds ratio with 95% CI.Results: It was found that 72% of the patients had low adherence to anti-hypertensive medication, with sub-group differences notably higher among females (77%); among those with co-morbidity (80%); and among those getting medicines free of cost (76%). Post multivariate logistic regression, it was found that patients with co-morbidity had higher odds of having low adherence (Adjusted Odds Ratio – AOR: 2.50; 95%CI:1.28-4.89) than those without; and those who get medicine free of cost had higher odds of having low adherence (AOR: 3.01; 95%CI:1.32-6.86) than those who pay for medicine.Conclusions: A substantial proportion of hypertensive patients had low adherence to medication. Presence of co-morbidity, getting medicine free of cost, and not having regular follow up were the major factors associated with low adherence to anti-hypertensive medication. Targeted interventions in hospitals and health care centers in Nepal would improve medication adherence.

The term PBC is coined to describe the fluctuation in economic activities from the intervention of the political actors before the election expecting to be re-elected in the forthcoming election. The abuse of political power in manipulating fiscal and monetary policies by the ruling party prior to the election period has become normal in developing countries like Nepal. The incumbent tries to convince their voters by increasing the size of the populist public expenditure before or during the election period. Nepal can’t be exceptional in the case of public resource manipulation during the time of the election. Democracy was restored in Nepal after the people’s political movement of 1990 and after that six consequent general elections were completed. The study used the annual data set from 1990/91 to 2017/18 and employed the ordinary least square method in three different models to capture the relationship among the variables used in the study. Real GDP, government consumption expenditure, and fiscal deficit are used as dependent variables of each model whereas government capital expenditure, transfer payment and subsidy, and total tax revenue are taken as independent variables under the study along with introducing election as a dummy variable. The results showed a positive relationship between the variables, but not enough to confirm the opportunistic political business cycle.

It is argued that fishing tourism should be systematically regularized and practiced in close collaboration with traditional ethnic fisher communities. Considering the potentiality, we elucidate the result of value chain analysis, arguing that promotion and streamlining of fishing tourism along with the traditional fishers could generate immense livelihood opportunities for resilience along with fish conservation. The value chain analysis showed that livelihood of fishers communities are likely to be enhanced by involving in fishing based tourism support services with fewer fishing activities, which in turn could be supportive to fish conservation. The present modality of promoting and systematizing fishing tourism might have implication to address the issues of poverty alleviation and resilience to fish conservation in many developing countries having similar socio-economic and agro ecological setups in Nepal. HYDRO Nepal Journal of Water Energy and EnvironmentVolume- 18, 2016, JanuaryPage -55 to 60",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/14647/11872,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Using geologic mapping and structural analysis, we show that a suite of pre-extensional shortening structures is offset by normal-oblique faults bounding the Thakkhola Graben that we use to define a piercing line.

The magnitude of arc-parallel extension is quite low compared to extensional structures to the west in the Gurla Mandhata-Humla region.

Studies on CA under Nepal’s rainfed farming systems of Terai and hills of Nepal improved the soil quality, increased individual crop and system yields, reduced labor demand and was economically profitable. However, lack of adequate soil moisture during planting in initial seasons, inadequate tillage equipment and weed management options are the key constraints of rainfed farming to be transformed into CA in initial stages.

Similarly, more than three million women suffer from severe complications from unsafe abortion every year. In 2002, responding to the public voices and high attribution of unsafe abortion on maternal mortality, Nepal granted legal access to safe abortion introducing safe abortion act. Women can seek abortion up to 12 weeks of gestation for any indication. However, sex selective pregnancy termination is prohibited in Nepal. This study aimed to assess the results of various studies on abortion practices in Nepal.

Despite the considerable progress, unsafe abortion is still a major issue in Nepal as it has been estimated that it constitutes half of all abortions undertaken every year. Published literature further showed that still an unmet need of safe abortion services exists in Nepal. However, the overall awareness of legal abortion was found to be high among Nepalese women.

For this achieving the purpose, secondary data of 1975 to 2017 have been used, which are referenced from the Nepal Rastra Bank. The analysis methods has been used the Auto Regression Model and Granger-Causality Tests for achieved the results. The result of the study reveals that there is a significant relationship between the export and economic growth of Nepal. The result showed when export increases by 1 unit then GDP increases by 0.58 units in short run. It indicates that current GDP growth is also affected by past year’s export. Similarly, Granger causality test also shows that export trade caucused to economic growth (p=0.0071) and foreign loan also caucused to economic growth (p=0.0410). It shows that there is a unidirectional causality with economic growth in Nepal. Hence, this study suggests that the policy makers should focus on exportable products which have potential for larger scale productions within the country, and comparative advantage for export trade as well as economic growth in Nepal. Moreover, national economic policy should be focused on investment friendly environment and creating a trust for foreign loan in Nepal.",,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

As the urbanization is growing in the Kathmandu Valley the banks of the streams are being targeted for the housing and roads, therefore it is important to know the characteristic of the river behavior, nature of erosion and sediment production along its banks. This study accesses the stream bank erosion characteristics and sediment production by erosion along the Godavari Khola. It was conducted by surveying and accessing hydraulic parameters, Bank Erosion and Lateral Instability status, streambank recession rates and gross sediment erosion from the bank. The Godavari Khola has high bank erodibility and lateral instability as the hazard level of Bank Erosion and Lateral Instability (BELI) and width/depth ratio are quite high. Since the slope and the bankfull depth exceed the critical slope and critical depth values, respectively, the Godavari Khola is competent enough to mobilize its sediments. The apparent recession rate of the banks of the Godavari Khola is 0.66 m per year yielding 85 m3 volume of the displaced material which weighs 141 tonnes. The estimated bank erosion rate is in between 0.02 to 0.235 m/y and the gross erosion is estimated to be 320 tonnes per year. Similar to the other river of the Kathmandu Valley, the Godavari Khola is very disturbed by the anthropogenic activities. Riparian vegetation clearing and bad agricultural practice is one of the major causes for the high bank erosion and instability of the Godavari Khola. ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/22787/19354,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Previous studies have shown an important reserve of slate which needs detailed investigation. Petrography and mineralogy of representative Nepalese slates are similar to the rest of the world’s roofing slate. The test results showed values within the acceptance thresholds for roofing slates. This paper also compares the Nepalese slates with other varieties of roofing slates from Spain.

Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are must to reduce morbidity and mortality due to following diseases. Therefore authentic data on these issues are of great importance. The aim of this study was to address this gap and create awareness regarding essence of control of Diabetes and Hypertension among political cadres of Nepal as they play major role in policy making. Materials & Methods:A descriptive cross-sectional study in the political cadres of Nepal was conducted at Pragya Bhawan, Kathmandu on 4th March, 2012 where delegates attended their 3rd National assembly. Standard criteria were used to describe both Hypertension and Diabetes and their respective goals. Awareness and treatment were based on self-report.Results:A total of 291 subjects were included in the study. The prevalence of hypertension was 44.32% while that of Diabetes was 18.56%. The current blood pressure of the study population was 50% within normal range and 50% of them was above normal range, body mass index of 35% was normal and rest was above normal range. 15% of the study population was known diabetic while 33% was known hypertensive. More than 50% of known diabetics had poor control over blood sugar and 72% of the known hypertensive had poor blood pressure control.Conclusion:The scenario of hypertension and diabetes control among the political cadres is not up to the mark. Most of those already having the disease have poor control of blood pressure and blood sugar level. From this, the situation obviously seems more warning in general population and needs well-designed assessment. ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JCMSN/article/download/17694/14996,,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

This study evaluates the current training in neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences during the postgraduate psychiatry training and reflect on current practice. Material And Method: The participants were psychiatrists (qualified and psychiatry residents). An online questionnaire using Survey Monkey electronic Platform was emailed with a uniform resource locator (URL). Results: Sixty-four out of ninety-five participants responded with response rate of 65.3%. Two-third of the respondents were qualified psychiatrists. The duration of neurology rotation ranged from 1 to 3 months and it was reported to be mandatory. Two-thirds reported that there is no clinical neuropsychiatry training during psychiatry residency.

Road traffic injuries are a major global public health problem despite being avoidable and preventable. In many low- and middle-income countries, the victims of road traffic crashes do not receive care at the scene and may die before reaching hospital. In low- and middle-income countries where prehospital emergency medical services are not well established, bystanders have the potential to save lives by providing first aid. Nepal has rising rates of road traffic injuries and emergency medical services are early in development. There is limited evidence on the factors that influence people in Nepal to become trained in first aid and to use their first aid skills.


To understand the barriers and facilitators to learning first aid and to applying those skills to help road traffic crash victims in Nepal.


Qualitative study using semistructured interviews.


Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kaski and Makwanpur districts in Nepal.


We interviewed three groups of participants: (1) members of the public who had never been trained in first aid, (2) members of the public who had been trained in first aid and (3) first aid trainers.


Interviews explored reasons why people may be interested in being trained and factors that would inhibit being trained or applying their first aid skills. Interviews were transcribed, translated into English and analysed thematically.


Respect from the public, a desire to help those in need and confidence to apply skills were important factors in encouraging people to learn and apply first aid. Barriers included lack of time and financial implications of providing first aid. The fear of social and legal consequences if the patient had a poor outcome, a lack of confidence to apply skills and lack of trust shown to first aiders by some members of the community discouraged learning and using first aid skills.


Participants were mostly from urban and semiurban areas. People with more difficult access to health care may have held different views. People who were untrained in first aid and agreed to participate may hold different views to those who were not recruited, as they had interest in the topic.


Members of the public can be encouraged to learn and apply first aid skills to help road traffic crash victims, but there are multiple barriers to engagement in first aid. Providing legal protection from prosecution for first aiders, raising public awareness of the value of first aid, addressing financial constraints and provision of refresher training may address these barriers.


Research to address the barriers to the creation of a Good Samaritan law appears warranted. The perspectives of other groups often involved in the care and/or transport of road traffic crash victims, such as taxi drivers, would add to our understanding of factors affecting the application of first aid. The gendered stereotypes reported by female first aiders warrant further exploration.
