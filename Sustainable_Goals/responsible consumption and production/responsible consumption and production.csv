It is an important crop for Nepal's upland farmers because it is a climate-smart crop that withstands environmental adversities and can be cultivated in rain-fed marginal lands with minimum or low external inputs (Joshi et al. 2002; Adhikari 2012). It is a rich and inexpensive source of dietary fibre, iron, calcium, and zinc (NARC 2005; Dida and Devos 2006; Mal et al. 2010). The role of finger millet as a cheap source of valuable nutrients becomes more prominent in a country like Nepal, where 25 percent of the population makes less than US$1.25 per day and where the indicators of human development and food security – such as life expectancy (69 years), child mortality (50 children U5/1,000 live births), underweight child (38.6 percent), maternal mortality (170 women/ 100,000 live births), and adult literacy (60 percent) – are dismal at regional as well as global levels. However, farmers are progressively losing interest in finger millet cultivation because of its tedious and labour-intensive agronomic practices and post-harvest operations. Moreover, it is neglected in the national research and extension system and generally perceived as a low-status food crop in Nepal.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The existing cultivation practices of this research area are conventional tillage (CT). Zero tillage (ZT) has been found as an effective crop management practice to rejuvenate soil fertility and increase crop yield. This research was conducted at Masuriya, Kailali district, the outreach site of Regional Agriculture Research Station (RARS), Doti, Nepal during October 2017 to March 2018 with the objective of identifying suitable tillage practice for high wheat crop profitability. ZT and CT were used as two treatments in 11 farmers’ fields. Seed-cum-fertilizer drill machine was used in ZT, whereas CT as farmers’ practice and field data as well as farmers’ perceptions were collected for analysis. The results revealed that farmers saved 10% human labour, 41.67% machinery labour and 25% seed amount in ZT compared to CT method. The net return of wheat was NRs. 54, 255.5/ha in ZT and NRs. 39298/ha in CT method of wheat production. The benefit: cost ratio was found 2.38 in ZT compared to 1.83 in CT which is 23.64% more over CT method. Similarly, grain yield was found to be increased by 6.28% in ZT method. Farmers who had adopted ZT method of wheat cultivation were found interested for the continuation of this technology in future too. The ZT technology is an important alternative to save the scare resources and reduce the cost of production and enhance the net farm income with higher benefit: cost ratio.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

With the tragedy of different problems of fertilizer importation, distribution, and use, stakeholders have started thinking organic production as an alternative of conventional agriculture in Nepal. However, transforming from conventional to organic agriculture is questioned because of conflicting finding regarding the real profitability of organic production technique. Responding to the situation, a study was conducted to analyze comparative economics of organic and conventional production system using gross margin and cost-benefit analysis covering five selected crops (rice, tomato, potato, bitter gourd, and cauliflower). The study was carried out by random sampling of 250 producers where 200 were conventional and 50 organic farms from five rural/municipalities of Sindhupalchhok, Dhading, Gorkha, Chitwan, and Rupandehi districts.

Here, we report on evidence that interfacing two metal thin films can suppress spin transmission and absorption. We examine spin pumping in spin-source/spacer/spin-sink heterostructures, where the spacer consists of metallic Cu and Cr thin films. The Cu/Cr spacer largely suppresses spin pumping—i.e., neither transmitting nor absorbing a significant amount of spin current—even though Cu or Cr alone transmits a sizable spin current. The antiferromagnetism of Cr is not essential for the suppression of spin pumping, as we observe similar suppression with Cu/V spacers with V as a nonmagnetic analog of Cr. We speculate that diverse combinations of spin-transparent metals may form interfaces that suppress spin pumping, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our work may stimulate a new perspective on spin transport in metallic multilayers.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Among them, the flood is one of the natural disasters and that occurred in the Narayani River basin. The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising. In order to effectively manage and prepare for potential flood hazards in the study area, an analysis of the flood risk assessment was conducted by taking into consideration three primary factors: the flood hazard map, flood exposure, and flood vulnerability. The layers of the population, crops, schools, hospitals, and road network were all exposed to flooding, and the factors that determined flood vulnerabilities were literacy, urban area, and agecomposition (less than 14 and more than 65). The higher flood risk area was found in Ward number 1, 3, 4,16,18,26 of Bharatpur metropolitan, Gaindakot municipality ward number 1 and 12, 15 of Madhyabindu Municipality.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/978-1-349-95839-9_1439,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Nepal is strewn with highly expensive development failures that have lined the pockets of Western consultants and companies, as well as less-than-honest domestic decision makers (see Chapters 3, 4 and 10). These include the infamous Arun 3 dam and similarly large hydro projects, often pushed by the World Bank and other aid donors (Chapter 8).

In 1998, the Nepalese Ministry of Health (MOH) launched an Infectious Disease (ID) programme. The key components of the programme were to establish a surveillance programme for AMR and to develop awareness among physicians regarding AMR and rational drug usage in Nepal.MethodsAn AMR surveillance programme was established and implemented by the Nepalese MOH in partnership with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR, B) from 1998 to 2003. From 2004 to 2012, the programme was integrated and maintained as a core activity of the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) and resulted in an increased number of participating laboratories and pathogens brought under surveillance. The main strategies were to build national capacity on isolation, identification and AMR testing of bacterial pathogens, establish laboratory networking and an External Quality Assessment (EQA) programme, promote standardised recording and reporting of results, and to ensure timely analysis and dissemination of data for advocacy and national policy adaptations. The programme was initiated by nine participating laboratories performing AMR surveillance on Vibrio cholerae, Shigella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.ResultsThe number of participating laboratories was ultimately increased to 13 and the number of pathogens under surveillance was increased to seven (Salmonella spp. was added to the surveillance programme in 2002 and extended spectrum β-lactamase producing Escherichia coli in 2011). From 1999 to 2012, data were available on 17,103 bacterial isolates. During the AMR programme, we observed changing trends in serovars/ species for Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and V. cholerae and changing AMR trend for all organisms. Notably, N. gonorrhoeae isolates demonstrated increasing resistance to ciprofloxacin. Additionally, the performance of the participating laboratories improved as shown by annual EQA data evaluation.ConclusionsThis Nepalese AMR programme continues and serves as a model for sustainable surveillance of AMR monitoring in resource limited settings.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The ARIMA model was initially employed to forecast paddy production. The availability of agricultural land was subsequently included as an exogenous variable in the ARIMAX model (after a significant endogeneity test) to increase precision. In contrast to the ARIMA model, which predicted paddy production of 5787.64 metric tons per hectare for the year 2022, the ARIMAX model predicted 5681.17 metric tons per hectare. Compared to the ARIMA model's MAE (0.0295), MAPE (0.797), and RMSE (0.0373), the ARIMAX model exhibited better accuracy with lower values of MAE (0.0247), MAPE (0.667), and RMSE (0.0301). The results emphasize how crucial it is to include pertinent exogenous variables to capture important dynamics influencing agricultural output. The study has important ramifications for Nepalese policymakers and agricultural planners since it suggests that the ARIMAX model can provide additional insight for policies that maximize production and optimize land usage, hence promoting food security and economic stability.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/ern/article/download/67970/51908,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Nepal’s National Planning Commission (NPC) in 2016 had released a concept paper on smart cities for Nepal, defining smart cities as sustainable, information and technology-based, with high quality services and replicable (NPC 2016). As most Nepali cities still operate with limited infrastructure, services, and amenities, making them smart is a challenging task. However, some elements of a smart city can be incrementally and selectively implemented by the Nepali urban governments. This paper assesses the successes and challenges in some of the smart cities globally, and as an example assesses the pollution reduction and efficiency impact of adopting a bus-rapid transit system in Nepal. It is seen that a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system for the Kathmandu Valley consisting of electrical buses, will drastically reduce air pollution, and improve mobility for the residents. Urban leaders in Nepal can begin to identify such a transit related and other smart elements to be gradually implemented in their cities which will improve efficiency of urban services, enhance quality of life for the urban residents, and promote sustainability of the overall urban system.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/45769/35807,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

However, the broiler poultry value chain in Sindhuli District faces various challenges, including inefficiencies in production and marketing. This study aimed to analyze the value chain of broiler poultry production in Sindhuli District to identify key processes, challenges, and opportunities for improvement. The study was carried out during May-September 2023 through questionnaire format. Out of 55 respondents, 40 broiler poultry farms, 1 hatchery (broilers), 2 agro-vets and 10 retailers were surveyed where 5 core processes (input supply, production, collection, marketing, and consumption) were identified. Among the poultry farmers, 63% were male and 37% females. This study revealed a strong correlation between age and experience, emphasizing the pivotal role of experience in poultry farming. Educational backgrounds varied widely, with 27% respondents having only elementary education and only 3% respondents having attained a University-level education. Farm registration patterns followed distinct peaks in 2074, 2076, and 2077, reflecting the evolving landscape of poultry farming. Small-scale poultry operations, managing 500-1000 birds, dominated the sector. The intensive deep litter housing systems were found to be adopted by 100% of broiler framers at different scale and there was reliance on commercial feeds from sources outside the district. The respondents exhibited responsible antibiotic usage, with 90% farmers administering antibiotics therapeutically. A total of 70% farmers reported disease incidences on their farms, with Colibacillosis, Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD), Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD), Newcastle Disease (ND), and Mycotoxicosis being the most encountered issues. This study identified challenges such as limited disease preparedness and biosecurity measures, small-scale poultry farming, restricted financial resources and opportunities for enhanced training, improving marketing channels and greater adoption of biosecurity practices.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/nepjas/article/download/77628/59507,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Such screening programs and related data are lacking in less developed countries. We documented and analyzed the mammographic trends at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, a tertiary care referral center, in Kathmandu, Nepal, to develop baseline data which may be helpful in further researches.Methods: In this descriptive study, imaging findings of consecutive patients who had undergone mammography between July 2016 and March 2018 were reviewed after obtaining ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Committee. Ultrasonography and histopathological examination were done as needed. Demographics, presenting complaints, breast density, Breast Imaging, Reporting, Assessment and Data System category and final diagnosis were recorded and analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.Results: There were more diagnostic mammograms (62%) than screening with mastalgia the most common presenting complaint. Breast density was less in screening group. Overall, there were more benign lesions with incidence of breast cancer being 4.4% more in the diagnostic group. The age range varied from 22 to 86 years, with 15% (n=219) below 40 years age accounting for one-third of the cases of extremely dense breast and one-fourth of the suspicious lesions. Nearly 50% of breast cancers were seen in patients less than 50 years of age.Conclusions: The study showed greater number of diagnostic than screening mammograms, with malignancies detected more often in the diagnostic group and younger age.

However, there is a widespread view that young men and women are becoming more at ease in each other's company and beginning sexual experiences prior to marriage, putting them at risk of the consequences of unsafe sex. This research aims to evaluate the factors associated with premarital sexual behavior and its consequences among Nepalese college-going adolescents and youths. This cross-sectional web-based study included 415 Nepalese students over the age of 18 who were enrolled in a bachelor's degree program in a discipline other than health science. Data was collected from students online using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Pearson's chi-square (χ2) and logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between the independent and outcome variables. Most participants (61.7%) had dating experience and 21.2% had premarital sex. About three-fourths (76.1%) of participants had premarital sex before the age of 20 years and the ages of sexual debut ranged from 13 to 25 years. The major reasons for sexual debut were desire, curiosity, continuation of love relationship, and peer pressure. One-third of students (33.0%) reported having more than two sex partners, and 11.4% had intercourse with commercial sex workers. Among students who had premarital sex, 13.7% of participants or their sex partners, had to undergo abortions because of unintended pregnancies.

When it comes to the use of the inputs, the majority of respondents who were rice seed producers employed herbicide to control weeds, insecticide to control insects, a mechanical mode of harvesting, and burning the stubble in the field. The major production constraint was found to be the unavailability of quality inputs (I = 0.76), and the major marketing bottleneck was found to be the unavailability of processing units (I = 0.71). This research suggests that input requirements and some agronomic management practices differ between rice seed and grain growers. Further, the productivity and profitability of seed production are higher than grain production in rice.",https://ejmanager.com/mnstemps/112/112-1679147048.pdf,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Among various retainers used, Hawley retainer and ‘invisible’ retainers are the most common. Most of the orthodontists favored permanent retention. It is obvious that the retention procedures are variable and depended largely on personal preferences, and there does not seem to be any consistent pattern in the application of retention methodologies. The  purpose of this study was to survey the retention protocols among orthodontists in Nepal. Materials and Method: The complete lists of the names and addresses of orthodontists in Nepal was obtained from the ODOAN. The questionnaire was sent to them which consisted of multiple-choice questions and short answer, related to background information of the individual orthodontist, retention use in general, the frequency of different types of bonded or removable retainers that are used, the retention protocol, the type of retainer used in specific situation. All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 12.0.1 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA) Result: The survey questionnaires were completed by 90.42% of the 94 orthodontists of Nepal, 58.8% males and 41.2% females with a mean age of 36.7 years. Most of the orthodontists used a clear (vacuum) retainer (80%) in the maxilla and fixed bonded retainer in the mandible. Most of them prefer the use of retainer for a continuous 24 hours except during eating and brushing for 6 months to 1 year (56.5%) and if possible, for 1 to 2 years (28.2%). Conclusion: Majority of Nepalese orthodontists provide vacuum formed retainer on maxillary arch and bonded retainer in mandibular arch.

So, the main objectives of this study were to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns along with the rates of inducible clindamycin resistance, methicillin resistance and biofilm production among the strains of S. aureus isolated from pus/wound swab samples.A total of 830 non-repeated pus/wound swab samples were processed using standard microbiological techniques. The colonies grown were identified on the basis of colony morphology, Gram's stain and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique. Detection of inducible clindamycin resistance was performed by D test, while detection of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was performed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of oxacillin by agar dilution method. Similarly, detection of biofilm formation was performed by microtiter plate method. Strains showing resistance to three or more than three different classes of antibiotics were considered multidrug resistant.Total 76 samples showed the growth of S. aureus, among which 36 (47.4%) contained MRSA and 17 (22.4%) samples were found to have S. aureus showing inducible clindamycin resistance. Among the S. aureus isolated from outpatients, 41.9% were MRSA. Highest rates of susceptibility of S. aureus were seen toward linezolid (100%) and vancomycin (100%). Similarly, S. aureus isolated from 35 (46.1%) samples were found to be biofilm producers. Higher rate of inducible clindamycin resistance was seen among MRSA in comparison to methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Similarly, higher rates of multidrug resistance and methicillin resistance were found among biofilm producing strains in comparison to biofilm non producing strains.The rate of isolation of MRSA from community acquired infections was found to be high in Nepal. Increased rate of inducible clindamycin resistance as compared to previous studies in Nepal was noted. So for the proper management of the infections caused by S. aureus, D test for the detection of inducible clindamycin resistance should be included in the routine laboratory diagnosis. Further, detection of biofilm production should also be included in the routine tests.

The study emphasizes the economic value of mandarins, especially in the mid-hill’s region, as well as their health advantages because of their fiber and antioxidant content. The yield of mandarin has decreased as a result of several issues, such as high investment costs, lack of adoption of improved technology, poor orchard management, diseases and pests, unstable prices and profit margins along with inappropriate market channels. Therefore, in order to strengthen this subsector, it is advised to focus on developing mandarin productivity through conventional mechanization, better adoption of technology, price intervention, market recognition, HLB management, establishment of storage and processing centers, and diplomatic relations for easy international marketing.",https://newinera.com/index.php/JournalLaLifesci/article/download/1304/1402,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Most of the patients were diagnosed to have pulmonary bacteriologically confirmed (PBC) tuberculosis 52.4%, PCD (Pulmonary clinically diagnosed) 16.7%, Extra-pulmonary 28.6% with one case of each multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), and Pre-XDR (Extensive drug resistant) TB. Among them, 12% of people had a history of TB undergone ATT (anti-tuberculosis drugs) in the past with 6% having a close contact history.    Conclusions: Tuberculosis infection, disease, and mortality seem to be less common at high than low altitudes. As in Karnali Province, Humla with the second being Jumla has the lowest number of TB patients than other parts of Nepal, affecting younger people.    ",https://nmj.com.np/nmj/index.php/nmj/article/download/155/154,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Therefore, in this backdrop forecasting rice production, which is consistently becoming a prime determinant of food security in Nepal, is of paramount importance. The study forecasted the rice area and yield from 2018 to 2030 using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The production of rice was calculated by multiplying rice area and productivity. The data on rice production and yield were accessed from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) database known as FAOSTAT, from 1961 to 2017. The model suggested that rice area and yield will increase at an average rate of 0.47 and 0.73 percent respectively from 2018 to 2030.

The prevalence of skin changes and their association with neonatal and maternal factors are not adequately documented in Nepal. It is important to differentiate common benign skin lesions from infrequent skin changes that cause morbidity, requiring medical management. The objectives of this study were to determine the pattern of skin lesions in new-borns and their association with maternal and neonatal variables.Material and Methods: This was a prospective, cross-sectional study conducted in obstetric unit of the hospital from December 2016 to May 2017. Outborn babies and babies shifted to NICU were excluded.Results: A total of 935 new-borns were examined. The commonest skin lesions were Mongolian spot (66.7%), Erythema toxicum (46.6%), Milia (44.4%), Epstein pearls (26.4%) and Salmon patch (11.9%). Mothers aged 35 years or older (63.6%) had statistically significant association with Erythema toxicum (p=0.01). Erythema toxicum was more in primiparity, term pregnancy and caesarean section delivery. Milia was associated with male babies. Salmon patch was seen more in term pregnancy. Congenital melanocytic nevus, haemangioma and port-wine stain were noted in three, two and one new-borns respectively, which alter morbidity and hence are important to diagnose in time.Conclusion: We found that 93.8% of neonates had at one or more skin lesions. The majority of skin lesions were benign and transient. Erythema toxicum was seen commonly in mothers aged 35 and more.

The broad objective was to observe the return and profit margin per unit area of maize in the aforementioned areas. The specific objectives were finding profit margin, and benefit: cost ratio, finding out the problems of farmers and determining factors affecting maize yield. Data about total variable cost, profitability, return of maize farming, and factors affecting maize production were collected. Overall, the research revealed that the average cost of maize cultivation per hectare was NRs 40213.85 and the average return per hectare was NRs 72676.04 with average profit per hectare was found NRs. 32462.19. The average benefit-cost ratio was 1.80. The maize farm was distinguished into three categories as Small-sized farms (<10 Katha), Medium-sized farms (10-40 Katha) and Large-sized farms (>40 Katha). The cost of cultivation was found higher in the case of Small-sized farms. Mechanization cost covers 30.32% of the total cost of production. An increase in the age of the farmer by 1 year increases the yield by 2% this is seen at 1% level of significance.

Economic hardships mean that in such countries, many children and young people are exploited in the labour force and/or are trafficked, placing them at greater risk for being exposed to other forms of maltreatment. Cultural norms endorsing the use of physical and emotional acts to discipline children further exacerbate this risk. Here, we assessed the rates of childhood victimisation experiences and associated mental health problems in Nepalese youth rescued from illegal child labour including trafficking. Methods: One hundred and three young people aged 12–18 years living in out-of-home care institutions and rescued from child labour/trafficking completed translated versions of selected modules from the Juvenile Victimisation Questionnaire, the Youth Inventory and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Care-home employees responsible for looking after the young people completed the Adolescent Symptom Inventory and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Analysis described maltreatment frequencies and compared individuals who had and had not experienced any form of maltreatment on the presence/absence of psychiatric diagnoses. Results: Seventy-two percent of participants experienced some form of maltreatment in their lifetime. Rates for each maltreatment type were 46.6% for physical abuse, 40.77% for emotional abuse, 27.2% for sexual abuse and 33% for neglect. Symptoms indicative of anxiety disorders and trauma were commonly reported especially in victims of childhood maltreatment. Conclusions: Our estimates of physical abuse in this at-risk juvenile sample were commensurate to those reported in general-population youth samples in Nepal, but sexual and emotional abuse rates were somewhat lower. The potential presence of anxiety and trauma in this sample that may result from maltreatment requires replication, but underscores an urgent need for routine mental health screening in rescued child labourers during rehabilitation efforts.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Before using this tool in any population, its validation needs to be assessed. This study was carried out to check validation in cardiac surgical patients in Nepalese patients. Method: This is a prospective observational analytical cohort study in 500 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement surgeries (mitral valve, aortic valve or double valve replacements) and valve and aorta replacement surgeries (Bentall procedure). The data were entered in the Microsoft excel software and were analyzed using Chi Square test from Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Version - 17) package. Calibration power and discriminative power were calculated. Result: The model’s validation was assessed by its calibration and discriminative power. Calibration power was assessed using Hosmer- Lemeshow test (Chi-square test). It gave P value of 0.14 indicating that the model adequately fits the data and can predict mortality. Discriminative power was assessed by calculating area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve which was 0.71 indicating satisfactory discriminative power. In low and moderate risk groups, observed and predicted (additive and logistic) mortality were satisfactory. In high risk group, observed mortality was higher than predicted mortality. Logistic EuroSCORE value was nearer to observed value. Conclusion: EuroSCORE can be applied in Nepalese cardiac surgical patients in low and moderate risk groups satisfactorily though additive EuroSCORE is better in prediction. In high risk groups, logistic and additive EuroSCORE under predicted outcome than the observed mortality. However logistic EuroSCORE was better in this group of patients.

A survey was conducted at Musikot, Western Rukum, Nepal in 2019 to analyze the economic results of vegetable seed production using a well-structured pre-tested questionnaire. The average landholding per household was 8.14 ropani (1 ropani = 0.05 ha), as 33.74% of landholding (equal to 50.36% of the cultivated land) was under vegetable seed production. Vegetable seed production generated 46% of on-farm income equal to 23% of total household income. The share of on-farm activities and off-farm activities in household income was almost equal. 64% of the farming households were food self-sufficient. 39% of the farmers were new to the vegetable seed production enterprise whereas 5% of the farmers were involved from 40 years. 49% of the cost in vegetable seed production was incurred in labor. About eight thousand rupee were sufficient to run a vegetable seed production enterprise per ropani that had made a gross margin of NRs 9,614.36 per ropani. Radish occupied 46.5% of the vegetable seed producing land and generated 53.5% of the vegetable seed revenue. BCR of 2.21 suggested that vegetable seed production enterprise brings NRs 2.21 at the investment of NRs 1.

The landslides had blocked the Pasang Lhamu Highway and dammed the Trishuli River at many places. A total of 1416 landslide locations were detected in the district from high resolution satellite images in Google Earth. In this study, landslide susceptibility was modeled in the Rasuwa District by considering slope, aspect, elevation, geology, peak ground acceleration (PGA), land use, drainage proximity and thrust proximity as the predictive factors for landslide occurrences. The landslide inventory was split into 70% and 30% portions as the training dataset and testing dataset respectively. The results from modified frequency ratio (FR) suggest that effect of geology with prediction rate 2.52 is the highest among all factors and is followed by elevation (2.38) and drainage proximity (2.12). The results were verified using area under curve (AUC) and the prediction rate was found to be 79.14%.

This research, conducted from February to July 2022 in West Nawalpur district, Nepal, aims to assess the productivity, profitability, and economics, including benefit-cost analysis, of wheat in West Nawalparasi. A total of 100 wheat farmers were selected and the data obtained were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The study reveals a positive gross margin (NRs 1113.09) and a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 1.6 per 0.3 hectare, indicating the profitability of wheat cultivation. Notably, most farmers procure agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizers from local agro-dealers within Nepal, highlighting a preference for domestic sources over imports from India. For irrigation, more than half of the population relies on pumps that draw from open water sources (59%) and use mechanization equipment such as tractors and combine harvesters for field activities. However, the study reveals the complexity of the challenges faced by wheat farmers. Chief among these are the unavailability of adequate irrigation facilities, untimely and inadequate access to agricultural inputs, disease and pest incidence, lack of training and extension services, and lack of mechanization and skilled labor. These constraints, as highlighted by the farmers, affect both productivity and profitability, highlighting the urgent need for initiatives to reduce production costs and improve wheat production in West Nawalparasi.",https://www.sagens.org/journal/agens/article/download/s2023010205/pdf,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Throughout the same period, negotiations between social groups and political institutions have been increasingly phrased in the language of rights, echoing the growing importance of the “rights-based” approach in the international development circuit.1 Although this is a general trend world-wide, what is peculiar to Nepal is that, besides articulating the dialectics of some of the major social conflicts unfolding in the country, the discourse on rights was also at the core of the drafting of the new constitution and one of the main tools of the “New Nepal” building process. In this article, I will underline three features of this discourse and its mobilization in Nepal. The first is its close connection with the sphere of law and, more generally, with legal discourse. Rights are indissolubly linked to the law and legal discourse is one of the frameworks within which the public debate unfolds in Nepal nowadays; as a result, the judiciary is playing an increasingly important role in social struggles. The centrality of law in the new form of the Nepali state was already stated in the preamble to the 1990 constitution, which solemnly underlines the commitment to “transform the concept of the Rule of Law into a living reality,” a commitment reiterated by the interim constitution (2007) and confirmed by the newly-promulgated constitution (2015). The second feature is the predominance of group rights over individual rights in the Nepali context; indeed, individual rights granted in the 1990 constitution had not proven very efficient in addressing the rights gap in Nepali society, and the debate over rights was dominated by the issue of group rights (Gellner 2001; Malagodi 2013), which became a central theme in the conflicts surrounding the drafting of the new constitution.2 The appropriation of the language of rights for collective action, by caste and ethnic groups and social movements alike, is also linked to the third feature: the growing presence in Nepalese public debate of allegedly non-political groups, such as civil society associations, organizations, federations, and the like, alongside political groups. These associations are admittedly constituted in order to “raise the voice” of the people they represent and to advocate for their recognition and rights in the public arena. These “voices,” however, need to be legitimized in order to impose their presence in the social field, and to establish their claims and viewpoints on social realities. Such a legitimization is sought by activists through different strategies and at different levels: the social, political, and legal ones. I will here give an example of these dynamics in the legal arena by considering the use of a specific tool, Public Interest Litigation (PIL). This tool was conceived to facilitate access to justice on behalf of marginal and disadvantaged sectors of the population, who were prevented from resorting to the courts by their weak social position and lack of education or by their lack of economic means.3 Through an analysis of one of these litigations, I suggest how local associations attempt to mobilize the power of the law to legitimize their own counter-discourse about rights, that is, their own “discourse of truth,” according to Foucault’s terminology, about a specific social reality. The question of “truth” is constantly highlighted by local associations, and can be considered a key term in their claims and self-representations (as well as one of the central issues in the debate on New Nepal). Beside the study of the structures underpinning discourses of “truth,” pertaining to the domain of epistemology, Foucault (2009) points out the interest of investigating forms and conditions through which the subject represents himself/herself and is recognized by others as saying the truth: following this approach, I will consider how the power of law is enlisted in the construction of discourses that are given, and are received, as discourses of “truth.” This power of the law cannot be overemphasized: as Bourdieu (1987) has shown, the law shares with other authoritative discourses the...",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The statistical analysis of collected field survey data was preformed through correlation test and standard deviation. The result shows that the socio-economic condition and the livelihood of the vegetable farmers is improving in recent years. Before doing commercial vegetable farming, farmers cultivated potatoes and used to exchange their production with cereal crops to the neighboring villages. Farmers used to cultivate maize in their farmland, but due to the climatic and the topographic condition it took almost nine months (from January to October) for production. Among the total households, 24.4 percent farmers have seven members in their family and the average family size is 6.3. The Chhetri is the dominant ethnic group of the study area.

Imminent water crisis due to climate change, water demanding nature of traditionally cultivated rice, increasing scarcity of labor and escalating labor costs drive the search for alternative management methods to increase water productivity, system sustainability and profitability in rice cultivation. Direct seeded rice (DSR) technique has received much attention and popularity nowadays because of its low-input demanding nature that can mitigate emission of green-house gases and adaption to climatic risks. DSR involves sowing of dry seed into a prepared seedbed, pre-germinated seed into a puddled soil surface and standing water. The development of early maturing varieties and use of efficient nutrient management practices along with increased adoption of integrated weed management techniques have encouraged many farmers to switch from transplanted to DSR culture. DSR technology is highly mechanized in some developed countries like USA, Australia, Japan, China, Korea etc. This shift from traditional rice to DSR will substantially reduce crop water requirements, soil organic-matter turnover, enhanced nutrient management, carbon sequestration, weed management, greenhouse-gas emissions and enhance crop intensification. However, weed and nematode infestation, blast, panicle sterility, lack of suitable varieties for DSR and lodging are major challenges. Based on existing evidences, this paper reviews the integrated package of technologies for DSR, potential advantages and challenges associated with it.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44786/33689,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Furthermore, the presence in various proportions of large grain sizes on hillslopes can amplify both landslide and flood hazards in largely unquantified ways. Boulders can have an immediate destructive potential on properties and infrastructure and can hinder response and recovery by blocking access routes, posing a challenge for removal. On entering the river network, they might have far reaching effects if remobilised in high flows, damaging or destroying key infrastructure such as hydropower plants and inducing significant knock-on effects on local economies. A fundamental step towards quantification of increased hazard potential is the understanding environmental controls on boulder production. Despite their potential to enhance hazard, the probability of large boulders being produced within different landslide types has not been directly accounted for in landslide hazard mapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study focuses on the upper Bhote Koshi catchment, northeast of Kathmandu (Nepal), characterised by extreme topographic gradients, seismicity and monsoonal climate, and subjected to frequent landslides and floods. This, coupled with increased population pressure and infrastructure growth, makes the area prone to natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used high resolution optical imagery to map more than 11300 boulders and analysed this large dataset in combination with lithology and topography, and well as structural and landslide data, to investigate controls on boulder production and grain size distributions in different lithological, structural and geomorphic settings of the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithology appears to exert a significant influence on boulder sizes, with statistically significantly larger boulders observed in crystalline rocks of the Higher Himalaya Sequence than in metasedimentary rocks of the Lesser Himalaya Sequence. We also observe that the spacing of the most pervasive fracture set, parallel to foliation, influences boulder size distributions in some lithologies, whilst other dominant regional fracture sets appear not to strongly correlate with mapped boulder sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although recent studies have shown the importance of structural control on boulder sizes, our large dataset reveals that for complex, high-relief landscapes, with high erosion rates, fracture characteristics do not fully explain grain size distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of processes involved in boulder production and transport on slopes, before reaching the river network, also appears to exert a control over grain size distributions and boulder density, with rockfall processes appearing to be responsible for producing boulders with largest sizes as opposed to rockslides, where the high energy and mode of transport is likely associated with increased fragmentation. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysing lithological and structural characteristics alone may not be sufficient to explain the observed distribution and would thus only give a limited insight in the enhanced hazard levels posed by boulders across different sectors of a landscape and other factors, such as distance from source and mode of transport at shorter temporal scales, must be taken into account. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Having high export potential and profitable to farmers, Ginger is an important spice crop of hills of central Nepal; however, ginger farmers continue to experience low productivity and were forced to share large profit with unscrupulous traders; further, they are traumatized by fluctuation of price and other problems. In this context, a study was undertaken in Sindhuli, a part of Central Nepal for analyzing value chain of ginger. A pretested semi-structured questionnaire was administered among 120 randomly selected farmers and 10 traders involved in ginger enterprise for the past two years. A face-to-face interview was scheduled to obtain data during October-November, 2018. Compound annual growth analysis revealed that area, production and yield of ginger were increasing at the rate of 1.73%, 1.65% and 0.95%, respectively, over the last seven years and price of ginger, over the past thirteen years, increasing at the rate of 3.28%. Value chain analysis revealed that producer, traders (wholesaler and exporter), retailer and consumer were the major actors involved. Farmers received substantial margin – 55% of the retail price, but the rest of the profit was shared to unscrupulous traders. B/C ratio of ginger farming in the study area was 2.42 revealing that ginger farming was a profitable business; with investment of Rs1.0 (0.0088US$) in ginger, farmers earned additional 1.42 rupees. Low productivity of ginger in the research area was caused by severe incidence of rhizome rot. In addition, price fluctuation, lack of processing and storing infrastructure, timely unavailability of rhizome seed, paucity of improved variety, and lack of farmers’ knowledge on improved cultivation practices were the major constraint of ginger farming. Overall, our study points out that solving the constraints, accessing new market, and organizing co-operatives are crucial for sustainable value chain development.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

To ensure the data's suitability for factor analysis using Principal Component Analysis, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, Bartlett's Sphericity test, inter-component correlations, and Cronbach alpha scores for internal consistency were checked, and principal components were extracted. A 25-item safety barrier to safety measures in building construction projects during the COVID-19 pandemic was identified through an extensive review of the literature; six components were retained using Principal Component Analysis which represented the model of choice and explained 62.86 % of the data variance. The components were; inappropriate safety guidelines, psychological working pressure, inadequate hygiene monitoring and control, lack of safety awareness, improper working culture, and insufficient planning and scheduling. The internal consistency for the retained components was high; Cronbach α scores ranged from 0.72 to 0.796. “Inappropriate Safety Guidelines” was the most critical barrier to implementing safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in building construction projects, according to the rankings of the six identified components. It is recommended that construction professionals and regulatory bodies prioritize the development and adherence to robust safety protocols tailored to pandemic conditions. Regularly updating and reinforcing these guidelines will be crucial in safeguarding the health and well-being of workers while ensuring project continuity.

It is the major component of feed for the livestock and poultry sectors. The current maize yield is unable to meet its increasing demand in Nepal. Hence, substantial quantities of maize are being imported to fill the gap. Accurate forecasting of maize cultivation area, production, and yield is critical for successful market stabilization and sustainable agricultural practice promotion.  Objective: The study aims to predict the cultivation area, production, and yield of maize in Nepal from 2023/24 to 2029/30 using appropriate Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. Materials and Methods: The study uses time series data from 1963/64 to 2022/23 covering maize area (ha), production (Mt), and yield (Mt/ha), obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development and Agriculture Information and Training Center. The Box-Jenkins methodology-based ARIMA model was used for modeling and forecasting the future time series data. The estimated models were further diagnosed to validate no significant autocorrelation among residuals. Results: The Box-Jenkins methodology demonstrated ARIMA (4, 1, 0), ARIMA (1, 1, 1) and ARIMA (1, 1, 1) models for forecasting maize cultivation area, production, and yield, respectively. The study predicts a 4.84% increase in maize cultivation area, a 6.83% rise in production, and a 3.17% improvement in yield from 2023/24 to 2029/30. However, these increases are not projected to meet Nepal's rising maize demand. Conclusion: The study findings are relevant for ensuring import/export management and implementing the price policy in Nepal. The research highlights the need for technological advancements and improved management practices in maize production to ensure long-term sustainability.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJS/article/download/73170/55965,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

As this added capacity is on the horizon, the Nepalese government needs to prioritize domestic utilization of generated power over exporting the excess generation to the international market. One of the means for this is introducing hydrogen technology in the Nepalese market. This paper discusses suitable hydrogen production methodology, particularly green hydrogen via electrolysis and further encompasses the areas of hydrogen where it could play a pivotal role in case of Nepal. Cost analysis of hydrogen production is also conducted for 50kW to 500kW system. However, as hydrogen technology is still in its infancy, a well-informed selection of technology should be emphasized for the production of hydrogen in the context of Nepal.

The mechanism of the LSL failure process is not well understood due to the different deformation stages controlled by geological structures and causative/ triggering factors. Regional tectonic structures and local rock mass characteristics play a vital role in the formation of LSLs. Engineering geological characterization was performed to evaluate the rock/soil properties, and the associated state of danger (cracks, seepage, etc.). The rock mass rating (RMR) and geological strength index (GSI) methods were used to estimate rock mass quality and strength parameters. The estimated strength parameters together with laboratory test data were used to set up a two-dimensional (2D) landslide surface to simulate the failure scenarios. The simulation of landslide models was iterated under different loading conditions by incorporating geological heterogeneities. The results have demonstrated that the movement of the slope was affected by different stress conditions over time, which were verified using spatiotemporal landslide data. The landslide exhibited a three-stage failure mechanism with the development of tension-induced cracking at the rear and shearing failure of the critical locking section in the middle section. The tension shear and joint-step-path rupture along joint surfaces occurred during different stages of the landslide failure processes. The simulated results showed that the genetic development of LSL is mainly attributed to the geological structures and sudden changes in stress conditions. Thus, the research outcomes can be illustrative to evaluate the role of geological discontinuities, geotechnical parameters and triggering effects by the numerical simulation techniques for the failure mechanism of LSLs.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57921/43297,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Nepal is considered one of the five countries most vulnerable to climate change in the world. The mountainous area such as Rasuwa District in Nepal is more vulnerable due to complex topography, human activity (tourism), and climate change. In this context, we carried out this study to assess the climate change and its impact on agriculture production as well as people's perceptions on the impact of climate change. The long-term (1980–2014) observed climate data (temperature and precipitation) and field-based survey data on people's perceptions were analyzed. Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope estimation were used to analyze the temperature and precipitation trends. Furthermore, key informant interviews (KIIs) and focal group discussions (FGDs) were conducted to understand people's perceptions of the impact of climate change on agricultural production. Further, ERA5 and APHRODITE datasets were used to compare the in situ climate data. The maximum temperature and total precipitation in summer monsoon (June–September) were found increasing significantly at rates of 0.07°C/a and 19.89 mm/a, respectively. But the minimum winter temperature and winter precipitation were found decrease by 0.05°C/a and 4.89 mm/a, respectively. Moreover, a large number of respondents reported a decrease in millet and wheat productions while an increase in potato production over the considered time duration (1990–2014). It is noteworthy that the respondents from the mid-elevation regions perceived an increasing trend in crop production compared to those from the low elevation regions. In recent years, people living in the high elevation regions of Rasuwa District have started to shift their cropping calendar to increase agricultural production.

This study aimed to analyze the technical efficiency of the lentil production system and its determinants. A multistage sampling technique was employed to select respondent farmers from four districts representing three provinces in Nepal. Primary data were collected through face-to-face interviews with randomly selected 473 respondents using a semi-structured interview schedule. To derive the results, the stochastic production frontier and Tobit model were adopted. The average lentil output in the study area was found 672.6 ​kg ha-1 and the input variables such as seed, labor, tractor use, and area were the significant inputs increasing the output of lentils. The mean technical efficiency percentage for the pooled sample was 61.5% with a range between 23.0% and 89.9%. Further, the result revealed that average-performing farmers and least-performing farmers need to reduce their costs by 42.82% and 85.65%, respectively to attain the status of the most efficient farmer. Education, membership in groups and cooperatives, weeding practice, use of improved seed, and lentil farm size were found as determinants of technical efficiency in lentil production and unit increment of those variables favor lentil yield by 0.3%, 2.6%, 21.5%, 3.1%, and 3.1% respectively. As there is room to increase lentil output by using inputs efficiently, the government and related stakeholders should motivate farmers to get involved in groups and cooperatives to pool resources together and share information. Based on the results, with the application of current available resources farmers are strongly recommended to maintain their lentil farm size between 0.5 and 1 ​ha, use improved varietal seed, and also follow at least one weeding operation to increase their farm technical efficiency level by 21.5%.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2949911923000473,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The heavy reliance of industries on fossil fuels (63.4%) despite the abundance of hydroelectricity poses an additional challenge to the green transition of Nepal. The presented work aims to study the possibility of storing and utilizing spilled hydroelectricity due to runoff rivers as a compatible alternative to imported petroleum fuels. This is achieved by converting green hydrogen from water electrolysis and carbon dioxide from carbon capture of hard-to-abate industries into synthetic methane for heating applications via the Sabatier process. An economy-of-scale study was conducted to identify the optimal scale for the reference case (Industries in Makwanpur District Nepal) for establishing the Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) production industry. The techno-economic assessment was carried out for pilot scale and reference scale production unit individually. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed to study the project profitability and the sensitivity of the parameters influencing the feasibility of the production plant. The reference scale for the production of Synthetic Natural Gas was determined to be 40 Tons Per Day (TPD), with a total capital investment of around 72.15 Million USD. Electricity was identified as the most sensitive parameter affecting the levelized cost of production (LCOP). The 40 TPD plant was found to be price competitive to LPG when electricity price is subsidized below 3.55 NPR/unit (2.7 c/unit) from 12 NPR/unit (9.2 c/unit). In the case of the 2 TPD plant, for it to be profitable, the price of electricity must be subsidized to well below 2 NPR/kWh. The study concludes that the possibility of SNG production in Nepal is profitable and price-competitive at large scales and at the same time limited by the low round efficiency due to conversion losses. Additionally, it was observed that highly favorable conditions driven by government policies would be required for the pilot-scale SNG project to be feasible.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2024.1347255/full,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

However, most studies on remittances are focused on the ex-post analysis of the economy and few studies focus on the planning and policy issues aimed to utilize remittances. This paper reviews literature on utilizing remittance money and analyzes the prospects of capitalizing remittances in Nepal. A conceptual model is proposed on utilizing remittance money for infrastructure development. The proposed model of a remittance investment trust aims to synergize the three best attributes of the three domains of stakeholders, namely, abundant remittance money of the people, excellent management skills of the private sector, and the superior public trust to the government. Remittance money can serve as a great investment vehicle for executing properly investigated and attractive infrastructure projects.

For the purpose of this paper research article found through google search and freely available to download or paper author has access is used. Population aging is directly related with the fertility and mortality of the country. Latest trend shows both fertility and mortality are decreasing and average life expectancy as well as proportion of older population is increasing in Nepal. Statistics shows elderly population proportion is increasing and expected to reach 10% of total population in the 2021 census. Aging has resulted problems on social-cultural, economic, demographic, labour, health and care of the elderly. The social security of the elderly is major concern with aging population. But the government has not given adequate priority to the issues of elderly and their social security as well. Government needs to identify the issues of elderly and need to develop sustainable policies for the quality-of-life increasing aging populations.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The hydro-geochemical assessment of the groundwater is the basic part of the water resources management and its assessment in regards to its usability is considered vital. The study involves the measurement of physicochemical parameters (pH, EC, EH, DO, TDS) of the observed 147 springs and the ionic concentration of the representative 32 springs along the Mai Khola Watershed using standard analytical procedure. The results of the physicochemical parameters and ionic concentration were analysed and interpreted using different indices and graphical methods. The physicochemical parameter suggests that spring water is weakly acidic to alkaline and the measured EC and TDS suggest low interaction of rocks and water therein. The piper diagram indicates Ca2+ and Mg2+ together (alkaline earth metals) dominate over combined Na+ and K+ (alkali metals) and Cl- and SO42- (strong acids) predominate over HCO3- (weak ones). The Gibbs plot also satisfies the movement of groundwater from the precipitation domain to the rock-water interaction domain. The groundwater in this area is derived from a shallow aquifer with low rock-water interaction and the water is good for drinking purpose and excellent to good for irrigation.

Human population data was collected from the population censuses. Field observation and information collected from the field to verify ground reality in 15 different watersheds. This study revealed that there is a significant increase in natural vegetation in all parts of the watershed. However, there is the highest rate of increase in vegetation in lower plain areas, where the population density is the highest. The overall increase in natural vegetation is because of the decreasing human and livestock population, changes in lifestyle, etc. The highest increase in natural vegetation in lower plain areas is because of the alternative use of cooking energy and building materials in urban and accessible areas, decreasing the number of livestock. Thus, it can be concluded that there is a significant impact of population dynamics on vegetation in the Madi Watershed of Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/53490/40066,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The steel industry is a highly energy-intensive sector that alone is responsible for utilizing 8 % of global energy demand and accounts for 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), United Nations Sustainable development goals-2030 (SDG), United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Paris agreement have directed to take necessary measures to confine global temperature rise to below 2°C till 2050. Green hydrogen is the most prominent energy carrier and with the help of renewable hydroelectricity to produce it, Nepal has the potential to be the cheapest producer and exporter of green hydrogen. Billet worth 865 USD was imported in 2020 to fulfil the annual steel demand of 1.2-1.4 million tons. Nepal has explored iron reserves (hematite) with a total Fe recovery potential of 70% which is sufficient to fulfil the steel demand of 50-100 years at Dhaubadi, Nawalparasi, and has prevailing iron reserves in other parts of Nepal. The history of steel production in Nepal has been studied and the reasons for the discontinuation have been analyzed. Secondary data from the literature and archival data have been used as methods to conduct the research. The status of energy demand and supply in Nepal and the energy management issues in Nepal during the wet season have been identified as opportunities to establish green hydrogen production in Nepal. The urgency to establish the steel industry and the need for compliance with climate change agreements are the motivation for the adoption of a green steel production process for Nepal. This paper reviews the current status and opportunities of the steel industry in Nepal using green hydrogen and proposes the future prospects and challenges that come along.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2629/1/012026/pdf,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Two major difficulties that arise while fitting a multiple regression model for forecasting are selecting 'potential predictors' from numerous possible variables to influence on the forecast variable and investigating the most appropriate model with a subset of the potential predictors.Objective: Purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a procedure adopted while fitting multiple regression model (with an attempt to optimize) for rice production forecasting in Nepal.Materials and Methods: This study has used fifty years (1961-2010) of time series data. A list of twenty-one predictors thought to impact on rice production was scanned based upon past literature, expert's hunches, availability of the data and the researcher's insight which left eleven possible predictors. Further, these possible predictors were subjected to family of automated stepwise methods which left five ‘potential predictors’ namely harvested area, rural population, farm harvest price, male agricultural labor force and, female agricultural labor force. Afterwards, best subset regression was performed in Minitab Version 16 which finally left three 'appropriate predictors' that best fit the model namely harvested area, rural population and farm harvest price.Results: The model fit was significant with p < .001. Also, all the three predictors were found highly significant with p < 0.001. The model was parsimonious which explained 93% variation in rice production with 54% overlapping predictive work done. Forecast error was less than 5%.Conclusion: Multiple regression model can be used in rice production forecasting in the country for the enhanced ease and efficiency.Nepalese Journal of Statistics, Vol. 2, 89-98",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJS/article/download/21157/17334,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Different direct actors and organizations were found to be involved in micro, meso and macro levels of the mandarin value chain. The technical structure of the mandarin value chain was found as the input provision, mandarin production, intermediary trading, retailing, and consumption. The value chain was linked to different regions of the country. On an average, mandarin producers incurred total variable cost of NRs 10.40 per kg of mandarin. Their gross margin was NRs 8.44 per kg of mandarin. The cost of marketing of the traders, wholesalers, and retailers were NRs 3.56, 5.38 and 1.98 per kg of mandarin respectively whereas the margins of each of them were NRs 2.54, 2.36 and 5.01 per kg of mandarin respectively. The role of traders was found dominant in both purchasing of mandarin from producers and supplying to other districts. The majority of producers were not getting adequate training, support and supervision from concerned organizations. The major weakness in mandarin value chain was unorganized marketing system. Intermediaries and retailers were always found to be in profit. Therefore, the concerned organizations should bring policies in fixing the market price of mandarin based on cost of production.

Using a pre-tested questionnaire, primary data and information were collected from 300 lentil grain producing farmers, categorized by local seed users, improved seed users, and 100 seed producing farmers in Kailali, Dang, and Siraha districts. The study revealed that the B:C ratio in lentil seed production was higher (1.59) than in lentil grain production (1.41). The benefit in both grain and seed production realized by farmers was mainly due to increased prices rather than production. Return to scale was found to be increasing (1.016) in lentil grain production using local seed, but it was decreasing at a rate in lentil grain production using improved seed (0.854) and in lentil seed production (0.822). Analysis on resource use efficiency revealed that labor input is excessively overused, reflecting the Marginal Value Product of less than unity in lentil production. To get the maximum profit from lentil grain production using improved seed, input use in land preparation, threshing, and post-harvest should be increased while decreasing the amount of other inputs.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNARC/article/download/44865/33727,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The abundance of lactose and other organic compounds in whey contributes to its elevated Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), further straining natural ecosystems. This study aimed to investigate the nutritional potential of whey and its conversion into value-added products: bioethanol and probiotic drinks. To achieve this, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis strains, isolated from soil samples in Nepal, were co-cultured with Lactobacillus sp. and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the whey broth for fermentation. Ethanol distillation was done using a rotary evaporator to maintain the viability of the fermenting organisms in the broth. Moreover, the probiotic criteria of the fermenting strains were extensively examined. Experimental observations revealed a remarkable concentration of 9.2 g/L of ethanol, resulting in an ethanol yield of 0.23 g/L (42% compared to theoretical yield). Extrapolating this rate, it is theoretically possible to produce an annual global bioethanol output of 5 million tons using whey as a sustainable and abundant resource. Furthermore, the study explores novel advancements in the distillation process, demonstrating the successful extraction of ethanol at room temperature. Additionally, the fermentation organisms employed in this research exhibit robust viability, surviving various in-vitro stresstolerance tests, including temperature, bile salt, pH fluctuations, and gastric juice. These resilient strains also demonstrated long-term stability in fermented whey broth, making them promising candidates for the development of probiotic beverages.

Objective: To measure the prevalence of mental problems among old people in a community setting. Methodology: All people of age ≥ 60 years from ‘Urlabari’, a city in eastern Nepal, being members of a local old-age committee were called to participate in this study. A total of 140 old people attended a health-camp and with informed written consent and authority approval, the response to the GHQ-12 and demographic information were collected. The GHQ-12 score ≥2 was adopted for ‘psychiatric caseness’ analysis. However, people with scores ≥4 were assessed by a psychiatrist for further evaluation and management. Diagnoses were made according the ICD-10. Results: Majority (87%) were in age groups of (61-70) and (71-80) years. Many (44%) had stressors, common being: dispute with family, illness and death of close person. Many old people had health complaints; mainly physical/ somatic, mood and anxiety symptoms. About 2/5th subjects 55 (39.29%) had GHQ-12 score ≥2 and 26.43% had ≥3; i.e. ‘psychiatric caseness’. Among the subjects with score ≥4 (23) assessed for psychiatric diagnosis, 21 (91.30%) had some ICD-10 diagnosis. Depression, adjustment and anxiety disorders were common diagnoses, and 2% had suicidality. Conclusion: A remarkable proportion of old people had current ‘psychiatric caseness’.

The disease affects the rural poor socio-economical community causing significant death among untreated patients (Per capita income of Nepal US $ 400.00). An effort was made to estimate treatment cost on clinically diagnosed VL patients in three VL endemic districts of Eastern development region of Nepal.Materials & Methods: During one and half year period in 2012/2013, approximately 500 cases were diagnosed as VL from three district hospitals; two zonal hospitals and one tertiary level hospital of Eastern Terai districts of Nepal. Total 172 cases were selected randomly from the three VL endemic districts of Eastern Nepal and interviewed at their homes. Results: On an average, cost for VL treatment during hospitalization was Nepali Rupees (NRS) 4032.67±313.47, where median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 17 (five to 35) days. The patients were  iagnosed symptomatically as VL after 45 ± 6 days of feeling illness. The treatment cost of patient before diagnosis was NRS 2379.93 ± 202.30. Patient reached the treatment center after 17 ± 2 days of diagnosis and referral from community level. Total 83.7% patients came for follow-up after average 30 ± 2 days of discharge with an average expense of RS 360.34 ± 49.88. The death rate of VL patients during treatment and within one month of discharge was 7.6%. It was found that the average funeral cost was NRs 9598.00 ± 1259.00. Conclusion: This study concludes that, average treatment cost for VL treatment during hospital stay was NRs 4032 and before treatment was around NRS 2380 and follow up cost was NRs 360. Early diagnosis and treatment in treatment center without significant delay can not only reduce the hospital stay and treatment cost, but also saves life of VL patients.JCMS Nepal. 2016;12(2):60-5",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JCMSN/article/download/15454/12556,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Altogether, 120 large cardamom growers and 20 traders were selected using purposive sampling technique. Data were analysed using SPSS and Ms-Excel. Cobb-Douglas production function was used to estimate the factor share to the total output production. Findings revealed that more than 45% of total annual household income was attributed by cardamom itself. Overall benefit and cost ratio was found greater than unity (1.467). Cobb-Douglas production function showed that all cardamom-growing farmers were experiencing increasing returns to scale. Higher producer’s share (90.32%) was found when farmer sell their large cardamom directly to the exporter while least producer’s share (69.21%) was found in domestic market channel with large number of intermediaries. Increase in marketing margin, marketing costs and decrease in marketing efficiency and producers’ share were observed with increase in number of marketing intermediaries and vice-versa.

An investigation of diurnal cycle of precipitation revealed an afternoon maximum during the pre-monsoon season (March–May) and midnight–early morning maximum during the summer monsoon season (June–August)over the southern slopes of the Himalayas. The summer monsoon exhibited a robust spatial variation of diurnal cycle of precipitation, during afternoon-evening time, primary rainfall peak appeared along the Lesser Himalayas (~2,000–2,200 m above mean sea level), while early-morning rain in contrast showed maximum concentration along the southern margin of the Himalayas (~500–700 m above MSL). An afternoon-evening rainfall peak was attributed to higher rain frequency, whereas early-morning rainfall peak was attributed to fewer but rather intense rainfall. It is suggested that, confluence between down slope and moist south easterly monsoon flow triggers convection near the foothills of the Himalayas during early morning period.

Phenomenologists concentrate on the structures of consciousness as individuals experienced and expressed while turning an objective world or phenomenon into a subjective one through objectivation, internalization and externalization/ institutionalization process. The structuralist holds that the creation of an institution is a reproduction of interaction between structures and actors. And other theorists (e.g., Leach et al., 1999; Ostrom 2005, 2009; Gupta et al., 2010; Young, 2010) consider that institutions for natural resources conflate with social institutions and mediate their relations. Although these theories are not explicit epistemologically in a pragmatic sense, they have indicated language, rules, (embedded) practices and knowledge are the referential artifacts of institutions. These theories are found applicable in the institutionalization/socialization history of CF as it had gone through the social rejection (i.e, objectivation) during the 1970s, internalization during the 1980s, and socialization of it during and after the 1990s. The socialization of CF after the 1990s was due to the formation of CF as a social space (a ‘structure’ or ‘institution’) to discuss social and environmental issues into one place where forest dependent users (‘actors’) rationalize the use of forest and its conservation for local environment in a more pragmatic sense (i.e., mediate people-nature relations). An institution for natural resources is, therefore, the combined perspectives of phenomenologists, structuralists, and those who think institutions as a mediator of people-nature relations. Thus, an institution is political (i.e., relations and interactions) and ecological/economic (i.e., access to natural resources, livelihood practices).",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/35547/27788,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

To understand the seed value chain of the Srijana hybrid tomato, a survey was conducted in 2014/15 with public research and extension institutions, private seed companies/firms, non-governmental organization and community group including individual farmers, involved in Srijana tomato seed production. The survey covered random selection of 30 agro-vets and 30 farmers in Kathmandu valley, Kavre, Nuwakot, Dolakha and Kaski districts, Nepal where production of Srijana tomato seed is mostly concentrated. A focus group discussion was also conducted with commercial tomato farmers in each of the study districts. The study showed a total production of 293 kg Srijana seed having a value of around 47 million Nepalese Rupees (US $ 470 thousands) in year 2013/14. Private sector was the dominant actor sharing about 85% of the total Srijana seed production followed by non-governmental organization (10%), farmers group (3%) and governmental station/farm/centers (2%), respectively. Out of the total Srijana seed produced, about 95% was consumed in domestic market while 5% was exported to India. The study revealed increasing trend of production, supply and price of Srijana tomato seed. About 0.3 million NRs (US $ 3,000) profit was estimated through the production of Srijana tomato seed in 0.05 hectares (500 m2) of land. Agro-vets (private sector seed dealers) were the major actors for supplying the seed from the producers to farms and received a higher profit margins. The farmers producing and selling the seed in technical assistance of public agencies received higher producer`s share (66.6%) than farmers producing and selling seed through own group (60%), technical assistance of non-governmental organization (53.3%), and in contract with private seed companies (26.7%). Majority of commercial tomato farmers had complaints on supply of poor quality seed in the market. As a result, there was declining faith on the quality of Srijana tomato seed. Limited access to parental lines and poor availability of skilled human resources were the key constraints to produce the quality Srijana seed. Therefore, it is recommended that there should be a provision of efficient quality control mechanisms, and development of human resources including public private partnerships for maintaining the genetic purity of parental lines and also improving the capacities of seed value chain actors for sustainable Srijana seed production in Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNARC/article/download/16114/13259,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The results showed that farmers mostly adopted GAP such as frequent weeding, intercropping, and nutrient management in apple orchards. Based on the negative binomial regression estimates, household characteristics such as gender of the orchard owner, experience, and number of literate household members were found influential in determining the GAP adoption intensity. The analysis of the problem severity index implied that apple production is mostly constrained by limited access to production inputs and transportation. The findings provide useful insights to the farmers and policymakers regarding the current scenario of GAP adoption along with the diversity of barriers that severely limits the realization of apple production potential in western Nepal.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S240584402406256X,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Laparoscopic techniques have become an integral part of the operative management in virtually every realm of general surgery. The success of the laparoscopic technique has been due mainly to patient demand, which has contributed to a rapid expansion in the number of laparoscopic procedures performedThe benefits conferred to patients by less invasive procedures like decreased pain, and shorter recovery time have to be weighed against overzealous application and the problems created by the lack of familiarity with new techniques and instruments.

Parcel fragmentation is the division of a parcel into two or more parcels. This research was carried out to analyse the current status of parcel fragmentation in Nepal. According to the findings of this research, parcel fragmentation in Nepal is haphazard mainly focussing on urban and peri urban arears consequently parcel being irregular in shape & smaller in size and ultimately incrementing huge number of land owners with in fixed area. In the context of Nepal, factors that drive parcel fragmentation are cultural, social, legal, economical, frequent disasters, geographic variations, unmanaged migrations, haphazard land use planning amongst others. The uncontrolled and unmanaged parcel fragmentation in Nepal is the major challenge for land use planning and its implementation. Dense parcel fragmentation has created land related disputes. it is recommended that the government should reformulate and implement the proper land use policy as well as its supporting acts that encourage landconsolidation in agricultural zone and reducing haphazard parcel fragmentation in urban and peri urban areas.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJG/article/download/50885/38021,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Maize constitutes at least 50% of the total ingredients in poultry feed, with approximately 3,000 tons of poultry feed consumed daily in Nepal. However, while the demand for feed is increasing at about 10.0% per annum, maize production is only growing at 2.5% per annum. The low productivity with inferior grain quality and a lack of value chain coordination mechanisms starting from inputs (seeds) to output (grains) have hindered the commercialization of the domestic maize sector. Because of the inefficient market mechanism and competitive market structure, farmers are not able to pursue commercial maize production. To address this issue, action research on the value chain was conducted by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), focusing mainly on Sudurpaschim and Lumbini provinces, to implement the maize commercialization model (MCM) between 2020 and 2022. Results demonstrate that public-private partnership approach can increase maize production, improve farm gate prices and farmers’ incomes, improve value chain coordination; improve access to services to farmers and enhance information flow among stakeholders. The study recommends that policies aimed to streamline commercial maize production should adopt a value chain approach, with a focus on chain upgrading and governance and promote coordination among actors to scale up commercial maize production throughout the maize-growing areas of Nepal.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Million liters of edible oil used for cooking foods and date expired oils from oil manufacturers are discarded into sewage. This study primarily intends to study the feasibility of biodiesel production using such waste oils. In this work, biodiesel was prepared from waste cooking oils by a process called transesterification with NaOH as a catalyst. Our results showed that methyl ester (biodiesel) (92.67±0.90%), soap materials (1.33±0.224%) and glycerol (6±0.68%) were obtained after the transesterification of waste cooking oil. The physicochemical properties of biodiesel such as density, viscosity, volatility, surface tension and flashpoint were analyzed, which were found to be 0.862±0.006 g/cm3, 2.23±0.021 cP, 0.327×10-3±4.5×10-6 g/s, 32.03±0.138 dyne/cm, 169.67±0.810°C, respectively. These properties were compared with that of commercial diesel as well as with the values specified by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D6751. The density and the surface tension of the biodiesel were found similar to that of petrodiesel but its volatility was 3 times lower. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the biodiesel showed methyl ester functional group at 1436 cm-1. Based on the cost of the materials used for production, the cost of biodiesel was estimated to be about 81 Nepalese rupees (0.67 USD) per liter. The properties of biodiesel also met the standard values of ASTM D6751. These findings indicate that waste oil is one of the feasible biodiesel sources and it can be used as a suitable alternative to petrodiesel.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJB/article/download/33661/26577,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Nepal’s response to the US-led Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) signifies the same. For Nepal, crossing seas was culturally associated with sin as an objective to fulfill the isolationist policy adopted until the political change of 1950. As such, Nepal’s interaction with the sea was not so friendly in the past. However, these historical shreds of evidence cannot suffice as the reason behind her denial of joining the IPS. Most of the available literature divulges the sensitive geographical position of Nepal in the context of the rise of China and the projection of a ‘new Cold War’ for its reluctance to join the Indo-Pacific strategy. However, they fail to probe into the domestic intricacies contributing to the hesitation. In this context, this paper primarily tries to dwell upon the actors and factors that have influenced Nepal’s dubiety in joining the Indo-Pacific Strategy. Thus, this paper aims to fulfill two objectives. First, to analyze the role of geographical sensitivity, and second, to scrutinize the domestic interplay of things. As exploratory qualitative research, this study reviews the official documents, agreements, statements, speeches, and reports from think tanks and newspapers to hypothesize that besides external factors there are integral internal elements that have played a part in Nepal’s denial to join the strategic partnership.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

In Nepal, the primary source of income is covered through agriculture-based activities where about 2/3rd of the country’s population depends. This review assesses the current status of fish production in Nepal, highlighting trends, challenges, and opportunities. According to recent data, it shows the fisheries sector contributed 0.44% to GDP and 1.83% to AGDP. Madesh Province is at the top in both production and productivity with 44,170 mt. and 5,787 kg/ha. The total fish production in Bara district is highest with 11,675 mt. (7,202 kg/ha). Secondary information sources about fish and fish products were gathered from online and print sources like articles, journals, and official reports and were reviewed. The trend of fish production is increasing in Nepal. Mainly from India, China, and Bangladesh, Nepal imports more fish and fish products than imports. The analysis underlines the need for government intervention to support local production, increase productivity, and ensure the sustainability of the fishing industry. Most farmers practice carp polyculture, and the production area is distributed only in the Terai region. Recent indication in increasing the area of production in fisheries shows the country is moving toward self-sustainability in fish production.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

If one looks at the total quantum of water that flows out of Nepal in one year, the above message sounds valid but as the flow of water is not under anybody’s control and flow occurs under gravity as it precipitates or exits the water springs, it should be considered in two dimensions: volume and time. In my opinion, Nepal is water stressed most of the time of year: flood stressed during the monsoon and drought stressed during the rest of the year. Nepal is rich in ice-mass, which is depleting at an alarming rate due to global warming giving rise to formation and increase in volume of glacial lakes that increases the vulnerability and risks to the economic activities along the river basins. Similarly, Nepal is rich ing round water resource with the total annual replenish able reserve of about 12 BCM mostly located in the Terai plains. The most debatable is the surface water that mostly falls as rain during the monsoon and cascades down crossing into India, is often devastating, as it passes. Nepal’s water resource is generally related to its hydropower potential calculated as 83,000MW by Dr. Hari Man Shrestha back in the sixties. Hydropower potential is a number that is based on the energy potential and the market, therefore, it is changing from time to time due to change in demand pattern and the market rates. Myopic view of looking at the Himalayan waters relating it to energy production as the energy production (TAF-June 2018) comprises a meager percentage of total benefit which lies mostly on multiple use of water directed towards the following two aspects: (1)Reduction in the losses of life and property due to floods and unwanted mountain phenomenon, mostly flood related disaster risk reduction, and (2) Flood Water management for converting the curse of floods into assets by way of its multiple uses, both consumptive as well as non-consumptive including food revolution, navigation, fishery, water supply, replenishment of ground water, energy production and recreation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/24569/20671,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Research related to these risk behaviors especially among adolescents is essential considering their role as future citizens of the country.Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the burden of cardiovascular risk behavior amongst the adolescents of Kaski district, Lekhnath Nepal.Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out among the adolescents of Lekhnath Muncipality Kaski District. Total 350 participants from five different schools from Lekhnath Muncipality took part in the study and the sampling technique was simple random method by using a random number table. Self administered questionnaires were used to collect information on identification of risk behaviors.Results: Descriptive statistics and Chi square test were computed. Out of 350 adolescents 175 males and remaining 175 females were interviewed. Alcohol and tobacco consumption were more amongst males whereas fast food and soft drinks were more amongst the females. Nearly 40% of the adolescents were not involved in physical activity. Tobacco and alcohol consumption was 26% and 16% respectively, which was higher amongst the late adolescents group studying in the 11th and 12th standard. In this study fruits and vegetables consumption was very less only 42% whereas soft drinks and fast food consumption was more 83% which shows that the adolescents are not aware about their food habits. Some participants did not consume fruits due to low purchasing power to buy fruits. Adolescence is a period of experimentation and so some participants told that they have just started taking alcohol and also started consuming tobacco for fun and were not aware that it was cardiovascular risk behavior.Conclusions: The adolescents had a high burden of cardiovascular risk behavior and if immediate intervention is not done to reduce these high risk behaviors many may be vulnerable to cardio vascular diseases in the future. J-GMC-N | Volume 11 | Issue 01 | January-June 2018, Page: 10-13",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/20787/17069,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

So, ownership of land has multi-faceted understanding around the world. For the developing country like Nepal having diverse societal arrangements, land tenure system plays important role in economic, social and political structure. As Nepal is in the process of implementing federalization, assessment of land tenure security shall be one of the instruments for developing new land related policies and assessing the effect of new policies afterward. The objective of this paper is to perform SWOT analysis on the status of land tenure security in Nepal by reviewing the history of the tenure system and current tenure system, studying country reports and research papers and analyzing policies and institutions. The study shows that despite some initiatives by government, NGOs, bilateral agencies and media to improve land tenure security, land tenure insecurity prevails in all areas of the country even in registered lands. It is found that stable  rganization, registration of most of the built-up and cultivated land, advocacy to protect the right of landless has strengthened the land tenure security. However, the tenure rights of socially and economically disadvantaged people and displaced people from disasters have not been properly addressed and those people are at high risk of eviction from the place they are living. The study recommends that land tenure insecurity arising from political, legislative and organizational behavior should be managed by appropriate interventions and policy reforms. As most of the analyses of land tenure security in Nepal have been performed in a descriptive way, this study explicitly investigates the issue through SWOT analysis.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJG/article/download/23005/19537,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Working from post-structural perspectives, this meta-ethnographic review explores how such health research in Nepal engages with the epistemological, methodological, and ethical questions it encounters. Five databases including Nepali NepJOL were searched for studies from inception to March 2021. The review included seven studies covering women's group co-production, interviews guided by photo-elicitation, observational methods to explore maternal and child health, mental health, and environmental determinants of health. This meta-ethnography identified that, against the background of a pluralist heritage of health practices, global collaborations involving Nepali researchers and practitioners used participatory research methodology to work with the local populations to improve health and co-production seek primarily to promote Western biomedical and psychosocial interventions. Both advantages and disadvantages were acknowledged. Empirical verification and global acceptance of Western biomedical and psychosocial knowledge were seen as beneficial. Moreover, Western biomedicine was perceived by some as more effective than some local practices in improving health; nevertheless, Nepal faces many challenges that neither can address alone. For participatory and co-productive approaches to become epistemologically enculturated within Nepali health research, researchers need to co-develop more local models and methods which are culturally sensitive and appropriate. Meaningful and effective participatory research can promote active involvement of people who deliver as well as people who use the community-based health care support. These are crucial to optimise sustainable change that global health research partnerships set out to achieve. This meta-ethnography recommends that researchers engage at a deeper level with the epistemological differences between themselves and the communities with whom they seek partnership. Cross-cultural research teams should discuss and address the power differentials which might affect them.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0277953622002611,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

In the countries of South-East Asia region, Kala-azar occurs mainly in three countries- India, Bangladesh and Nepal. The disease occurs in agricultural villages where houses are frequently constructed with mud walls. Even people residing in endemic areas have poor practices for its prevention. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 150 community people of Katahari Gaupalika, Morang. Simple Random sampling technique was used for the selection of three wards among seven wards, probability proportionate was used for the selection of the population from the ward. The desired sample was selected purposively. Data were collected from face-to-face interview techniques using a structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done by using SPSS 16 version. Results It is found that nearly two-thirds of the respondents (63.3%) had moderate awareness, more than one-fifth (22%) of the respondents had adequate awareness while (14.7%) of the respondents had inadequate awareness of Kala-azar. Similarly, more than half (55.3%) had moderate preventive practice, (25.3%) had inadequate preventive practice and nearly one-fifth (19.3%) had adequate preventive practice. The mean score for awareness and practice was 16.633 and 5.54 respectively. Conclusion The study was conducted to assess the level of awareness of Kala-azar. This concluded moderate awareness of respondents on Kala-azar which suggested that there is still a need to improve the awareness of the respondents particularly on its causative agent, preventive measures and complication.

Methods: We used the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) dataset in this analysis. According to World Health Organization (WHO), pneumonia is diagnosed in under five population as having cough and / or difficult breathing, with / without fever. We considered pneumonia if at least two of these symptoms were present.

However, adoption of seed production technology is very limited in spite of its potential, which results in the poor supply of quality seed for its multiplication. Thus, this paper examines the influencing factors affecting farmers’ decision to adopt the foundation rice seed production in Kailali, Nepal. In total 158 households, 116 certified, and 42 foundation seed producers were selected using a stratified random sampling technique. The primary data were collected from September to November 2021. T-test, chi-square, and binary logistic model were applied for data analysis using SPSS. The result revealed that land size, experience, gender of household head, access to credit, training, extension contact, and type of family are statistically significant between two categories. Besides, the empirical result of logistic regression analysis indicated that out of twelve, six explanatory variables such as age, experience, training, extension contact, education, and type of family had significantly influence on adoption decision. Therefore, it is concluded the rice seed training programs and increasing the extension services would be beneficial to motivate the farmers for the production of foundation rice seed production.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/jafu/article/download/48442/36153,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The basic elements of environmental justice movements can be traced back to social movements of several decades ago – whether passive or active. In the past, collective action represented mainly a concern for access to land and other natural resources for the survival of marginalized groups that included women, lower castes, and indigenous peoples. In the repressive Rana and Panchayat regimes prior to 1990, resistance was passive or just symbolic, and movements were sporadic and localized. However, particularly since 1990, as urbanization and industrialization increased along with the use of chemicals and other substances, some of which are also detrimental to human health, social movements have also been organized to resist the maldistribution of new pollutants and hazardous substances in the society affecting the poor as well as socio-politically and culturally marginalized and oppressed.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Descriptive statistical tools including logistic regression and t-test were used to analyze the data which were collected from the semi-structured interview schedule. Out of ten selected good agriculture practices standards, intercropping practices were adopted by the majority of respondents (83%) while the method of irrigation (19%) was found to be the least adopted. The magnitude of logistic regression coefficients of good agriculture practices revealed that occupation was a highly significant (p<0.01) socio-economic variable influencing the adoption of good agriculture practices. Similarly, age, apple cultivated land, economically active population, institutional involvement, and loan for apples was also found significant (p<0.05) for the adoption of different good agriculture practices. From the independent t-test, the productivity of apples was found significantly different between the farmers with and without: recommended nutrient management system, intercropping (p<0.05), recommended pit dimension and irrigation interval (p<0.10). The major problem in apple production were also identified. Based on the findings, increase in apple cultivated land, increase number of apples growing farmers, active role of institution and availability of credit to farmers are suggested to increase the adoption of different GAP in apple.

Long-term comparison (four years) of the plant at Sundhara and the same system comparison of plants at Pokhara and Biratnagar were performed. Long-term analysis of the plant at Sundhara found that the final yield decreased from 2.91 kWh/kWp in 2019 to 2.21 kWh/kWp in 2022.

The idea of Nepal as the asal Hindustan, or “pure land of Hindus” (Stiller 1989, cited under Hindu Monarchy, Polity, and Collapse), was promoted by the political unifier of modern Nepal, Prithvi Narayan Shah, in the eighteenth century but the seeds for this were planted much earlier. Such claims, which persisted well into the modern period, were grounded in the fact that Nepal was geographically and politically isolated, the latter being reinforced by its rulers’ strict policy of isolationism. Nepal thus avoided both Muslim and British rule, which transformed much of the rest of the Indian subcontinent. In contrast, in the oft-quoted words of the French Indologist Sylvain Lévi, Nepal was “India in the making” (Lévi 1905–1908, p. 28, cited under General Overviews). That is, Nepal preserved ancient features of Hindu, Buddhist, and tantric religion that were lost or otherwise transformed elsewhere on the Indian subcontinent. These included animal sacrifice, tantric rituals that abound in the Kathmandu Valley, and the unique syncretism between Hinduism and Buddhism, all of which remain in ample evidence in Nepal today. Historically, Nepal referred only to the Kathmandu Valley and its surrounding environs. This was the domain of the Newars, the indigenous inhabitants of the Valley’s medieval Three Kingdoms (Kathmandu, Lalitpur/Patan, and Bhaktapur). Newars are urban dwellers with their own dual caste system that recognizes a hierarchy for both Newar Hindus and Buddhists, who are not readily categorizable as such because many Newars worship both Hindu and Buddhist deities and participate in a variety of rituals. Newar religion is also strongly influenced by Tantrism and tantric Hindu Śākta (Goddess) elements and practices permeate the Kathmandu Valley, where numerous fierce goddesses figure prominently. In contrast to Newar Hinduism and these tantric influences, there is another form of Hinduism practiced in Nepal known as Parbatiyā Hinduism. Parbatiyā (also known today as Khas-Arya) refers to the Dalit and high-caste Hindus (Brahmins and Kshatriyas, locally known in Nepal as Bahuns and Chetris) who hail from the hills outside of the Kathmandu Valley, often referred to in English nowadays as Hill Hindus. With Gorkha king Prithvi Narayan Shah’s defeat of the Valley in the eighteenth century, Parbatiyā Hindus introduced a more Brahmanical form of Hinduism into Nepal that is derived from and parallels Brahmanical Hindu formations in India. Parbatiyā and Newar forms of Hinduism are neither identical nor entirely distinct. Parbatiyā Hindus and Parbatiyā Hinduism—namely, the ruling elite and their religion, which has been fundamental to legitimating their rule—have hegemonic status in modern Nepal. The declaration of Nepal as a secular republic in 2006 after the collapse of the Hindu monarchy in the aftermath of the Maoist insurgency (1996–2006) affords a new opportunity and lens through which to examine Hinduism in Nepal and its role in Nepali society, culture, and politics moving forward.</p>",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

It begins by tracing the country's rich heritage of challenging and mocking tradition and authority, which has survived political dictatorships, repressive monarchial rule, and natural disasters. It thrives through humor clubs, comedy shows, and festivals; the most prominent and longest-lasting festival is Gaijatra (the Cow Festival), which has lent itself well to cartooning. Indeed, it is remarkable that cartooning has endured, and even made advancements, given the topsy-turvy world of Nepalese government and politics. However, as the chapter shows, cartoonists faced some harrowing situations in the closing years of the millennium, when there were many changes of political administration, a Maoist military movement, and emergency periods. Political cartooning in Nepal overall remains a dismal prospect in contemporary times, however, the chapter reveals a few bright spots for its future.</p>",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

In total 199 households were selected using a stratified random sampling technique. The primary data were collected from January to February 2022. The descriptive statistics, benefit-cost ratio, and binary logistic regression were applied for data analysis using SPSS. The results reveal that the gross margin and benefit-cost ratio of commercial vegetable farming were found to be NRs. 533,130/ha and 3.23 respectively, which were higher than the subsistence vegetable farming (gross margin NRs. 419, 031/ha and benefit to cost ratio 2.49). Further, the findings of binary logistic regression show that age, education of household head, experience, type of family, membership, and access to credit were significantly important determinants of commercial vegetable production. Therefore, any agricultural development programs such as financial services, business training, and encourage farmers to join into cooperatives could be instrumental for commercial vegetable farming.

Stress‐tolerant rice varieties (STRVs) can mitigate this vulnerability, as can having a high seed replacement rate (SRR) and using best management practices (BMPs) in rice cultivation. However, access to high‐quality STRV seed is often limited. This article uses propensity‐score weighted regressions to estimate the spillover effects of seed producer groups (SPGs) in Nepal. It compares adoption rates of STRVs and BMPs, and the SRR of non‐member households in villages with SPGs and in villages adjacent to these compared to other control villages in the region. According to a range of results from weighted models, non‐members in SPG villages and adjacent villages are 24–32 percentage points more likely to have adopted an STRV compared to non‐members in control villages. Non‐members in SPG and adjacent villages have a higher SRR, and households in SPG villages are more likely to use some BMPs compared to non‐members in control villages.

Although breastfeeding is almost universal in Nepal, ranges of regional differences in timely initiation of breastfeeding have been documented. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalance and the determinants of early initiation of breastfeeding among disadvantaged ethnic women in Midwest Nepal. Methods: The data was obtained from a household survey of women who had their last child less than one year of age. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze respondents’ demographic, socioeconomic, obstetric and health services related characteristics. Determinants of timely initiation of breastfeeding were assessed using univariate analysis and further evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis.Results: Of 362 mothers, 65.5% initiated breastfeeding within one hour of childbirth.

Conclusions: Almost two in every three mothers had initiated breastfeeding within one hour of childbirth. The factors influencing timely initiation of breastfeeding were Tharu ethnic mothers, health facility delivery and Ante Natal Care counseling.

However, it has been facing different types of limitations and risks at different levels of the vegetable seeds system in Nepal. Therefore, this paper analyzes overall existing vegetable seeds production environment, its marketing practice and perception of seed producers and users in Nepal. Using simple random sampling technique, a total of 275 seed producers and seed users were selected for the study purpose from four districts. Among them, 175 seed producers were from Rukum and Kavre; 100 seed users were from Rupandehi and Palpa. In addition, 75 seed companies/agro-vets/cooperatives/traders/service providers were selected purposely from all study districts. Indexing techniques, Chi-square test and willingness to pay using direct survey method were used to analyze the data. It was estimated that on average about 10–20% losses were observed in vegetable seeds from farm to wholesale due to poor drying, management and storage practices. The unfavorable environment immediately after harvesting and need to dry several times were ranked as first drying and storage problems, respectively. From the analysis, it was found that selection criteria for hybrid and open-pollinated were found significantly different among fresh vegetable growers. The reasons for choosing hybrids were due to their higher production, attractive fruits and more profit. The study reveals the mismatch between seed production and variety demanded by the fresh growers. Moreover, results on tendency of farmers to change preferred varieties and their willingness to pay additional price for high-quality vegetable seeds indicate the market potential for expansion of quality seed in the future. It seems that the promotion of new post-harvest technologies to maintain dry chain throughout the vegetable seeds system that can provide higher return to the farmers would be easily accepted by the respondents. Therefore, the advantage of microclimatic diversity in hilly areas of Nepal and the seed grower's willingness to maintain good-quality seeds can be utilized to produce huge amount of seeds for the fulfillment of national demand in the plain areas as well as export, especially in SAARC countries.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40066-018-0161-9.pdf,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The author conducted detailed geological studies and mineral exploration in some of the copper and polymetallic prospects and also reviewed the literature related to copper prospects in Nepal. The present research is able to delineate two distinct copper ore mineralization belts extending from west to east and identify the promising sites for copper ore and polymetallic mineralization that could be feasible for mining. The northern mineralization belt lies close to the Main Central Thrust where the mineralization occurs mostly in metamorphic rocks of garnet amphibolite facies in Darchula,Bajhang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Solukhumbu and Ilam districts. The southern mineralization belt in the Lesser Himalaya occurs in low-grade metamorphic rocks of greenschist facies in Dadeldhura, Rukum, Baglung, Myagdi, Tanahun, Dhadhing, Makwanpur, Dolakha, Udaypur, Bhojpur and Ilam districts. Most of these prospects were locally exploited on a small scale by traditional mining before 1951. Almost all mineralization in both belts is related to hydrothermal dissemination, irregular multiple vein type, replacement and cavity fillings and only a few polymetallic mineralizations at the exo-contact zone of granite bodies. The ore minerals were concentrated during the processes of regional metamorphism at the time of Himalayan upheaval. In general, the copper content in the northern belt appears to be higher in grade and tonnage as compared to the southern belt. The frequent association of tungsten, molybdenum, bismuth, nickel, tin, lead, zinc ores and traces of gold suggests the urgent need for further detailed exploration and evaluation of selected prospects which could be economic deposits and feasible for mining.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57919/43295,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Canal lining determines the cost of project to a great extent but also the discharge delivery efficiency of the irrigation system. Though earthen canal sections are least expensive, simple to maintain and environmentally friendly, they have high seepage rates and demand frequent repair. In the light of need for resource conservation and the general unavailability of labour for maintenance work, a canal lining, though more expensive, may be justifiable in the long run. Technological advances in the construction have made available lighter and more affordable materials that enhance many parts of the irrigation process.It is the private sector that should lead the development of these technologies as they relate to the construction business. We can look to foreign markets to see how canal lining technologies have improved the use of this tool in various environments and soils. In the Nepali context, we use traditional lining techniques like stone or reinforced concrete, which are effective in the plains, but less so in the hills and remote. In this paper, I review some alternatives to traditional canal linings, and examine the virtues of high density polyethylene (HDP) pipe for possible use in irrigation schemes. HYDRO Nepal Journal of Water Energy and EnvironmentVolume- 18, 2016, JanuaryPage -25-29",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/14640/11867,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

It is playing a substantial role in food and nutritional security. Rice production is not sufficient to meet domestic consumption, so its import has been increasing. This study aims to explore whether Nepal can be self-sufficient in rice production in the current context of increasing rice demand and changing climate. We assessed the degree to which Nepal can be self-sufficient in rice production by the years 2030, 2040, and 2050, evaluating 12 different scenarios of demand driven by production, population growth, income, and climate change effect. We used compound growth rate estimation for analyzing the growth of rice production and population growth over time. Auto-regressive regression model was used to analyze the relationship of rice import and demand with domestic production, income, and population. A significant (p=0.000) positive impact of income on the import of rice was estimated, whereas significantly (p=0.000) higher impact of production on demand was estimated compared to income. Based on current rice productivity growth of 1.47% and population growth of 1.3% per year over three decades, the country will not achieve self-sufficiency until 2050.The situation would be further worsened in climate change scenarios. However, integrating the population growth rate of the last decade (0.57% per annum) with two productivity growth rate scenarios (current and (ii) 5% annual increment), the country can be self-sufficient by 2040. Based on different scenarios, the estimated demand can be met by increasing current productivity by at least 27–43% by 2030 and 42–85% by 2050. The study identified major gaps and opportunities in the rice production systems of Nepal and provided evidence-based solutions to meet the future demands in the context of increasing population and income, declining land availability, and high vulnerability to climate change.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NARJ/article/download/51926/38916,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The research followed a comprehensive three-step process: firstly, listing and reviewing 54 agricultural policies, and 32 acts of Nepal using a set of thirteen indicators. After that, an assessment of implementation status was done. Then consultation and validation of findings were conducted with the experts in the workshops. The findings contribute to a better understanding of policy implementation and the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices. The study found that while many policies aimed to improve agricultural production and productivity, they lacked actual measures to support increased production, such as assisting with essential inputs like labour, capital, and complementary materials. Additionally, it revealed that approximately 9% of agricultural acts and 54% of policies included provisions for production and management system technologies and innovations. However, no policy provisions for developing production technologies were found for “source seed production” and “to conserve and utilize local resources”.

So the main purpose of our study was to determine the burden of ESBL and MBL production in E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolated from clinical samples. Further, the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of E. coli and K. pneumoniae were also determined. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Om Hospital and Research Centre, Kathmandu, Nepal by using the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolated from different clinical samples (urine, pus, body fluids, sputum, blood) from May 2015 to December 2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase production was detected by combined disc method using ceftazidime and ceftazidime/clavulanic acid discs and cefotaxime and cefotaxime/clavulanic acid discs. Similarly, metallo beta-lactamase production was detected by combined disc assay using imipenem and imipenem/ethylenediaminetetracetate discs. Bacteria showing resistance to at least three different classes of antibiotics were considered multidrug resistant (MDR). Of total 1568 different clinical samples processed, 268 (17.1%) samples were culture positive. Among which, E. coli and K. pneumoniae were isolated from 138 (51.5%) and 39 (14.6%) samples respectively. Of the total isolates 61 (34.5%) were ESBL producers and 7 (4%) isolates were found to be MBL producers. High rates of ESBL production (35.9%) was noted among the clinical isolates from outpatients, however no MBL producing strains were isolated from outpatients. Among 138 E. coli and 39 K. pneumoniae, 73 (52.9%) E. coli and 23 (59%) K. pneumoniae were multidrug resistant. The lowest rates of resistance was seen toward imipenem followed by piperacillin/tazobactam, amikacin and cefoperazone/sulbactam. High rate of ESBL production was found in the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolated from outpatients suggesting the dissemination of ESBL producing isolates in community. This is very serious issue and can't be neglected.

However, pre-basic seed potatoes were produced in Nepal since 1989/90, production of the basic seed has been relatively low, despite the government's lucrative subsidy on the price of pre-basic seed. There have been very limited studies on the production and economics of potato-basic seed under contract farming. This study examines the cost of production, resources use efficiency, return to scale, and various problem associated with the production of basic seed under contract farming in Kavrepalanchok, Nepal. The authors used the Cobb Douglas production function to explore the technological relationship between inputs and outputs. As well as to estimate and analyze the return to scale. They used a scaling technique to construct an index for prioritizing the problems of potato seed production under contract farming as per farmers' perception. The authors found the cost of basic-potato seed production per 500m² areas under contract farming as Rs. 99129.0064. The high cost of production is due to the higher cost of pre-basic seed. They found the gross return from seed production as Rs. 171547.2 per 500m² areas and the Benefit-cost ratio as 1.72. Similarly, they found positive regression coefficients for seed cost and organic manure which is significant at 1% level and negative regression coefficients for human labor which is significant at 5% level. They observed the overutilization of inputs in potato seed production under contracting farming, which was primarily due to the restrictions impeached by the contract agencies on the contract farmers. The authors found that unavailability of pre-basic seed in required quantity as the major problem faced by the farmers of the study area. A comparative study of the seed production with contract and without a contract, may illustrate the better scenario of the study area. Only a few studies have examined the economics of seed production under contract farming in developing countries.

So, this study assessed the profitability and resource utilization of main and spring season rice production. A Semi-structured interview schedule was administered in 2022 among 360 randomly selected main-season rice-producing farmers across three major rice-producing districts of the Terai region of Nepal. Similarly, it conducted four Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) to collect necessary data for spring season rice from two Terai districts within similar agro-ecological regions. Cobb-Douglas production function was used to assess the resource utilization in main season rice production. The result revealed that the total cost and revenue of spring season rice production per hectare was higher, with a benefit-cost ratio of 1.63 compared to the main season. It was found that major resources such as the cost of seed, farm yard manure (FYM), chemical fertilizer, micronutrients, and pesticides were underused. On the other hand, the cost of labor, tillage, and harvesting were found to be overused in the main season of rice production. The proportion of the increase in rice income to the increase in costs of inputs for main season rice production was less, as indicated by the return to scale being less than unity. Hence, the study recommends to focus on addressing on prioritization to increase the cropping area under spring season rice and optimization in the use of resources supported by improved technologies to improve profitability and increase farmers’ income from rice this can eases the constraints in the domestic supply of rice and thereby contribute to lowering the annual volume of rice import.

It is also commonly used as diagnostic test in the assessment or characterization of palpable breast mass along with ultrasonography. The purpose of our study was to assess the mammographic findings in women undergoing screening and diagnostic mammography. Methods: This was a prospective cross sectional study analyzing the outcomes of 497 consecutive screen-film mammographic examinations, 369 (74.2%) diagnostic and 128 (25.8%) screening, performed in female patients from 4th July 2012 to 15th October 2012 in Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital. Analysis was based on the final assessment report of mammogram reviewed by the experienced radiologists following Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification. BI-RADS score 4, 5 and 6 were considered as positive, BI-RADS score 1, 2 and 3 were considered as negative and BI-RADS score 0 was considered inconclusive requiring additional imaging. Results: The mean age of women was 46.3 years (range 26-83 years). Among 369 cases of diagnostic mammograms 300 (81.3%) were negative, 27 (5.4%) were positive and rest 42 (8.4%) were inconclusive. Among 128 cases of screening mammograms, 117 (91.4%) were negative, 11 (8.6%) were inconclusive and none of them were positive. Among total (497) numbers of mammographic examinations, 417 (84%) were negative, 27 (5.4%) were positive and 53 (10.6%) were inconclusive. BI-RADS 1 was the most common reported finding comprising 26.8% in diagnostic and 12.1% in screening group. Conclusion: Analysis of diagnostic mammography examinations yields different results compared with those of screening examinations, including different patient demographics; higher number of positive findings; and possibly higher cancer detection rates. Diagnostic and screening data should be segregated during record keeping and analysis of combined results should be based on known differences between diagnostic and screening outcomes.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/668/618,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Available data were collected from the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MoAD), Department of Agriculture (DoA) and Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC). Green house gas emission (GHG) was estimated by using IPCC 2006 guidelines. Agricultural activities contribute directly to emissions of greenhouse gases through a variety of processes including the source categories such as enteric fermentation in domestic livestock, livestock manure management, rice cultivation, and agricultural soil management. Diverse traditional agriculture systems, unique diversities in land types and unavailability of required disaggregated data at the national level as defined by the emission factor data base (EFDB) of the IPCC 2006, were the problem encountered while calculating the emission status in this study. Annual methane (CH4) emission from paddy fields ranged from 111.57 to 133.07 Gg over years 2000 to 2010 but it was found lowest ( 111.57 Gg) in the year 2002 and highest (133.07 Gg) in the year2003. In the year 2010, methane emission from paddy cultivation represented about 17.48 % of cumulative methane emission both from livestock sector and paddy fields throughout Nepal. Also, some relevant policies and potential strategies towards mitigation measures of methane gas emission from paddy fields for the future in Nepal are highlighted.Agronomy Journal of Nepal (Agron JN), Vol.4, Page: 142-148, 2016",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/15537/12529,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Our results showed that major inputs such as labor, bullock, Farm Yard Manure (FYM) and intercultural operations were overused and need to decrease in terms of cost by 109, 177, 51 and 185%, respectively for its optimum allocation. Similarly, seed was found underused and need to increase its cost by 70% for optimum allocation. We concluded that inadequate training, exposure, knowledge gap and extension service to farmers in study sites were the reasons that farmers were using their resources inefficiently. It is recommended that the farmers involved in potato farming in the surveyed sites should be provided with additional proper technical knowledge for optimizing the use of resources which would help to increase the production and return from potato production.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNARC/article/download/19690/16334,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Maize is the second most important staple crop in Nepal, but the average yield of maize is very low as compared to other countries having similar agro-climatic requirements. Inefficient use of resources had led to low yield in maize crop. The software Raosoft was used to determine the required sample size and total of 182 samples were selected using simple random technique in June, 2016. Stochastic production frontier model and Tobit model were used to derive the results. The average technical efficiency of maize seed production ranged from 0.25-0.92 with an average of 0.71which revealed the scope of increasing technical efficiency by 29 percent. The majority of the farmers (29.1%) were at higher technical efficiency level of 0.8-0.9 followed by 28.6 percent at 0.7-0.8 and 23.1 percent at 0.6-0.7. Age and schooling of household head, experience on maize seed production, area shared by maize crop and dummies variables such as livestock holding, source of seed and access to extension service had found significantly affecting on the technical efficiency level. For the least developed country like Nepal it would be better to use the available resources wisely and improvement of existing technologies would be more cost effective than that of discovering new technologies. The study recommended that the concerned organizations should focus on mixed agricultural farming system, access to better quality seed and provide technical knowledge which would help in improving technical efficiency.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

While Nepal has made significant advances in mitigating under-five mortality, much work is still needed to be done regarding the healthcare of infants. The Nepalese government has identified this as a problem and has introduced a series of interventions to improve the health outcomes of infants. The aim of this review is to identify the goals, interventions, and effectiveness of major infant mortality prevention programs around the country. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. The literature search revealed six programs that Nepal has utilized to combat infant mortality. The Community Based Management of Childhood Illness (CB-IMCI) program utilizes specially trained community workers to help identify and treat children with common childhood illnesses. The National Neonatal Health Strategy (NNHS) links families to the community and then to the broader healthcare system, with success found in its referral system. The Safe Delivery Incentives Program (SDIP) has found success with monetizing safe delivery practices, and shown an increase in safe deliveries with skilled healthcare workers present. Free Newborn Care (FNC) services were aimed at treating sick newborns for free, but ongoing concerns for program sustainability have led to further revision. The Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) is another plan aimed at preventing newborn deaths through improving health system administration and finances, but with limited efficacy data, it is hard to determine its success due to the lack of objective benchmark markers and data collected. Finally, the Birth Preparedness Package (BPP) is a highly efficacious program that encourages communities to plan for pregnancies by planning for delay barriers. Nepal has made significant strides in reducing infant mortality; however, much work still needs to be done. From 1990 to 2020, Nepal has reduced the under-five mortality rate from 138.8 deaths per 1,000 live births to 28.2 deaths per 1,000 live births.",https://www.cureus.com/articles/196847-infant-mortality-screening-and-prevention-initiatives-in-nepal,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

This study investigates the production of biogas from cow dung integrating a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) system to enhance performance of biogas production under low-temperature (15 ± 0.5°C). The biogas production process was assessed using a pilot-scale MEC system optimized at 2.5 V and 1:5 dilution. Performance metrics included biogas yield, methane content, and COD reduction. The MEC integration significantly improved biogas production, with a 20-fold increase at 2.5 V compared to the control reactor at 15°C. Scaling up to an 8.5 L pilot system demonstrated a fourfold increase in biogas production. Optimal conditions of 2.5 V and 1:5 dilution resulted in an 84.21% COD reduction at 15°C, increasing to 88.28% at the pilot scale. Molecular identification of microbial consortia isolated from biogas production medium were specifically Bacillus cereus, Bacillus paramycoides, Bacillus licheniformis and Priestia flexa which play crucial role in organic matter degradation and electron transfer in MEC operation at low temperature.

This chapter examines whether women and men manage household waste differently at the household level, especially at source segregation, managing recyclable waste (paper and plastic), and composting degradable waste. Using household survey data from the Bharatpur Metropolitan City of Nepal, we find that women are more likely to segregate waste at the source and also manage degradable waste at home better. Still, there is no gender difference in selling plastic and paper waste. In contrast, women are more likely to give paper or plastic waste either to the waste collectors (free) or throw away, suggesting a heterogeneity across gender when it comes to managing household waste. In most cases, women waste managers perform well (segregating at source and composting degradable waste), but they do not seem to do well in all areas of plastic or paper waste management where some sort of sensitization may be helpful.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The government and household members of the country of origin have been taking the maximum possible advantages of remittances in various fields, and it is becoming a more stable source of external finance. However, around 80 percent of remittance received by households is used only for consumption purposes in Nepal. Despite the increasing importance of remittance in the Nepalese economy, the relationship between remittance and private consumption has not yet been adequately studied. Hence, the prime objective of this paper is to analyze the effects of remittance on private consumption expenditure in Nepal. The ARDL bounds testing model is employed in the study to identify the effects of remittance on private consumption in Nepal. The time series data for 20 years, 2001-2020, are collected from various government sources, such as the Ministry of Finance, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), and the National Statistics Office. This study finds a positive and significant relationship between remittances and private consumption in Nepal. The impact of other control variables like GDP is positive and significant for consumption. However, the consumer price index has a negative effect on consumption.

Further, these chemicals in agriculture have resulted adverse effect on ecology, environmental contamination, accumulation of these toxic compounds in soil. These have led a demand for technologies of improving both the quantity and quality of agricultural products. To meet the demand of the growing population, the productivity need to be increased significantly. There are very limited industries in Nepal producing biopesticides, microbial biofertilizers that can be used for increased agricultural production. Biofertilizers, biopesticides, and biocontrol agents are the alternatives to chemical agents. Microorganisms applied to soil or plant improve the productivity. These microorganisms are natural and widely used to control pests and protect human health. Microbial inoculants such as bacteria, fungi, virus and algae which are environment-friendly and can be used in sustainable manner.

It is an extremely prioritized sector for uplifting livelihood of rural people. Due to an increase in the area under vegetable production for both the main and offseason, and replacement of locally produced seeds by the improved varieties, there is an increase in the vegetable seed demand. Nevertheless, only 50% of the national demand for vegetable seeds was met by domestic production. Western Rukum has long been known as the area with the most potential for vegetable seed production in Nepal. In this regard, this study was executed to assess the cost, return, and profitability of major vegetable seed production in the district. Altogether 201 sample households were selected using simple random sampling in 2017. The primary data were collected from household survey using a pre-tested semi-structured survey schedule and verified from a focus group discussion. The study showed that 13 types of vegetable seeds had been producing in the study area. Among them, onion seed, cauliflower seed, radish seed, and pea seed were primarily grown. The research revealed that all the major four vegetable seeds were profitable subsectors, where, cauliflower was the most profitable vegetable seed crop with B:C 1.78, followed closely by onion seed (1.68), radish seed (1.52), and pea seed (1.27). In contrast, the onion seed had the highest gross margin (NPR.121,682) per ha followed closely by cauliflower seed (NPR.117,136), radish seed (NPR.47,640), and pea seed (NPR.27,131).

Crustal thickening led to partial melting and formation of leucogranite melts along the top of the GHS, from earlier muscovite dehydration to later biotite dehydration melting with time. The granite was not a diapiric intrusion and does not intrude across the STD low-angle normal fault. A low-angle, north-dipping normal fault, the ductile-brittle Nar-Phu detachment wraps around the top of the Manaslu leucogranite and truncates all leucogranites in the footwall. The detachment formed the roof fault during exhumation of footwall rocks (channel flow) along the upper GHS during the early-middle Miocene. Metamorphism is also entirely regional and not contact metamorphism. U-Th/Pb monazite ages from metapelites show semi-continuous metamorphism across the GHS from ~35-15 Ma. The leucogranites were emplaced as layer-parallel sills entirely within the GHS between ~25-18.5 Ma. U-Th/Pb monazite dates from the Manaslu leucogranites suggest two major intrusion phases at 22.5 Ma (Larke-la phase) and 19.5 Ma (Bimtang phase). The sheeted sill complex was emplaced by progressive underplating with the oldest intrusions structurally above the younger ones. The migmatite melt source was likely buried further to the north. GHS rocks structurally beneath the Manaslu granite show few leucogranite dykes.

Niche specific commodities that have comparative advantage could be produced in fair quantity to meet the demand of huge market of neighboring India and China as purchasing capacity of people in those countries has improved markedly mainly for quality agriculture commodities. Trade deficit, food insecurity, income generation, poverty reduction, and employment generation could be addressed by turning present status of subsistence agriculture into robust, vibrant and commercial agriculture through technology led agro-industrialization. There are agro-commodities which are imported from India and other countries in huge quantity by the scarce hard currency earned through remittance. Evidence shows that almost 70% of the remittance is spent for agriculture commodities which have high potentiality to produce within the country even after local consumption. Such produce could be exported to other countries to mitigate trade imbalance, enhance export promotion and import reduction and promote graduating Nepal from LDC to DC within the stipulated time frame as proposed a couple of years ago by the government of Nepal. Nepal should come up with functional, pragmatic and implementable agriculture plan and policy to harness huge possibility of agriculture commercialization to meet the consumption demand per se within and outside the country.

A total of 20 key informant interviews (KII) were also conducted to understand the perception of farm households on commercial vegetable farming. The result shows that around 94% of the total sampled farm households have leasehold farmland that has spread to different settlements of Kirtipur Municipality. Out of total leasehold farmers, 69% have written agreement with the landowner. The result also shows that the farmers cultivate vegetables in an average area of 5.67 ropani (2884.49m2). Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) are the primary vegetable products, whereas cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) and other green leafy vegetables are mostly cultivated as secondary vegetable products. Dug wells are the major sources of irrigation on vegetable farmland.

It has a high prevalence in the population and is associated with high morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Here, we aimed to study the socio-demographic profiles, etiologies of CKD and associated co-morbidities in patients attending a referral hospital. Methods: We conducted a hospital based, descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study among adult patients with CKD attending Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH), Kathmandu. Patients younger than 16 years and renal allograft recipients were excluded from the study. A diagnosis of CKD was established by the treating nephrologist based on KDIGO 2012 clinical practice guideline. Prior informed consent was taken. Data was collected on clinical features, socio-demographic profiles, major co-morbidities, presumed etiology of CKD and hematological and biochemical parameters of the patients. SPSS version 24 (Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the analysis of data. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Institute of Medicine (IOM). Results: A total of 401 patients with CKD were included in the study. The mean age of the patient was 50.92 years (SD=17.98), male to female ratio was 1.8:1. Among these patients, 86% were Hindu, 24.4% were farmers, 57% were from the Hilly region of Nepal, 51% were active smokers, and 51.6% were alcohol consumers. Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) (36.2%; n= 145), diabetes mellitus (31.9%; n= 128) and hypertension (21.7%; n=87) were the three most common identified causes of CKD. Among the biopsy proven CGN patients, IgA nephropathy was the most common cause. In a large proportion of patients (68.3%) cause of CGN was not known. Most of the patients were in CKD stage 5 (27%), and stage 5D (55.8%). Coronary artery disease (CAD) (in 7% patients), heart failure (in 2.7%) and stroke (in 2.2%) were the most common comorbidities. Anemia was prevalent in CKD from stage 3 onwards, the severity increased with increasing stage (p <0.001). Hemodialysis was the predominant mode of renal replacement therapy (RRT) used by 98.2% of CKD 5D patients. Conclusion: Nepalese patients of CKD are younger; males are more affected than females. CGN, diabetes and hypertension are three most common causes of CKD; IgA nephropathy is the most common cause of biopsy proven CGN leading to CKD. Anemia is common from CKD stage 3 onwards. The most common associated co-morbidity is CAD.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/879/788,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The government has been spending a significant portion of its budget on imports, and it aims to reduce this dependence by increasing domestic production and achieving food security goals. To understand the dynamics of this issue, system dynamics modelling steps were employed. The key variables considered in the model testing were domestic production, imports, per capita consumption, productivity per hectare, and average area expansion rate. The study utilized time series data from 1991 to 2020 and projected the analysis up to 2050 using Stella Architect, a computer-based software program. The findings reveal that both the population and imports have exhibited exponential growth over the years. The model also indicates goal-seeking behaviour, with the government setting targets for yield increment based on available harvest areas. However, the policies implemented thus far have mostly been quick-fix approaches focusing input subsidized programs. According to the model, an increase of 70-100% in rice production will be required by 2050 to meet the growing population's demand. The study presents three policy options for achieving rice self-sufficiency: 1) a 2% annual increase in average area expansion, 2) raising productivity from 3700 kg ha-1 to 5000 kg ha-1 and 3) increasing productivity to 3900 kg ha-1 while reducing per capita rice consumption from 200 kg to 130 kg. The study suggests that adopting the recommended policy implications can help increase rice production in Nepal. Decision-makers should adopt a dynamic approach to the rice production system to address the issue of slow growth and achieve national self-sufficiency and food security goals.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/62168/46954,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Natural shocks can disrupt the utilization of relatively cleaner energy sources like biogas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). This study examines the impact of natural shocks on the adoption and usage of clean cooking fuels focusing on LPG. Using data from the third wave of the Household Risk and Vulnerability Survey 2018, logistic regression is employed to analyze both the likelihood of LPG adoption and household expenditure on LPG under conditions of natural shocks. The findings reveal that households experiencing natural shocks are 5 percent less on average likely to adopt biogas or LPG. Furthermore, household expenditure on LPG decreases by 4.43 percent relative to cooking fuel expenses particularly for firewood by the households experiencing natural shocks. This reduction highlights a decline in the intensity of clean energy use among households concurrently using LPG and firewood. These results underscore the negative effects of natural shocks on the transition to clean cooking fuels posing challenges to achieving sustainable adoption of clean energy solutions.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/73397/56676,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

A feasible generalized least square technique is employed to calculate the vulnerability score, further disaggregated between rural-urban areas, provinces, and major caste/ethnic groups. The findings reveal that thirty-two percent of households are highly vulnerable, indicating that they have higher chances of falling below the poverty line due to death, illness, unemployment, and other household-specific shocks. The paper also finds that Karnali and Sudur Paschim Provinces have higher vulnerability than other provinces. Likewise, Dalits and Muslims have higher vulnerability scores compared to other castes / ethnic groups. The estimation suggests that the poverty incidence and vulnerability scores largely overlap, yet the vulnerability scores are consistently higher among all groups indicating a high risk of households falling into poverty. Therefore, it is desirable that major groups’ vulnerability profile, in addition to poverty profile, should be constructed and aligns the pro-poor policies to the vulnerable groups to mitigate the risks of pushing such vulnerable households below the poverty line.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/48035/35995,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing an estimate for quarterly GDP for the period of 1997/98 Q1 to 2017/18 Q4 following well established Chow-Lin procedure. The quarterly exports and government tax revenue are used to extrapolate the magnitude and movement of quarterly GDP. The results show a deterministic seasonal movement over the quarters. In particular, increased economic activities are observed in the second and fourth quarters while making a comparison on quarter to quarter basis. It is expected that this paper will partially fulfill the gap of unavailability of quarterly GDP figures in the public domain, and documents that the researcher may use suitable econometric exercise to obtain inter-temporal disaggregation of low-frequency data such as annual GDP into quarterly figures.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/36036/28143,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Forensic experts handle a very small part of total medico-legal work as most of them work in private medical colleges which are not permitted to handle the work. Mortuaries are housed in outdated facilities. Exposure to the medical students on medico legal cases including autopsy is done only on a sporadic basis taking them to nearby government hospitals and even if they visit the hospitals, inadequate infrastructure prevents better learning.

It may include the use of threat or force. In some cases, the person cannot give consent to sex because he/she is unconscious or otherwise incapacitated. A person may be raped by a stranger, an acquaintance or date or a family member.Methods: The study was a retrospective and descriptive analysis of cases of sexual assault victims examined by the author in the Forensic Medicine departments at Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj and Gandaki Medical College Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal over a period of four years (2012 to 2016). This includes information regarding the age group of the victim at the time of sexual abuse, relationship of the victim to the perpetrator, genital and extra-genital injuries present over the victim’s body and number of cases attended as an expert witness by the author in various courts of Nepal.Results: In the four years period, a total number of 55 cases were examined as sexual assault cases. It was observed that majority were of the 13 - 15 years of age group (46%) followed by <10 years (20%), 16 - 20 years (16%), >20 years (11%) and 10 - 12 years (7%). Regarding the relationship of the victim to the alleged perpetrator, 87% cases (48 out of 55) were related to acquaintances compared to 13% due to strangers. Surprisingly, 3.6% cases (2 out of 48) were due to the biological fathers of the victims. On physical examination of the victim’s body, 36% cases showed genital injuries compared to only 15% with extra genital injuries. The author attended the court as an expert witness in 33% of these cases. Only 7% of the cases were mentally challenged.Conclusion: Young adults remain the most vulnerable group, so education related to sex, morality, humanity and different life skills training should be provided to these groups from their school years itself. The benefits of early intervention and comprehensive care of survivors with the use of standardized protocols along with shorter and lesser traumatic period of court processing to the survivors of these cases should be encouraged.Journal of Gandaki Medical College Volume, 09, Number 2, July December  2016, Page: 43-46",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/17865/14496,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Empirically, we present a fine‐grained analysis of the upstream section of the global production network for commercial medicinal plants harvested in and traded from Nepal. In particular, the paper investigates the within‐group and between‐group dynamics of key actors (traders and wholesalers). Empirical data was generated through 257 quantitative and 121 qualitative interviews with harvesters, sub‐local traders, local traders, central wholesalers and regional wholesalers, supplemented with focus‐group discussions. Analysis focuses on three key areas of interaction: infrastructural and ecological variations; territorial embeddedness and development; and institutional power and network reconfiguration.

Lockdown is considered to be an effective measure in slowing the spread of coronavirus. The study expects to understand community and healthcare providers’ perspectives on COVID-19 and pandemic responses during and after the lockdown in Nepal. Methods and material: Data were collected through telephone interviews with six representatives of community-based organizations and nine healthcare providers, and the collation of information about COVID-19 from social media, news outlets and government announcements. Data were thematically coded and analyzed according to the themes. Results: Although rapid dissemination of educational information through various social media was found, people reported an information overload on COVID-19 while questioning the authenticity of their sources. Several misbeliefs on the COVID-19 virus are rooted in the Nepalese community. Lockdown for a longer period was deemed an unsustainable preventive measure that directly impacted the income source of daily-wage workers. The fear of contracting coronavirus among healthcare providers at their workplaces was further triggered by the poor working conditions and non-availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). In fighting the pandemic, screening and management of other health issues were ignored. Conclusion: The prevention measures against COVID-19 are important for the local context, however, the communities need access of basic commodities and access to reliable information to enable them to follow these measures. Availability of appropriate PPE for the healthcare providers is required to reduce the fear of contracting the virus from the patients and workplace.

They play a vital role in daily life purposes to big engineering constructions such as dams, reservoirs or hydropower projects. It is mandatory to understand the morphology and dynamics of the river before initiating any projects for easier planning and to prevent possible damage to structures. The Malekhu Khola area is one of the potential areas for urbanization and has already been undergoing development of settlement and other infrastructures. This paper describes the morphology and dynamics of the Malekhu Khola to classify and characterize the river's behavior and competency. The Malekhu Khola is a sixth-order river having its total length of 24.83 km, watershed area of 101.28 km2 and the average gradient of 0.041 m/m. Various morphological parameters were measured with the aid of topographic maps, aerial photographs and Geographic Information System (GIS). The hydraulic parameters, channel sediment and slopes were measured at 10 different transects sites through field surveys. The river was classified using the Rosgen's Level II criteria. The river reaches have been classified as A4-, B4- and C4-type streams. A4- and B4-type streams are moderate-gradient gravelly and low sinuosity rivers whereas C4-type streams are low-gradient gravelly meandering river. The Malekhu Khola gradually changes from A4- to B4-type streams up to 12 km downstream, and then to C4-type stream further downstream, but B4-type streams reappear within the distance of 15 km to 19 km from the origin. This study presents temporal changes in river channel, and flow competence and aggrading/degrading potential evaluation of the Malekhu Khola.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/22873/19438,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Although government has been investing in cereal production since 1960s and there is a slow and steady growth in area, production and yield. In this scenario, there is dearth of research studies which provides overview of the growth and instability of the cereal crops, and it is also necessary to identify the causes of the growth in production. This paper tries to address the fore mentioned issue by measuring the growth rate and instability in area, production and yield of paddy, wheat and maize in Nepal for 30 years ranging from 1990/91 to 2019/20. Similarly, it also attempts to identify the cause of growth crops by using decomposition method.  It is found that there was significant growth in area of paddy only in period I; and in production and yield in period II and overall time period. In wheat and maize, it is found that there is statistically significant increase in the area, production and yield in all the sub periods and over all time periods, except for area in wheat in period III. Similarly, it is found that in all the crops studied, greater extent of instability was observed in production, followed by the yield. And, in all the crops, area effect is higher than yield and interaction effect in all the time periods and whole study time frame. Int. J. Soc. Sc. Manage.

Attitude can be formed from a person’s past and present. This profession continues to grow and the attitude of the society toward it has been changing gradually. There have been a few studies on the attitude of the nurses toward their own profession in Nepal. The primary objective of this study is to compare the attitude of the nursing students and the practicing nurses toward nursing profession. Methods: A quantitative, prospective comparative cross sectional study design was adapted for this study. Nursing students studying proficiency certificate level (PCL)in a Nursing campus, and the practicing nurses working at a Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) in Kathmandu, Nepal were selected as study population. Attitude scale for nursing profession (ASNP) developed by Ipek- Coban and Kasikci in 2011 was adapted for the purpose of this study. Results: A total of 240 participants were selected for the study. One hundred and twenty were nursing students and 120 were practicing nurses. Only 0.8% of nursing students had negative attitude and all practicing nurses had positive attitude toward nursing profession. The t test {t(238)=-2.868, p=0.005} value of the comparative study denoted the attitude of the students and practicing nurses was different statistically. Conclusion: Contrary to previous beliefs, there is a strong positive attitude on nursing profession among both nursing students and practicing nurses, the attitude of the later reaching 100%. This should be considered by health care planner in formulating national policy to take a major step toward creating more scope for trained nurses which will in turn reduce brain drain.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/864/773,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The household survey was carried out in Kailash (hill) and Nayabasti (terai) of Chitwan. Descriptive analysis, mean comparison, correlations, and biodiversity indices were used for data analysis. On the basis of biodiversity index, evenness, the adequate number of species, and Sorenson’s coefficient, open-pollinated (OP) (nonhybrid) vegetables were more diverse in hills than in terai, while hybrid vegetables are more diverse in terai than in hills. Hybrid vegetables were mostly grown in terai, where the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides was also higher. OP vegetables dominated hilly areas. Gurung ethnic community had a significant role in the conservation of indigenous vegetable biodiversity. The primary source of seed was home storage in the case of OP vegetables in hills. However, in terai, agro-concerns were used as a significant source of seeds, followed by co-operatives. Co-operatives’ involvement was high in terai as compared to hills, but the role was not significant in vegetable farming. In contrast, assistance in vegetable farming from agriculture service provider organizations was higher in hills as compared to terai. The major problem in vegetable farming was lack of irrigation in both areas, followed by market inaccessibility in hills, whereas climate change was rising as a problem in terai. Markets of produced goods were farm gate, local markets, and distant markets. A middleman mostly did the price determination of the products. Off-season vegetable farming was not practiced in the study areas. However, off-farm vegetable production was typical in hilly areas. Indigenous and OP vegetable biodiversity has been facing various challenges despite their roles in nutrition, indigenous knowledge promotion, and food security. Hence, it is suggested to strengthen government policy toward irrigation facility development, gene bank establishment, marketing facilities, and technology transfer and develop on-farm community based intense organizations for sustainable vegetable diversity conservation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/29731/23899,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The data were obtained by the interview of 66 purposively selected producers (33 each of maize grain and seed producers) with the use of pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. Both the grain and seed producers were similar in terms of socio-demographic characteristics and marketing accessibilities, but the seed producers were significantly benefited from the trainings, extension services, and credit facilities despite having comparatively small size of land holding (0.14 ha) than the grain producers. The inputs (manures, fertilizers, and the seed) contributed 48% and 50% of the total cost incurred for grain and seed production, respectively whereas the pre-sowing and sowing activities contributed more than 77% of cost in both the cases. In spite of higher cost for seed production, the benefit cost ratio of seed production was higher (1.52) than grain production (1.13). Findings also revealed that only 24% of the total harvest was processed and marketed as seed whereas using optimum quantity (66% middle portion of the cob) for seed production could further increase the income by 23.35%.

The factor classes having greater influence for higher landslide hazard are: near the streams, near the roads, barren or grassland, land with phyllite bedrocks, land receiving rainfalls greater than 4,000 mm, lands with an elevation range from 1,000 m to 1,500 m, slopes steeper than 30°, and south-facing slope.

This review paper describes the recent climate change pattern and phenomenon with its impact on fruit production in Nepal. Various researches suggest that change in temperature has played vital to reduce the level of soil organic carbon, and soil micronutrients. With exposure to extreme temperatures, insects may produce heat shock proteins, cryoprotectants and osmolyte compounds within their bodies to survive, so these insects can exist in such environment. Most of the researches resulted that higher temperature induces early flowering under the subtropics may result in low fruit-set because of abnormalities arising from prevailing low night temperatures. Similarly, insufficient chilling greatly influences flower initiation and fruit coloration along with deterioration in fruit texture and taste. Besides the effect of high and low temperature, papers also claimed that decline in rainfall from November to April adversely affects the winter and spring crops that ultimately reduces food production. Hence, organization related to fruit research, education and development in Nepal have to run effective program to bring new genetic sources that can resist the adverse effect of climate and may bring some positive vibe to tackle the climate change.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Bringing the time series trade data from reliable sources, this study also attempts to highlight import dependency ratio, correlation of population and GDP per capita growth with total import and pin down plausible reasons behind these pictures. The correlation study between import data to population growth and GDP per capita showed a positive correlation with r values 0.71 (p<0.05) and 0.99 (p<0.05), respectively. National supply sides when combine with domestic production mimics aggregate rice demands and these figures show increasing patterns accompanied by growing imports together with import dependency ratio. India alone dominates the rice trade which accounts for more than 90 percent of Nepal’s import in recent years. These noticeable surges in rice imports can be attributed to liberal trade policies of the respective trade partner countries, improvement in incomes, closer proximity, similar languages, and consumer preferences among others. Opening a domestic market for rice cannot be denied theoretically in favor of welfare-improving policy tools, however, it should be carefully considered to protect local farmer’s concerns. Though growth in rice productivity is encouraging over the recent previous years, there is ample potential to increase further by integrated programs combining expansion of spring paddy, inputs, irrigation, and technology. Moreover, attention should be paid toward consumer’s fine rice preferences aligning farmer’s motivations. The introduction of fiscal policy with application of tariff or non-tariff measures at least for a few years can encourage the domestic rice industry. Above policy adjustment can drive Nepal toward its rice self-reliant footing.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44796/33691,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

However, mainstreaming climate change issues into sectoral policies from the government can be seen as recent activities in Nepal. Nepal has contributed negligible amount of emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) of global greenhouse gas, it is the fourth most vulnerable country in the world. In this context, this paper aims to review climate change adaptation policies in terms of sectoral integration. This paper has adopted text-mining method for information retrieval and knowledge mining and followed step-by-step approach to undertake review of policies. It concludes that National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010 can be a milestone in sectoral adaptation of climate change issue largely because it has provided the national framework for sectoral adaptation to climate change. However, NAPA ignores the importance of structural and institutional reforms needed for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into sectoral agencies.

This paper concludes that newly endorsed Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act (2017) can be a milestone in disaster management of Nepal not only because it has replaced about 40 years old Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 but also for the first time, it saw disaster risk management as an process focusing on different stages of disaster management cycles, preparedness, response and rehabilitation and mitigation. The provision of well-structured functional institutional set-up from the centre to local level can have positive outcome in disaster management. However, it overlooks significant aspect, such as the declaration of disaster-prone zones limiting the right of provincial disaster management committee only for recommendation to the Government of Nepal. Most of policies, strategies and legislations focused on some specific disasters such as flood, landslide, earthquake and GLOF/avalanches at national level paying less emphasis to the local level. Even now, most of the policy interventions towards different cycles of disaster risk management have laid emphasis on preparedness and response rather than to rehabilitation and mitigation. The conflicting provisions in Acts such as Water Resource Act (1992) and Building Act (1998) with Local Government Operation Act (2017) have made overlapping of their roles and responsibilities. So, the policy formulation and institutional set-up needs to be complemented by the ability and competence to operationalize the intent of the relevant acts and policies at all levels of government.The Geographical Journal of NepalVol. 11: 1-24, 2018 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/19546/16004,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

However, local producers of essential medicines must comply with international pharmaceutical standards in order to be eligible to compete in donor tenders. These standards determine production rights for on-patent and off-patent medicines, and guide international procurement of medicines. We reviewed the literature on the impact of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) on local production; a gap analysis from the literature review indicated a need for further research. Over sixty interviews were conducted with people involved in the Nepali pharmaceutical production and distribution chain from 2006 to 2009 on the GMP areas of relevance: regulatory capacity, staffing, funding and training, resourcing of GMP, inspectors’ interpretation of the rules and compliance. Although Nepal producers have increased their overall share of the domestic market, only the public manufacturer, Royal Drugs, focuses on medicines for public health programmes; private producers engage mainly in brand competition for private markets, not essential medicines. Nepali regulators and producers state that implementation of GMP standards is hindered by low regulatory capacity, insufficient training of staff in the industry, financial constraints and lack of investment for upgrading capital. The transition period to mandatory compliance with WHO GMP rules is lengthy. Less than half of private producers had WHO GMP in 2013. Producers are not directly affected by international harmonisation of standards as they do not export medicines and the Nepali regulator does not enforce the WHO standards strictly. Without an international GMP certificate they cannot tender for donor dependent health programmes. In Nepal, local private manufacturers focus mainly on brand competition for private consumption not essential medicines, the government preferentially procures essential medicines from the only public producer while donor funded programmes rely on international manufacturers compliant with international GMP standards. We also found evidence of private hospitals bypassing national medicines approvals process.

Despite recognition of adaption in response to multiple changes in sustainable livelihood and critical climate change literature, risks attributed to biophysical effects of climate change have increasingly assumed importance. Consequently, diversification is promoted as an adaptive approach to reduce such risks. However, understanding livelihood adaptation from the vantage point of climate change alone might lead to a limited understanding of non-climatic factors also shaping it. This paper proposes understanding adaptation through analysing long-term livelihood changes and using society rather than climate change as a conceptual starting point. It argues that such an approach has better potential to highlight a broader range of dynamic drivers operating over decades and to inform contextually grounded rural livelihood adaptation policies. Changes are traced in the overall livelihood trajectories among four rural communities in Nepal, in living memory, to understand the role of adaptation in shaping it. Qualitative life narratives were collected and complemented by key informant interviews, field observations and the analysis of official documents. The findings suggest that livelihoods have shifted not only from subsistence towards income generation but also from engagement in diverse livelihood sectors towards specialisation; the opposite of the advocated diversification.

With changes in demographical, socio-economic, and environmental status, the livestock sector in the developing world is facing challenges of low productivity and has become both a culprit and a victim of undesirable climate change impacts globally. In this paper, we will review the status of Nepalese livestock production systems and evaluate possible livestock species-specific strategies to promote a more productive and sustainable livestock sector in the future. In Nepal, the livestock sector is deemed essential to alleviate poverty and improve the nutritional status of the population, as in many other developing countries. However, there is a need for substantial improvements in livestock productivity, in particular improvement of feeding strategies to exploit the genetic potential of livestock. For ruminants, the important issue is to improve nutritional value and hence utilization of existing feedstuffs. Use of, e.g., urea, molasses, and enzymes to improve feed digestibility and implementation of technologies to effectively preserve biomass from forages that are only seasonally available are necessary strategic measures. Identification and use of novel anti-methanogenic feed ingredients will be crucial to develop a ruminant livestock sector that is not only productive, but also environmentally sustainable. For monogastric animals, the development and use of novel protein feed ingredients, such as insects raised on indigestible (for monogastrics) plant residues, should become part of future feeding strategies in support of a circular bioeconomy and improved productivity, not least in small scale poultry production. Future policies should also include a strong focus on capacity building and development of research infrastructure, and promotion of collaborative activities among research and industry sectors to establish a productive yet sustainable livestock sector in Nepal.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/12/5/679/pdf,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Despite having increasing interest in Coagulase Negative Staphylococci, few studies from Nepal have reported the association of these organisms with urinary tract infections, conjunctivitis, high vaginal swabs, and cerebrospinal fluid. This study was carried out to determine antibiotic susceptibility pattern and biofilm production among Coagulase Negative Staphylococci isolated from clinical samples at tertiary care hospital.Methods: This study was a hospital based cross-sectional study in which 3690 clinical samples were included. Isolation and identification of isolates was done following standard microbiological protocol. Coagulase Negative Staphylococci were identified phenotypically on the basis of gram staining, slide and tube coagulase test and by various sugar fermentation tests. Antibiotic susceptibility test was done following Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2020). Biofilm production was determined by Tissue Culture Plate technique. Results: A total of 113 isolates of Coagulase Negative Staphylococci were detected. Among them S. epidermidis (45.1%), S. saprophyticus (23.9%), S. haemolyticus (16.8%), S. hominis (5.3%), S. capitis (2.7%), ­­­­­S. cohini (1.8%), S. lugdunensis (1.8%) and S. sciuri (2.7%) were identified phenotypically.

In Nepal, the southern part of the country comprises Quaternary deposits called as Indo-Gangetic deposit. Sand and silts are dominant in this zone, where groundwater level is also relatively high. In eastern Nepal, several places have experienced ground fissures, sand boiling, and liquefaction during the large earthquakes in the past history. There are several factors including soil properties, groundwater level, grain size of sediments and ground acceleration that contribute to ground liquefaction. The eastern Nepal faced a devastating earthquake in 1934 (magnitude of 8.4), Udaypur earthquake in 1988 (magnitude of 6.6) and Sikkim-Nepal earthquake in 2011 (magnitude of 6.8) and there is still possibility of similar large earthquakes in future. Liquefaction was reported in many places during Nepal-Bihar earthquake that indicates possibility of liquefaction during similar earthquakes. Liquefaction potential values are calculated from sediment grain size, subsurface geology, groundwater level and standard penetration test (SPT)-N values. The epicenter, magnitude, and other parameters of Nepal-Bihar earthquake have been used to calculate the liquefaction potential. A liquefaction susceptibility map has been prepared in the study area that comprises low, medium, and high liquefaction potential zones.

At present the estimated contract duration lacks uniformity among the projects of similar size and nature. With time extension issue getting much attention in recent amendments of PPR, estimation of duration has yet in the shadows among the lawmakers. This research aims at developing an empirical formulae for determination of contract duration based on the historical data of roads and bridges completed within the last five years. A total of 83 bridges and 78 road projects were analyzed. Regression analysis was carried out for developing a mathematical relation between time and cost of the project. The data was made to fit in Browmillow’s time-cost model. Apart from the cost of the project, there are other factors that affect the duration of the project. To address these project specific requirements, modification were recommended to the time-cost model by introducing coefficients in the empirical relation. As per the obtained equation, contract duration is directly proportional to the cost. However, the rate of increase in contract duration decreases with increase in cost. The reason for this is due to the higher level of parallel activities and better use of technologies for the contracts with higher cost. This model can be useful for government agencies, contractors and consultants involved in construction and procurement of roads and bridges in Nepal.

Agricultural agencies and farmers ignored these cereals while giving precedence over rice, wheat, and other crops such as oilseeds and pulses. Millets can foster well in poor soil conditions with less water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The main objectives of the study were to assess prospects and potentiality of millet, constraints during farming, and the possible strategies to overcome problems by analyzing the data and secondary literature. Districts in the eastern part of Nepal show dominance in millet production. Millet contains a comparative advantage over other cereals in terms of soil climatic adaptability, drought resistance, insect pest tolerance, and management factors. Further, the health-promoting factors play an important role in tackling food security and malnutrition problems, particularly in mid and high hills. The preference of tourists towards ""dhido"" has further increased its demand at present. However, lack of domain-specific high-yielding varieties, high preference towards major cereals, and poor marketing infrastructure particularly in marginal areas are the constraints mainly considered for unexpected production of millet. Millet features a high possibility of improving the production which can be supported with subsidy, improving tourism, promoting the millet products with agro-based industries, and motivating the growing farmers.

They were confirmed by using Czapeck yeast extract agar (CYA). Fermentation was carried out for ochratoxin production at different moisture levels: 20%, 40% and 60% by using coffee as a substrate. The extract was assayed for the presence of ochratoxin by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Results showed that high production of this toxin (402 ppb) was obtained in coffee containing 60% of moisture after 19 days of incubation period with high load of fungal growth and the effect of roasting on coffee containing ochratoxin was observed where the level of it was decreased after roasting.

Thus, this paper has explored the cause and characteristics of landslides occurrences and their mitigation practices in Nepal. Topographic, geologic and triggering factors, and human intervention causing landslides are characterised to suggest the suitable mitigation options that can be implemented in the mountain hill-slopes. Among the wide range of slope stabilisation measures which are available to practitioner engineer, the lowering of groundwater level in combination of controlling of surface infiltration (e.g. sealing of tension cracks) of water into landslide are the most cost effective options for mountainous terrain because the rise in pore water pressure is one of the basic cause of landslides during the rainy season. In addition, removing of unstable slope debris, surface drainage, and retaining walls are the useful landslide mitigation measures depending on site conditions, availability of budget, and specific requirements.

District hospitals are in frontline to manage chronic disorders including thyroid. Primary care workforce of physicians and mid-level providers together deliver care in these hospitals. Few hospitals are equipped with tests to diagnose thyroid disorders. The objective of the study is to find the burden of thyroid disorder in a district hospital of Nepal.Methods: This was a descriptive cross sectional study conducted in Bayalpata Hospital. One year data from July 2017 to June 2018 was collected from the electronic health record system. Data was collected from 999 patients through convenient sampling where thyroid function test was done. Subgroup analysis was done on basis of gender, symptoms at presentation and comorbidities.Results: Prevalence of thyroid disorder in a district hospital of Nepal was 171 (17.11%) at 95% confidence interval, range occurring from 14% to 20%. Among them, 130 (76%) had hypothyroidism and 41 (24%) had hyperthyroidism. Prevalence of thyroid disorder among female was 147 (14.7%) and among male was 24 (2.4%). The most common symptom was depressed mood followed by nonspecific pain disorder, thyroid swelling, paresthesia and menstrual disturbances and common comorbidities reported were depression, diabetes, hypertension, anxiety disorder and chronic gastritis. Conclusions: Our study showed the burden of thyroid disorders in a primary care district hospital with hypothyroidism being more common than hyperthyroidism. Thyroid disorder must be addressed on time to lower the burden. However, most of the rural population of Nepal lack in matters of lack of resources. So, it is suggested for the need to equip the health centers with thyroid tests and integrated workforce of physicians and mid-level providers in care delivery of thyroid disorders.",https://www.jnma.com.np/jnma/index.php/jnma/article/download/4240/2870,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Primary information was collected from selected farmers through semi- structured interview schedule, direct observations, focus group discussion to collect information regarding carrot production and marketing. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis. The total average landholding of household was 44.7 Ka in which 22.6 was the total average landholding under carrot cultivation. The average cost of production per Ka of carrot was found to be NRs.14776.75; Gross income was NRs.39833.46 which showed that NRs. 19378.83 was net income in main season per Ka and B: C ratio of main season carrot was 1.31 which means that the carrot farming was the profitable business. The four marketing channel was seen to be used by the farmers in order to sell their commodity in which the majority of farmers get the high price NRs.60/Kg through the local collector. High cost of seed, limited technical knowledge, lack of marketing information and unorganized market were the major problems observed in production and marketing of carrot for the respondent growers in the study area. This suggested establishing regulated or corporate market in Chitwan district and imparting the technical knowledge and extension support so that farmer can adopt improved technologies to increase productivity.

It is also a major cause of mortality in both developed and developing countries. This study was done to determine the bacterial profile causing neonatal sepsis and to assess their susceptibility pattern to various antimicrobial agents. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal among 340 neonates suspected of neonatal sepsis. Blood culture was performed and organisms were identified with Gram staining and conventional biochemical methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Results: The prevalence rate of neonatal sepsis was 20.3%. Among 340 neonates, 52.17% were males and 47.82% were females. Gram positive cocci were the most predominant isolates (88.40%). Among Gram positive cocci Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common isolates (72.46%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (7.24%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.34%) and Enterococcus fecalis (4.34%).

However, in absence of scientific evidence doldrums and conundrums characterised major debates around the perceived and projected roles of the sector. This work reflects on the findings of a research commissioned by the Ministry of Health and Population as part of the private health sector assessment. Here three aspects of the private sector's role in production of human resources for health - geographic distribution, students’ intake and course fees are reported. Methods: A stratified random sample of 44 out of 122 private Health Science Institutes was taken for inclusion in the study. Telephone contact with the principals and administrative chiefs of the selected Institutes was followed by data collection using structured interviews based on questionnaires developed through a consultative process. Guided conversation with officials of professional councils and policy makers in the Ministry of Health and Population was conducted. Data were quantitatively analysed to calculate summary measures and distribution. Results: A third (36.89%) of Institutes was in Kathmandu valley, with 23.77% within Kathmandu city area of the valley, exlcuding parts of Bhaktapur and Lalitpur. Next was Parsa and Chitwan (15.57%), followed by Morang (9.02%) and Kaski (7.38%). Rest of the country had less than a third of total Institutes (31.14%). More than a half (59.84%) were in central region, 17.21% in eastern region, 13.11 % in western region, 7.38 in far western region and 2.46% in mid-western region. A dominant fraction of the Institutes fed on fees by domestic students only (79.55%), with only a fifth (20.45%) of the Institutes having domestic as well as foreign students. Among this fifth of the Institutes foreign students were enrolled only in Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery and Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery. Tuition fees among the Institutes had two-fold gap between the lowest and the highest for the same degree programmes ranging from auxiliary to masters levels. Conclusions: We urge the government to utilise scientific evidence coming from this work and previous local and international examples in prioritising the revision of existing policies, plans and regulations regarding private sector's role in the development of human resources for health.

Schumach. cv Mott) with and without nutrient supplementation via the urea-molasses-mineral block (UMMB) for milk yield, milk fat content and lactometer reading. The experiment was conducted in a 2×2 factorial arrangement of Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 10 replications. The milking cattle of Jersey crossbred from third to fifth parities with similar milk yields and stages of lactation were taken as the experimental animals. The results of the study showed that Rai khanayo (F. semicordata) fodder performed better (p<0.01) than Napier (P. purpureum) for milk yield, milk fat content, and lactometer reading. Likely, significantly enhanced (p<0.05) milk yield with better fat content and lactometer reading were obtained for the UMMB supplemented group. Feeding 10 kg of F. semicordata fodder with 300 g of UMMB supplementation, 10 kg of rice straw and 2 kg of wheat bran as the daily ration improved the milk yield, milk fat content, and lactometer reading considerably (p<0.05) than other treatment combinations in the farmers’ field.

Thanju on my article ‘Water Resources of Nepal: Misconception and Reality’ published in The Rising Nepal on January 23 & 24, 2014.The rivers of Nepal possess sufficient hydropower potentiality to enhance the country’s socio-economic development. However, some spurious expert and vested interest group exaggerated the hydro potentiality and distorted the fact of water resources development prospective in Nepal. This has created confusion among the policymakers, politician and multilateral agencies. As a result, hydropower development in Nepal has headed for wrong course, and now the power sector, the vital impetus for socio-economic development is in dire strait. This paper highlights the uniqueness and distinct technical features of Nepalese Power Sector. In this paper important component like Integrated National Power System/Grid (INPS), Power Generation Modality (Hydropower, Thermal/Nuclear Plants and Diesel Plants) are well described and Master Plan, Project Selection, Construction Schedules and Hydropower potentiality of Nepal are discussed in detail. In a severe power and energy crisis situation in the country, power export is not recommended. Nepal needs 3000 MW to reach the level of other south Asian nations. INPS is owned and operated by NEA; therefore NEA also has the responsibility to prepare master plan for power generation, transmission and distribution. But, the Department Electricity Development a regulatory body of Ministry of Energy of is undertaking / carrying out feasibility study without taking care of INPS/country’s power requirement. This has created duplication of work and confusion; as such the Ministry of Energy deviated from its responsibility of preparing sound policy, regulation and monitoring them strictly.

The study finds their higher effective level to minimize vulnerabilities to paddy production and revenue per farm plot, although these adaptive behaviors are cost effective and local entity. Comparatively, bamboo wall construction is more effective measure in the paddy production than others are (seed switch) to minimize the flooding materials from the flood and the landslides. Thus, low cost indigenous adaption behavior of farmers is effective measure to climate change and climate change induced disasters and events vulnerability in paddy production.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Remittances are considered to be the most significant source of foreign currency that makes strong position of balance of payments, whereas the volume of imports is one of the most significant elements that lowers the volume of foreign currency reserve of the nation. It is generally believed that remittances have positive effects on volume of imports. On the contrary, if there is more imports than exports, it may run out trade deficit. It does make negative impact on the exchange rate of the home country. A weaker currency can raise the value of remittances sent back to the country, encouraging migrants to send more money home that influenced in growth of remittance. To analyze the relationship between remittance and imports, the study used annual data for 46 years from 1975 to 2020 A.D. The study used Vector Autoregressive model as there is no co-integration between the variables as per Johansen's technique. The variance decomposition test is carried out in a similar manner. The results demonstrate that there is a close connection between remittances and imports. But surprisingly, the result of VAR Granger causality test reveals that imports cause remittance rather than the other way around. Since import influences remittances, policymakers should consider enacting policies that discourage import and encourage export.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/55027/42208,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Despite the many efforts made to increase the maize productivity in the country, the results are not much encouraging. This paper was prepared after intensive review of all the information obtained from all available resources to analyze the production of maize and reason for decrease in productivity of maize. The research work conducted in several periods has shown numerous reason such as insect pest, disease, weeds, biotic stress, lack of labour, unavailability of improved seed, poor extension and research Programme and frequent occurrence of drought and many more.

A household survey of 420 houses was conducted to collect information supplemented by meteorological data from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DoHM). Following this, significant increases and decreases in temperature and rainfall were observed on annual and seasonal time scales, respectively. The obtained result shows the annual precipitation trend of the study area is increasing at a rate of 0.24 mm yr-1. The linear trend analysis of the pre-monsoon indicates that the rainfall is increasing at the rate of 0.18 mm yr-1 and the monsoon shows the rainfall is increasing at the rate of 0.57 mm yr-1, whereas the post-monsoon rainfall is decreasing at the rate of 0.02 mm yr-1. The biggest changes in precipitation were observed during the monsoon season. The monsoon precipitation trend in the time series was found to be increasing at a rate of 0.57 mm yr-1. This variation in monsoon rainfall is clearly unfavorable for the agriculture system of the study area. When these recent changes in the temperature and precipitation were compared over 30-year time series data from the weather station, it is apparent that the climate of the study area exhibits fluctuation over time, many of the changes being very erratic. As per the data, all kinds of temperatures are being increased annually. According to the linear trend shown below, average annual temperature, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature are increasing at rates of 0.038°C yr-1, 0.054°C yr-1, and 0.021°C yr-1, respectively.

The paper shows that the remittance inflow and economic growth have bidirectional relationship in the long run, but there is no relationship in the short run. Remittance affects the dynamics of other variables like investment, financial development, and investment on human capital which indirectly affect the performance of the economy through these variables. Findings indicate that remittance could promote financial development in the short run. It also shows the possibility of negative shocks in remittance flow could have a permanent negative effect on educational attainment. It concludes that an environment for investment should be created for enhancing the role of remittance on economic growth. Policies promoting flow of remittance through formal channels and financial literacy should be effective tools for channelizing remittance for economic growth.

Using data from public schools in a rural municipality in Nepal, the study estimates the unit cost of absentee and dropout students by level. Cost of human resource, stationery, utility and fixed costs of building and furniture were the components for estimating unit costs. The findings reveal that the unit cost of students was equivalent to U.S. $295, 130 and 143 for primary, lower-secondary, and secondary levels respectively, and an average of U.S. $189 overall. The resource loss due to dropout was around 28, 12, and 11 percent of the total resource spent for primary, lower secondary and secondary levels respectively with an average of around 16 percent. The combined resource loss from dropouts and absentees were found to be 39, 23 and 20 percent for the different levels. On average, 26 percent of the public-school resource was lost due to dropouts and absentees.

Employees Provident Fund, Citizen Investment Trust, and Social Security Funds are three major competing institutions in the social security market in Nepal. This paper explores the investment of funds accumulated through the contribution of employees for value creation as a means to enhance financial viability and further assesses the long-term sustainability of such programmes. The study is based on reviewing and analyzing the documents relating to the defined objectives and targets, investment policies, investment portfolio, legal framework for investment, and achievements. The study finds that all three social security institutions (SSIs) end up investing the accumulated funds in fixed deposits in the banking and financial institutions (BFIs.). This is despite the act empowering them to mobilize the accumulated funds in several productive sectors and set competitive investment goals. This indicates that they fail to explore productive avenues for sustainable investment of the accumulated funds, which could contribute to the economic development of the nation. The current challenges in the social security system in Nepal are the increasing number of pensioners and the need for sustainable investment; making it imperative for the Nepalese SSIs to evaluate their investment priority; feasibility and diversify for higher and long-term returns; focusing on areas that contribute to economic growth and development; and generating employment opportunities.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/68022/52144,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

It has provided both challenges as well as opportunities to companies and organizations with regard to their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Mandatory CSR could work fulfil the gap wide range of stakeholders’ needs created by the pandemic. This paper aims at investigating the rationale for the mandatory CSR in the era of Post COVID - 19 and contribute the CSR laws to direct how the law can prevent harms to the society beyond philanthropic initiative. The method adopted in this paper is the theoretical review of contextual pandemic situation, policy responses, the mandatory CSR policy of Nepal and other countries. The result shows that the mandatory CSR is humanitarian focused in the west and development in the east. Almost all the CSR laws are drafted with political interest thus, are not supported by regulatory and monitoring mechanism to measure the adequacy of implementation as per the legal requirements.

This technique is based on a principle that bones or human body parts correlate positively with the stature. Stature can be estimated from measurements of various body parts such as arm, leg, feet, finger, facial height, nasal height etc. The aim of study was to correlate Stature of Nepalese with Nasal height and estimate Stature from Nasal height.Methods: A cross-sectional study of 214 healthy adults comprising 110 males and 104 females in the age group of 25 to 35 years were carried out. Study was carried out in central Nepal where people from various parts of Nepal are migrated. Total body height and Nasal height were recorded with stadiometer and sliding caliper respectively.Results: The mean of total body height in the male and female was 160.4 (±6.80) cm and 151.8 (±4.88) cm respectively. The mean of nasal height in the male and female was 4.6 (±0.31) cm and 4.3 (±0.29) cm respectively. This study observed that in both male and female nasal height had positive partial correlation with stature; r = 0.18 for male and 0.19 for female.

Nepal has also faced heavy agricultural land abandonment from the mountain regions in the last two decades. This study is concerned with agricultural land abandonment and its impact on soil erosion in the Madi Watershed, Gandaki Province of Nepal. This study used high-resolution aerial photography and Google Earth images to map cultivated land and its abandonment in 1995 and 2020. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model has been used to estimate soil erosion. Studies revealed that more than 40% of the agricultural land was abandoned from 1995 to 2020 and there is higher spatial variability of abandonment intensity. High altitude and steeper slope areas have a higher intensity of abandonment than in lower altitude and lower slope gradients. There is a significant impact of abandonment of agricultural land on reducing soil erosion from 1995 to 2020. The average rate of soil erosion was quite high in 1995 but decreased to 51.5 percent in 2020. There are higher rates of reduction in soil erosion at higher altitudes and marginal lands like steeper slopes and the areas having lower solar radiation because of the higher proportion of agricultural land abandonment. Thus, it can be concluded that agricultural land abandonment during the last 25 years significantly impacts soil erosion control in the study area.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/63935/48383,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The adoption of rain water harvesting was mostly driven by trainings that farmers received while controlling for age, poverty status and off-farm income. The adoption of RWH technology more than doubles household agricultural and livestock income. Instrumental variable approach was used to check the robustness of the findings. Adopters benefited from an increased supply of irrigation water, which allows them to diversify their crops from cereal production to high-value crops during dry season. Given the many weather-related uncertainties faced by rainfed farmers in Nepal, rain water harvesting is potentially a very useful climate adaptation strategy.

A comparative economic analysis of MSR and SR production in Kanchanpur district Nepal was conducted during March to July 2023. A total of 120 rice-growing farmers including 60 MSR and 60 SR growers were randomly selected from the available grower list to collect primary information by using pre-tested interview schedules. Descriptive statistics, independent sample t-tests, and the Cobb-Douglas production function were employed for the data analysis. The study finding revealed that the average landholding of MSR growers was 0.65 ha/hh, whereas the same for SR growers, was 0.55 ha/hh. The average area for MSR and SR were at 0.53 ha and 0.29 ha, respectively. The average productivity of the SR (3.69 t/ha) in the study area was found to be significantly higher than the MSR (4.61 t/ha). Despite the higher cost of production for SR (Rs. 80309.95/ha) than MSR (Rs. 75048.45/ha), the Benefit-Cost ratio for SR was found to be higher (1.61) than that of MSR (1.38). The analysis of coefficients indicated a decreasing for main season rice and increasing return to scale for spring rice, with sums of coefficients measuring 0.74 and 1.24 respectively. This implies that a 100% increase in expenditure on the variables outlined in the model for MSR and SR led to a 74% and 95% increase in the gross return of rice production. These results underscore the potential advantages of promoting improved seed varieties and adopting commercial farming practices in the spring rice cultivation area. The findings indicated the need to replace manual labor with machinery to reduce costs and increase rice cultivation profits.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The study was conducted to determine profitability, to investigate whether factors of production are being used in economic way, and to find out extension strategies for increasing income of farmers in Dhankuta district of Eastern Nepal. A total of 120 garden pea producing farmers, (60 from Chhathar-Jorpati Rural Municipality and 60 from Mahalaxmi Municipality of Dhankuta), were randomly selected and interviewed using semistructured interview schedule. Descriptive statistics and Cobb-Douglas production function were used to analyze the collected data. The benefit cost ratio (3.54) indicates that the garden pea production in study site was profitable with productivity of 6.59 Mt ha-1 per hectare. The production function revealed that cost on seed and labor have statistically significant effect on gross returns. In contrast, the effect of cost cost on plant nutrients and pesticides were not statistically significant. The sum of regression coefficients was 1.04 which indicates that production function exhibited an increasing return to scale. Thus, extension strategies should be primarily focused on introducing high yielding varieties, use of high quality seeds, providing trainings on improved farming practices, increasing value addition practices and strengthening market infrastructures.

Here, we reviewed various biochar studies carried out in Nepal by different organizations and assessed future potential of biochar as an effective soil amendment. In this review, we have included the biochar pretreated (enriched) with nutrient or added separately in soil. We found that good quality biochar could be produced using the novel flame curtain metal and soil pit          “Kontik” kiln with slow pyrolysis technology.  Biochar produced from Kontiki found having high pH (9.8), organic carbon (OC, 72%), surface area (215 m2g-1) and cation exchange capacity (CEC, 72 cmol kg-1). Further, biochar application improved soil chemical properties (pH, OC, CEC, base cations) and nutrient availability such as available phosphorous (P) and potassium (K). Similarly, biochar addition increased crop yield significantly compared with non-biochar plots. Higher crop yield was achieved when biochar was enriched or charged with cattle urine. Thus, from this study, we suggest that biochar should be prioritized in government programs as a potential soil amendment and scale up or increase its use at farm level.  SAARC J.

Solid waste mainly comprises of organic waste. Proper management of organic waste helps minimize solid waste problem. This study was carried out to assess the production of biogas from canteen’s organic waste as a solution for management of organic waste in Solid Waste Management Technical Support Centre, Lalitpur using innovative urban biogas plant with capacity 1,275 liters for 48 days. The physicochemical parameters of canteen’s waste and bio-slurry were analyzed. Similarly, volume of biogas, volume of methane and carbon dioxide in biogas produced were measured and CO2 reduction from biogas plant was identified. The average values of physicochemical parameters of canteen’s waste lied within the optimum range for biogas production. The biogas plant produced 22.03 liters/kg of waste and 120.47 liters/day of biogas. The produced biogas contained 48.89% methane and 39.11% carbon dioxide on average. The biogas plant could reduce 3.20 tones of CO2 equivalent per annum from 262.50 kg of waste fed for 48 days. The values of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium of bio-slurry indicated it as a better fertilizer. Shapiro-Wilk test showed that the p-value of collected data were greater than 0.05 indicating normal distribution. Linear regression between ambient temperature and biogas production showed that the p-value less than 0.05 indicating significant relationship between them (r2=0.08). The estimated return period of the invested money was 9.5 months in kerosene substitution or 9.7 months in firewood substitution or 9.5 months in LPG substitution. Similarly, the estimated average rate of return was 125.26% in kerosene substitution or 123.72% in firewood substitution or 125.01% in LPG substitution. These results indicated that biogas production using innovative urban biogas plant is better solution for organic waste management.

Understanding the genetic variability of MAP, strains are important in diagnosis, epidemiological investigation, and therefore the formation of strategies for prevention and control of the disease. Thus, this study was designed to grasp the molecular characterization of MAP isolates of Nepal, as pioneer research of this area. Total of 46 MAP isolates obtained from cattle population of three different locations of dairy pocket areas of Chitwan, Nepal were typed using IS1311 polymerase chain reaction-restriction endonuclease analysis (PCR-REA) to research the MAP genotype of Nepal. The extracted DNA samples (n=46) were analyzed for the presence of MAP specific sequences (IS900) using PCR and DNA samples were further subjected to genotype differentiation using IS1311 PCR-REA and IS1311 L2 PCR-REA methods. All the DNA samples were positive for the entire three MAP specific sequences based PCRs. This study revealed that ‘Bison type’ strain is the single most prevalent MAP genotype circulating within the domestic cattle population of Nepal. IS1311 PCR-REA showed that MAP DNA samples of Nepal origin belonged to ‘Bison type’, whereas, IS1311 L2 PCR-REA method showed similarity with ""Indian Bison type"" and different restriction profiles of ‘Bison type’ genotype as compared to non-Indian strains. The study concludes that in Nepal, ""Bison type"" MAP stains was prevalent in all the MAP samples obtained from dairy cattle.

Buffaloes are the main source of milk production in Nepal producing about 65.3% of the total annual milk in the country. Different indigenous breeds such as Lime, Parkote and Gaddi as well as Indian Murrah and Nili Ravi are recorded in Nepal and they are raised in different management and production system. Different genetic and non-genetic factors cause variation in production and reproduction performance between these breeds and within these breeds also. Non genetic factors affecting the performance of these buffaloes are season of calving, parity, management practices, nutrition etc. In this paper, effect of parity on production traits such as colostrum period, lactation length, lactation yield and days to reach peak milk yield as well as reproduction traits such as calving interval, dry period and service period are reviewed. Thus, this paper after reviewing related articles from various journals, proceedings and magazines is aimed to evaluate the effect of parity on reproductive and production efficiency of buffaloes of Nepal. Though the performance of indigenous breed is generally considered low, there is high potential of these breeds under proper breeding and management programs. Int. J. Appl. Sci. Biotechnol.

The study used  Compound growth rate and Markov chain analysis to assess the pattern of temporal changes in  production and import of rice in Nepal for the last one decade. The synthesis of the analysis is presented in both tabular and graphic forms. The results revealed that Nepal is importing rice in increasing trend and not being able to meet national demands despite some increase in rice production and productivity in the last decade. Imports of rice were found in four harmonized system codes from 18 countries and the value of rice import is mounting in recent years. In addition, Compound growth rate analysis showed that the rice import quantity and value were increasing at the rate of 24.48 and 38.11 percent per annum respectively, while production growth was hovering below less than 2% per annum. The higher growth rate of value than quantity showed that mainly import is concentrated on fine and aromatic rice. Further, the study also reveals the direction of trade using Markov chain analysis, which shows that among selected countries, two countries India and the USA were more stable rice exporters to Nepal while China, Thailand, and Italy were less stable.

OSCC cases were retrospectively analysed for site, age, gender and habits and the findings were formulated to chart the trends in Chitwan population. Results: The study revealed a male to female ratio of 2.45:1 with the largest number of OSCCs developing in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Most commonly affected site was the buccal mucosa (66.06%), followed by retromolar area (19%), floor of the mouth (10.41%), lateral border of the tongue (1.81%), labial mucosa (2.26%), and palate (0.45%). Smokeless tobacco habit was more prevalent than smoking tobacco in both men as well as women. Chi Square test was done to show association between different variables i.e. between gender to site and gender to habit and gender to different grades of cancer, which were found to be non-significant. Conclusions: Oral cancer is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with an incidence rate that varies widely by geographic location. Even within one geographical location, the variations are seen among groups categorized by age, sex, site or habit.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JCMSN/article/download/24109/23135,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Among them, the flood is one of the natural disasters and that occurred in the Narayani River basin. The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising. In order to effectively manage and prepare for potential flood hazards in the study area, an analysis of the flood risk assessment was conducted by taking into consideration three primary factors: the flood hazard map, flood exposure, and flood vulnerability. The layers of the population, crops, schools, hospitals, and road network were all exposed to flooding, and the factors that determined flood vulnerabilities were literacy, urban area, and agecomposition (less than 14 and more than 65). The higher flood risk area was found in Ward number 1, 3, 4,16,18,26 of Bharatpur metropolitan, Gaindakot municipality ward number 1 and 12, 15 of Madhyabindu Municipality.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-74923-1_822,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

About 56% of the households receive remittances, the country also has high rates of undernutrition as 36% of children under five years of age are stunted. Remittance are known to increase household income, potentially contributing to improvements in health and nutrition of children, but few studies have examined it in the Nepalese context. Methods: We used data of 2,498 children under 5 years of age from the Nepal Living Standard Survey 2010/11 to investigate associations between childhood stunting and household remittances. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of child stunting by remittances received by the families in the 12 months preceding the survey. Guided by a conceptual framework, the model was adjusted for variables representing child, maternal and household level characteristics. Results: Our investigation showed that the odds of a child being stunted decreased with increased levels of remittance received by households, 67% (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.67) lower for households receiving more than Nrs.60,000 remittance per year. However, there was no difference in the risk of stunting by gender of the household head and income categories.Conclusions: An increased household income could potentially reduce the burden of chronic undernutrition in poor families in Nepal, which in turn paves a path for the expansion of cash transfer programs. Further research is indicated to understand the threshold of remittance or cash transfer needed to estimate nutritional outcomes.Keywords: Income; nutrition; remittance; stunting",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The results analysis showed that most respondents were male (80%). Many respondents were in the adult age group (44%) followed by senior citizens (34%). Most of them were illiterate (68%), had a medium household size, and had a low level of income. The average landholding size was found to be 0.9546 ha. Many of the respondents were not affiliated with the farmers’ groups and did not receive any sort of training. Most respondents were found to be adopters of recommended rice production practices except for the recommended age of seedlings. The Chi-square test showed that farmer group membership and training had a positive and significant relationship with the adoption of recommended production practices. Also, the income of farmers was positively correlated with the adoption of irrigation sources. Major sources of knowledge about rice cultivation among the respondents were found to be neighbors, relatives, fairs and exhibitions, and non-governmental organizations. Lack of better irrigation facilities, poor seed quality, lack of agriculture loans, and disease, and insect pest problems were the major constraints faced by the farmers in rice cultivation.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The secondary data were collected from literature like reports and publications of different institutions. The yield of cardamom in the study area has fallen now by more than 50% than the maximum realized yield to 220 kg ha-1. Cardamom was found to be labor intensive in the study area. Coupled with low market price and low productivity, many farmers felt a loss. However, economic analysis of the area indicated the cardamom farming is profitable. The sensitivity analysis with 20% decrease in price also found the farming to be profitable and viable. The farming is labor intensive and the average annual production cost per hectare was NRs 50,124 considering hired labors only and NRs 74,358 considering both hired and family labor cost per hectare. Among many causes of decline in productivity, many farmers ranked disease as the most devastating.

For this study, proportionate sampling technique was taken to select a total of 120 sample farmers from the five study areas of surkhet district viz. Panchapuri municipality, Lekbesi municipality, Bheriganga municipality, Chaukune rural municipality and Barahataal rural municipality. The study showed that the BC ratio of turmeric production was 1.32 with the total production cost of NRs. 13083.18 and gross revenue of NRs. 17225.91. The low BC ratio was due to the high seed rhizome price which shares about 34.07% of total cost of production and low mechanization. The regression analysis of the obtained data showed that the input resources like human labor, bullock labor, FYM cost and miscellaneous costs are underutilized whereas the seed cost is over utilized. The coefficient of return to scale is 0.317709 which indicates the diminishing rate of return in turmeric production meaning if 10% of the input resource is increased, only 3.2% of production will be increased. Price of turmeric seed rhizomes have been increased by 62.07% in recent 5 years showing the high price variation in seed rhizomes in study area.

To enhance the productivity of vegetables and meet the food security of the increasing global population, farmers were integrating organic and synthetic fertilizers to attain the sustainability of soil health. It was found that 76% of the surveyed farmers were going through market hindrances like lack of proper market, fluctuation in price structure, and poor marketing channel suggesting an immediate need for a proper marketing system in the study area. The highest net return of USD 17588.53 per hectare and B:C ratio of 5.88 in tomatoes illustrated economic viability in vegetable production. Although vegetable production and marketing in Chormara seem a profitable business, the study suggests an immediate need for adoption and scaling up of successful CSA practices, its extension and proper implementation along with the provision of effective marketing channel and setting of minimum prices for the vegetable products based on the cost of cultivation that may overcome the farmer’s problems.",https://journals.aesacademy.org/index.php/aaes/article/download/06-04-016/pdf,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The treatments consisted of different levels of phosphorous viz. 0 Kg ha-1 (control), 20 Kg ha-1, 40 Kg ha-1 and 60 Kg ha-1. Black gram var. BLG 0093-1 was sown at spacing of 40 cm x 5 cm in the plots sized 8 m2. All the growth parameters and yield obtained from each treatment were compared at 5% level of significance. The results showed significantly greater number of branches (13.84), flower buds (11.33), root length (16.27 cm) and secondary roots (16.05) at 60 Kg phosphorus per ha followed by 40 Kg ha-1. However, plant height, pods per plant, seeds per pod, weight of pods per plant, biomass and grain yield showed non-significant results at similar levels of phosphorus (60 Kg ha-1). Though non-significant, higher number of fruiting branch, number of nodules, effective nodules, 1000 grain weight and harvest index were observed at 40 Kg ha-1 phosphorus. The findings suggested a gradual increase in the yield with increasing levels of phosphorus with the highest gross return from 60 Kg ha-1 phosphorus. However, since the variation in grain yield among the treatments was not significant, the cost involved with the 60 Kg ha-1 was greater as compared to 40 Kg ha-1 phosphorus, greater benefit was observed with the latter. So, on grounds of greater net return and better BC ratio, 40 Kg ha-1 phosphorus seems to be more profitable for the farmers.",https://nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/70858/54013,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Over the years, rearing of different fish species has been rising worldwide, including Nepal. Marine, along with inland fisheries is getting profitable market, globally. Being a landlocked country, Nepal’s fish farming is solely limited to inland water resources. So, the domestic fish production is very few which is unable to meet the national demand. The fisheries, at national level, remarkably expanded than the previous decades and total production, trade, and consumption reached an all-time record in 2018. It has provided employment to millions of people across the world. Still many challenges have often hindered the production and marketing. Climatic changes, technological constraints, disease outbreaks, water temperature fluctuations, high cost of inputs, marketing constraints such as unmanaged distribution networks, lack of storage facilities, etc., have lowered down the fishery development.

There is growing evidence that forage and fodder production activity can be a potential adaptation strategy, but adopted in a limited scale. The objective of this study was to identify the determinants of forage and fodder production activity by livestock farmers in the Terai region of Nepal. Primary data collected through household survey of 600 households, 100 from each district in Morang, Sarlahi, Bara, Chitwan, Rupandehi and Banke were analyzed using logistic regression technique. Results showed that western Terai dummy and family size were negatively affecting the adoption of forage and fodder production. Whereas access to credit, size of livestock holding and training were positively and significantly affecting the adoption of the forage and fodder production activity. The magnitude of effect of these significant variables are western Terai dummy (25.2%), family size (92.60%), access to credit dummy (74.21%), size of livestock holding (10.8%) and training dummy (188.80%). Findings of the study suggested that provided opportunity to dairy farmers for participation in training on livestock production management practices and increased access to credit for making investment in dairy enterprises.

The study was conducted in Madhesh Province Siwalik to assess the LULC change over three time periods and to quantify the change in ecosystem services value (ESV) due to LULC change. Remote sensing, Google Earth Engine and Arc GIS were used to prepare the land cover map.

The present study attempts to assess the vulnerability of the community due to climate change for which Chiti area of Besisahar Municipality from Lamjung district of Nepal was selected as the study area. The climate change vulnerability was assessed using the Long Term Research Program (LTRP). The long term climate change vulnerability household surveys from 2014 baseline data to 2016, 2017 and 2019 data were analysed in this study. This study adapted IPCC (2001) methodology i.e. also used by C4 EcoSolutions on their baseline climate change vulnerability assessment. This is a bottom-up, integrative approach that considers both physical and social dimensions at a local level. Consequently, vulnerability is best understood as a function of three components: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Exposure to climate change vulnerability is calculated with sum of changes in temperature, changes in rainfall patterns, changes in rainfall intensity, drought episodes and flooding events. Sensitivity is calculated based on slope failures, soil fertility, changes in natural environment (i) soil cover; ii) levels of river sedimentation; iii) water salinity; iv) river ecosystems; v) forest size; and vi) the presence of invasive species), economic dependency level, irrigation facilities and livelihood sources. The major finding is that Chiti has been facing climate change since last decade and it is found severely vulnerable due to climate change. There is an urgent need of improvement on climate change adaptive capacity which could result of awareness, information on climate change and adaptation, surplus production and change in agricultural practices. The present study has used awareness score based on conceptual awareness, experiential awareness, and engagement of household to talk about climate change and adaptation. The Long Term Research Approach is appropriate to assess climate change vulnerability in community level. Climate change awareness is one of the major components to reduce vulnerability to climate change in the research area.

Methods: This study examines the records of 282 fistula patients identified in Surkhet between 2009 and 2018. Results: There has been reduction in number of women presenting with the most complex vesico-vaginal fistulae and reduction in average number of years women have lived with obstetric fistula before treatment. More women present within one year of injury and better outcome is seen in those with more recent injury. A moderate increase in patients presenting with iatrogenic fistula is seen, (2011 obstetric fistula 77%, iatrogenic 6%, 2018 obstetric fistula 68.5%, iatrogenic 17%). Conclusions: The findings suggest that easier access to maternity care and better fistula awareness is reducing the occurrence of the most severe injuries and improving outcomes.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

It is estimated as pregnancy related maternal mortality ratio (PRMR) in Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). However, 2011 National Population and Household Census (NPHC) gave a very high estimate of this indicator and challenged the 1996 and 2006 NDHS estimates. This warrants the evaluation of these estimates using another reliable source and this study aims to fill that gap. Method: The 2003 Nepal World Health Survey (WHS) data files were used to get PRMR for 1995-2002. SPSS syntax was used to create sibling history to compute PRMR for the country. Standard error was computed to get 95% confidence interval (CI) and compare it with NDHS and NPHC estimates.  Result: Data quality of sibling history was found to be reliable for getting maternal mortality estimates as age and age at death data was good. Adjusted PRMR of 285 was obtained for 1996-2002 with 95% CI of 161-391. This CI overlapped for 2006 NDHS estimate but it did not overlap the 1996 NDHS and 2011 NPHC estimates.  Conclusion: PRMR from 2003 Nepal WHS were found to be consistent with 1996 and 2006 NDHS as per reported confidence intervals but it was not consistent with the 2011 NPHC estimate. As NPHC used indirect method due to poor data quality of observed deaths and live births, it cannot be considered as a reliable estimate of PRMR. Thus, it is recommended to use surveillance based methods to get valid and reliable estimate of PRMR and MMR for Nepal.

Using the time series data of 48 years of the study period from 1975 to 2022, Engle-Granger’s co-integration and error correction models are used to examine the fiscal effects on the trade deficit, and the ARDL model is used to examine the effects on current account deficit. The basic variables used in the analysis are government expenditure to GDP ratio, budget deficit to GDP ratio, trade deficit to GDP ratio, broad money supply to GDP ratio, trade openness, real exchange rate, and real per-capita Indian GDP. Data are taken from the Ministry of Finance, Nepal Rastra Bank, and World Development Indicators. The findings show that the government expenditure to GDP ratio and trade openness positively affect the trade deficit as domestic factors, while real per-capita Indian GDP positively affects the trade deficit as an external factor. Also, the budget deficit to GDP ratio has a positive effect, while the broad money supply to GDP ratio has a negative effect on the current account deficit as domestic factors. The real exchange rate is negatively and real Indian per-capita GDP are positively driving the Nepal’s current account deficit as external factors. This study identifies the real exchange rate with Indian rupees, Indian real per-capita GDP, and financial development as novel explanatory variables of current account deficit and therefore provides additional evidence on external deficit in the context of Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/68023/52145,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The present paper attempts to assess the land use for land use planning and infrastructure development through land evaluation including risk factors. Sambhunath municipality located within Saptari district of Nepal has been used as the study area to test the issues raised. Both qualitative and quantitative methods are used for data generation and analysis. Land use changes have been analyzed for the period 1986 to 2017. Potential land use zones have been identified through land suitability analysis using MCE-AHP and in relation to the risk factors such as flood, soil erosion, landslide, and fire. The infrastructure development plan has been allocated based on land use suitability index maps and planning guidelines. Land use projection have been made through Cellular Automata technique, and land use plans have been developed based on projected land use and optimized through SWOT analysis. Implementation strategy is developed based on legal framework to implement land use plan at local level. The land use change patterns are characterized by the increase of agriculture and built-up area and the decrease in areas under forest cover and water body simultaneously. Altogether 27 different criteria are identified and applied in land use suitability evaluation. Risk prone area is found mostly surrounding to the foot of Chure hill and along Khando river. Almost 46% of the total areas have been planned for future agriculture land use followed by residential, commercial, industrial and public uses which are 201 ha, 26 ha, 3ha, and 345 ha respectively.

In Nepal, the popularity of coffee is increasing for its high economic value. However, its diversity and the status of its genetic mapping have not been studied in Nepal. In the present study, the genetic diversity of 28 coffee accessions was assessed by using twenty-four SSR markers with the aim of studying the variation of coffee in accord with the genetic markers from a molecular approach. With the use of DNA extraction and marker selection for its amplification using PCR tools, a total of 81 loci from SSR were identified. Of all SSR 63.22% showed for mean polymorphism. The mean polymorphic information content of SSR was 0.38, which showed low genetic diversity of SSR markers among Coffea genotypes.  On the basis of the SSR marker, the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrogram constructed showed a similar group of distribution among 28 accessions, which was further supported by a principle coordinate analysis scatter plot. The phylogenetic relationships among the accessions were assessed by SSR marker, which also showed low diversity in coffee genotypes. Our study demonstrated the use of SSR markers in diversity analysis as the data were informative and highly reproducible for evaluating relationships among coffee cultivars in Nepal. The use of more markers systems and a high genotype pool would have been beneficial in accessing more accurately.

Death toll was nearly 9,000 and hundreds of thousands of inhabitants became homeless. The earthquake severely damaged mainly surface structures of hydro projects, access roads, clay mortar stone masonry houses and structurally weak concrete houses. Landslides, rock falls, debris flow, liquefaction, river damming, Landslides Dammed Outburst Flood (LDOF) and Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) are expected earthquake-induced hazards. However, landslides and grounds shaking were responsible for major damaged. A total of 15 hydro projects in operations and under construction were affected by the earthquake. In hydro projects damages were recorded in surface structures such as power house, settling basin, penstock pipes, and diversion weir constructed at base of steep terrains. For instance, surface penstock pipe, lying at base of rock cliff, of running 40 MW Upper Bhote Koshi Project was ruptured by rock falls and as a result flooded surface powerhouse located downstream by water from penstock and headrace tunnel. Similarly, diversion weir, surface settling basin and headrace penstock pipe of running 5 MW Mialung Project were also severely damaged by slides and rock falls. On the other hand, only minor cracking of sprayed concrete at corners and protruded edges in underground structures were observed. In hydro projects, there is a practice of considering seismic load in design of structures but the effects of earthquake induced hazards were not foreseen. This devastating earthquake gave good lessons for design considerations of hydro projects in future.

The purpose of this study was to analyse the job description of public health officials emphasizing the perspective of leadership and management.Methods: Document analysis method was used following the sequential process of skimming, reading and interpretation, and the themes were extracted by content analysis.Results: Job description of public health officials is mostly process and/or function oriented. Most of the officials are responsible for managing program and people rather than leading. Staff inspiration, motivation and encouragement, being one of the most important aspects of leadership, has been ignored in job description. District level officials are specifically assigned to manage programs and staff. As the position increases, the extent of practicing leadership increases and management decreases. Public health administrators have more leadership role as compared to public health officers; however, the proportion of management outweighs the leadership. Regional Directors have more leadership roles than other officials do. Conclusions: Role of public health officials vary from being a manager to a leader. Junior officials are predominantly the managers, mid-level officials are leadership-oriented managers, and top-level officials are leaders having managerial roles .

It increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases even leading to premature death. Almost half of the adults with hypertension had elevated blood pressure during childhood. With globalisation and lifestyle changes, adolescents are exposed to various risk factors. However, diagnosis in this population is difficult due to absence of symptoms. Thus, regular blood pressure screening is essential in these groups. This study aimed to find out the prevalence of hypertension and its determinants among the school going adolescents of Kathmandu, Nepal. Methods: This was a descriptive cross sectional study which included five private secondary schools of Kathmandu, Nepal. The adolescent students studying in classes VIII, IX and X were the study subjects. Two stage cluster random sampling technique was used to select 356 participants. Data collection was done by doing anthropometric measurements, blood pressure measurement and through self administered questionnaire. Results: The study depicted that the prevalence of elevated blood pressure was 12.4%, stage 1 hypertension 32.3% and stage 2 hypertension 9.8%. Similarly, 13.8% were overweight and 1.4% were obese. Bivariate analysis depicted significant association of prevalence of hypertension with gender, religion and obesity (p < 0.05). The multivariate analysis shows that the significant predictors of elevated blood pressure and/or hypertension were gender and obesity. Males were six times more likely to have elevated blood pressure (AOR = 6.058, CI = 2.571 - 14.274) and 2.8 times more likely to be hypertensive (AOR = 2.838, CI = 1.688 - 4.773) compared to females. Similarly, compared to obese/ overweight students, thin and normally built ones have less likelihood of having elevated blood pressure and hypertension. Conclusions: Hypertension has been prevalent among adolescents, due to various behavioural risk factors. This is really challenging and of public health significance.

The return to scale was found 0.563, which signifies that the production function exhibits diminishing returns to scale. The analysis of resource use efficiency indicated that inputs in rice production were not optimally utilized. Inputs such as seeds and chemical fertilizers were underutilized, whereas machine labor, human labor, organic manure, and pesticides cum irrigation were overutilized.

Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 60 farmers and two focus group discussions were held in four different communities. Turmeric is commonly utilized among Nepalese households in the preparation of curries and is considered one of Nepal’s top five major spice crops. Despite being one of the top five-spice crops, Nepal’s dependency on imported turmeric has been growing every year to meet domestic demand due to the gradual decline in domestic production. The simple descriptive and statistical tools including the Cobb-Douglas production function and benefit-cost analysis were used to analyze the result. The benefit-cost ratio was found to be 1.20, indicating that organic turmeric production was a low profitability sub-sector with a productivity of only 9.06 metric tons per hectare. The Cobb- Douglas production function showed that the cost on seed had a non-significant effect on gross returns and other costs like human labour cost, organic manure cost, ploughing cost, and other costs (agriculture equipment, thread, sack/doko, and rhizome treatment) were found statistically significant. Return to scale was calculated using the Cobb- Douglas production function and it was found to be 0.363, indicating that a 10% increase in the cost of production increases the rate of return by 3.63%, which is a diminishing rate of return. As a result, replacing human labour with agricultural machinery, lowering seed costs, and ensuring appropriate market prices are required to boost the productivity and profitability of organic turmeric production in the research area.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The present study aims to find the relationship between gross motor function and nutritional status in these children by comparing the proportion of stunting, wasting and under-weight between the various levels of gross motor function. Methods: Our study was across- sectional study conducted on 82 cases of cerebral palsy between one to five years of age visiting Kanti Children’s Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from May 2017 to September 2018. Their level of gross motor function was ascertained by applying the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and anthropometry was done using standard methods. On the basis of their motor function, the children were divided into two categories: those with poorer motor function who had poor self-mobility even with assistance (GMFCS level 4 and 5) and those with better motor function who had self-mobility with various degrees of assistance (GMFCS level 1, 2 and 3). Wasting, stunting and under-weight were compared between the two categories and odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was estimated for malnutrition. Results: The children belonging to poorer motor function were more likely to be underweight (Odds ratio 3.41; CI 1.36-8.52; p-value 0.008) and stunted (Odds ratio 3.9; CI 1.47-10.53; p-value 0.048) than those with better motor function.

The Gini Coefficient (G.C) was a little bit higher in non-migrating households (G.C 0.287634) than migrating households (G.C 0.24756). This implies that after migration, the disparity in income distribution has somewhat decreased. Finally, it is concluded that the outmigration of people significantly hampered the agricultural production. Although outmigration negatively effects agriculture production, remittance is the main income source of household expenditure.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Sampling was conducted among the total of 90 registered farmers by simple random sampling method. The respondents were categorized into small and large scale farm holders based on the mean of the land holding under potato cultivation. The data were analyzed using SPSS, Stata and Microsoft excel. Cobb Douglas production function was used to find out the technological relationship between inputs used and output produced and to estimate and analyze the return to scale. The result of sociodemographic characters showed that the average household size, dependency ratio and area under potato cultivation was 7.53, 1.05 and 0.081 ha respectively. About 58% of respondents were growing potato in summer season. Human labor was the major input followed by seed, manure and bullock labor in both large and small farms. The production per household (kg), productivity (mt/ha) and price of yield (NRs. /kg) were 937.17, 12.287 and 30.33 respectively and there was significant difference in production (kg) per household between small scale farms (408.70) and large scale farms (1729.86). The total average cost, gross revenue and gross margin per hectare were estimated as NRs. 256,285.293, NRs. 373384.449 and NRs. 117099.156 respectively. The findings showed significant difference of variable cost between small and large scale farm which was due to the significant difference in use of inputs i.e. human and bullock labor mainly. Despite of adoption of improved potato production practices in most farms the average benefit cost ratio was 1.47. From the analysis of Cobb Douglas production function the inputs; human labor, seed and manure had positive relationship with income while bullock labor use had negative relation with the total income. The return to scale value was computed to be 1.033 indicating increasing return to scale in potato production in Achham district. Therefore, the findings suggest that, the production and income can be maximized if existing problems of irrigation, insect-pests, storage and marketing are solved and the inputs are made available in time and used properly.

However, this sector faces considerable challenges, including high certification costs, limited market access, and inadequate infrastructure. Despite the increasing global demand for organic products and a growing interest among local consumers, only 0.3% of Nepal's agricultural land is certified organic. This review analyzes 27 studies that examine the current status, practices, limitations, and prospects of organic fruit cultivation in Nepal. The findings reveal that smallholder farmers comprise most organic fruit growers, primarily using traditional methods such as composting and animal manure, which align well with organic farming principles. However, the lack of certification limits their access to premium markets. To enhance organic fruit production in Nepal, this review emphasizes the need for policy reforms that simplify certification procedures, improve infrastructure, and strengthen market linkages. Increased involvement of cooperatives and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can provide smallholder farmers with essential training, technical guidance, and resource access. Furthermore, raising community awareness through targeted initiatives will boost local demand, encouraging more farmers to adopt organic practices. Despite the existing challenges, the study highlights Nepal's strong potential to compete in the global organic marketplace. By addressing key barriers and promoting sustainable farming practices, Nepal can enhance environmental sustainability, improve rural livelihoods, and strengthen its organic fruit industry.

This is the first issue of volume 25 of JSSN. I take this opportunity to thank all the stakeholders of the JSSN and especially the founder of the JSSN.   A journal is a tool for publishing research and it is important to ensure that the research can be used by the community. They are important tools to disseminate scientific knowledge, improve the quality of research, identify new trends and provide a platform for published authors to showcase their work. Realizing this and with limited resources and experience in publishing, back in 1998 Prof. K. D. Joshi and his team published the first issue of the Journal of Society of Surgeons of Nepal. Because of their initiation, dedication and hard work, today we are here with this 25th volume to you.   The journal is an essential part of the scientific community, and it is essential for the advancement of knowledge. It is an important step in getting published, but publishing a journal is challenging especially in developing countries. Developing countries face unique challenges as compared to developed ones. The challenges of publishing in developing countries include lack of funds and limited resources, low quality of submissions, lack of qualified reviewers and editors, lack of publishers' support, low standards of proofreading etc. Scientific journals have become expensive to produce and there is little or no financial support available for their production. The costs include printing, distribution costs, website hosting and maintenance costs. While the whole of the editorial team are volunteers and some even have to spend out of their pocket for the journal. That’s the reason why there are not enough qualified volunteers for the editorial job in the journal. Most of the burden of work is on one or two persons. The most significant challenge is to get the right kind of peer review as peer review is also a volunteer task. Many authors who send the articles to the journal want early publication. But they don't have time to review articles for the same journal.   We while publishing JSSN face similar challenges. We are thankful to those who spent and are spending time and money on this novel task. This includes all past chief editors, editors, peer reviewers and technical staff.   Despite the challenges, JSSN is moving on to maintain national and international standards. We developed our online platform for article submission, processing and publication in 2014. Now all the new issues after that and most of the previous issues are available online. We received two stars (out of three) in the journal publishing practices and standards (JPPS) framework (https://www.journalquality.info)  in 2020 AD and working on getting three stars. We were able to get indexed in a reputed and prominent Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ, doag.org) in 2021.   Meeting the international standards and getting an index on a different platform is difficult because of a lack of funds and dedicated manpower for the journal. It also requires specific stringent criteria which need subscriptions to service and payment per article or yearly basis which is a burden for publishing societies. Publishing societies should support the journal to go ahead and be of international standard with additional cost if required.   The scientific community needs access to quality peer-reviewed journals that are accessible to researchers from developing countries. To reach this goal, we must invest more resources into supporting the journals and ensuring that they are sustainable. Journal is the face of a professional society like ours and is also one of the most important activities of society.  We are thankful to the Society of Surgeons of Nepal for the support which we have received till now. We hope JSSN will get more support and encouragement in future for the improvement of the quality of the journal and meeting ever-increasing international criteria of journal standards. Once again, we would like to thank all our readers, authors, peer reviewers, present and past editors and technical team for their support.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess outcomes among dental practitioners registered with the Nepal Dental Association from June to July 2021. All members were sent an online form to be filled out through emails. The questionnaire consisted of demographic and practice-related variables details along with a 16-item Oldenburg Burnout Inventory to assess burnout. Exhaustion and disengagement were the two components that were assessed with the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Statistical package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v 11.5 was used for data analysis. Mean, standard deviation, percentage were calculated and chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test were employed for inferential analysis. Results: A total of 155 dental practitioners were included in the study. The mean age of the participants was 32.44 years (SD: 5.20). The prevalence of burnout was found to be 69.7%. The number of practitioners with low exhaustion and low disengagement was 18 (11.6%) only. Burnout was more common among younger (p=0.043) and unmarried (p=0.017) participants. Conclusions: A big proportion of dental practitioners reported burnout. Further research is warranted to identify the stressors causing burnout. Concerned authorities should take note of this phenomenon and work towards reducing it  ",https://nmj.com.np/nmj/index.php/nmj/article/download/153/152,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Studies on CA under Nepal’s rainfed farming systems of Terai and hills of Nepal improved the soil quality, increased individual crop and system yields, reduced labor demand and was economically profitable. However, lack of adequate soil moisture during planting in initial seasons, inadequate tillage equipment and weed management options are the key constraints of rainfed farming to be transformed into CA in initial stages. In Nepal, the introduction of animal-drawn direct seeding equipment, management of residues or mulches, mechanical or herbicidal weed management options for small-scale rainfed hill farmers can be of paramount significance in scaling-out of the CA based practices in Nepal.

Several disturbance activities in tropical forests have reduced the biomass and net primary production (NPP) leading to climate change. Therefore, an accurate estimation of forest biomass and C cycling in context of disturbances is required for implementing REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) policy. Biomass and NPP of trees and shrubs were estimated by using allometric equations while herbaceous biomass was estimated by harvest method. Fine root biomass was determined from soil monolith. The C stock in vegetation was calculated by multiplying C concentration to dry weight. Total stand biomass (Mg∙ha–1) in undisturbed forest stand (US) was 960.4 while in disturbed forest stand (DS) it was 449.1. The biomass (Mg∙ha–1) of trees, shrubs and herbs in US was 948.0, 4.4 and 1.4, respectively, while in DS they were 438.4, 6.1 and 1.2, respectively. Total NPP (Mg∙ha–1∙yr–1) was 26.58 (equivalent to 12.26 Mg C∙ha–1∙yr–1) in US and 14.91 (6.88 Mg C∙ha–1∙yr–1) in DS. Total C input into soil through litter plus root turnover was 6.78 and 3.35 Mg∙ha–1∙yr–1 in US and DS, respectively. Several disturbance activities resulted in the significant loss in stand biomass (53 %), NPP (44 %), and C sequestration capacity of tropical forest in eastern Nepal. The net uptake of carbon by the vegetation is far greater than that returned to the soil by the turnover of fine root and litter. Therefore, both stands of present forest act as carbon accumulating systems. Moreover, disturbance reflects higher C emissions which can be reduced by better management.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40663-016-0070-y.pdf,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

As the economy, population, and living standards proliferate swiftly, municipal solid waste has become a significant challenge, particularly in developing countries such as Nepal. This project aims to size the major components of a green urea plant that uses decomposable and combustible waste as feedstock. 15 CSTR digesters with a volume of 53323.2 m3 produced 41473.2 m3 of biogas to convert 740.6 Tons Per Day (TPD) of decomposable waste and 220.06 TPD of combustible waste into 574.4 TPD of green urea. A circulating fluidized bed gasifier, a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, and an air separation unit using the cryogenic process were also selected. The study also involved picking a tubular steam methane reformer as the primary and an auto-thermal steam methane reformer as the secondary steam methane reformer. The shift reaction was carried out using a catalytic water gas shift reactor, and a three-bed type ammonia reactor was chosen for the Haber Bosch process. Finally, the Snamprogetti process was selected for urea synthesis. In addition, the study involves the preparation of a 2D system layout to understand the process flow and a 3D solid works drawing to visualize the plant design.

The result of the study reveals that there is a significant relationship between the export and economic growth of Nepal. The result showed when export increases by 1 unit then GDP increases by 0.58 units in short run. It indicates that current GDP growth is also affected by past year’s export. Similarly, Granger causality test also shows that export trade caucused to economic growth (p=0.0071) and foreign loan also caucused to economic growth (p=0.0410). It shows that there is a unidirectional causality with economic growth in Nepal. Hence, this study suggests that the policy makers should focus on exportable products which have potential for larger scale productions within the country, and comparative advantage for export trade as well as economic growth in Nepal.

The present paper discusses the availability of biodiversity resources and its contribution in the livelihood of local people in Lamabagar Village Development Committee, Dolakha district, Nepal. The results show that the livelihood of local people depends on biodiversity resources and people use these resources as fuel wood, timber, fodder and forage for household consumption. In addition, these resources are used as raw materials for local industry such as paper industry and are exported to other market towns to sell and generate income. Bio-diversity resources contribute about 22 per cent of the total household income in the study area.

Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are must to reduce morbidity and mortality due to following diseases. Therefore authentic data on these issues are of great importance. The aim of this study was to address this gap and create awareness regarding essence of control of Diabetes and Hypertension among political cadres of Nepal as they play major role in policy making. Materials & Methods:A descriptive cross-sectional study in the political cadres of Nepal was conducted at Pragya Bhawan, Kathmandu on 4th March, 2012 where delegates attended their 3rd National assembly. Standard criteria were used to describe both Hypertension and Diabetes and their respective goals. Awareness and treatment were based on self-report.Results:A total of 291 subjects were included in the study. The prevalence of hypertension was 44.32% while that of Diabetes was 18.56%. The current blood pressure of the study population was 50% within normal range and 50% of them was above normal range, body mass index of 35% was normal and rest was above normal range. 15% of the study population was known diabetic while 33% was known hypertensive. More than 50% of known diabetics had poor control over blood sugar and 72% of the known hypertensive had poor blood pressure control.Conclusion:The scenario of hypertension and diabetes control among the political cadres is not up to the mark. Most of those already having the disease have poor control of blood pressure and blood sugar level. From this, the situation obviously seems more warning in general population and needs well-designed assessment. ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JCMSN/article/download/17694/14996,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Altogether 682, both migrated and non-migrated households were selected using proportionate random sampling from six representative districts covering four provinces and all ecological domains of Nepal. Primary data were collected through households' survey and focus group discussion using structured and pretested interview schedule. The results showed that 26 percent of households have at least one member living abroad for a job opportunity. Most of the migration was male-centric and Chitwan district ranked first among study districts on migration status. About 43 percent of households received more than two hundred thousand annually as remittance and mostly they used that money in household consumption followed by education and loan repayment. Around 54 percent of households agreed that they were using remittances in maize farming mainly for purchasing chemical fertilizer and improved seed. The use of remittance income in mechanization such as buying/using of corn sheller and power tiller was comparatively very less. The results showed insignificant maize productivity but the fallow land holdings of the migrated household were significantly higher than non-migrating households. The issue of migration and fallow land holdings in maize has become an emerging concern to development worker and policy makers. Therefore, the introduction of efficient maize production system along with value addition program that linked with market targeting youth manpower is an urgent need for effective utilization of fallow land.

The study found that there is a significant contribution of broad money supply, market capitalization and NEPSE index to real GDP. But, there is a weak contribution of stock market turnover to real GDP that indicates a liquidity problem in Nepalese stock market.

The study used secondary data covering 19 years from the FY 1996/1997 AD to 2014/2015 AD. It is an analytical study using deductive method, coefficient of determinants, ARDL approach, ADF unit-root test, LM test, heteroscedasticity, Jarque-Bera statistics, and CUSUM test for short and long run effects of independent variables to the dependent variable. The study concluded that both real agricultural foreign aid and real agricultural GDP are fluctuating and the contribution of agricultural sector to GDP has continued to decline. Similarly, there is a positive impact of agricultural foreign aid on agricultural GDP. There is long run co integration between real agricultural foreign aid and real agricultural GDP. Therefore, the government of Nepal should focus on effective use of foreign aid in agricultural development.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/75291/57682,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Honey production is major source of cash income for them. This study was conducted in Dang, Nepal, with the aim to analyze production and marketing economics of honey form A. cerana. Total 55 beekeepers, two beekeeping groups, two collectors and five retailers were selected randomly for interview. The results showed that on average farmers holding 14.55 bee hive with productivity of honey 6.12 kg per hive. The benefit cost ratio was 3.71 and average annual net profit was NRs. 2,646.96 (USD 23.06) per hive. Human labour hours in colony management, number of beehives and number of honey harvest per year were significant factors affecting honey production. Ninety two percent of honey produce was actually marketed through three major marketing channels. Most of the producers directly sold honey to consumer and had higher farm gate price. Overall farm gate price, price spread, producer’s share and marketing efficiency index of honey was NRs. 671.06/kg, NRs. 93.15/kg, 84.12 percent and 5.30 respectively. Absconding behavior of A.cerana was the top production problem and lack of wholesale marketing points was top most marketing problem perceived by farmers.",,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

In Nepal, it has been adopted for more than two decades with its highest success in various crops. As dissemination and up-scaling tools to this approach, Farmers Field School (FFS) is being launched in numerous farming communities. The basic notion of initiation of this program was to mitigate and combat the negative consequence created by chemical pesticides while controlling insect pests in crops. In Nepal, it started in 1997 through a FAO Technical Cooperation Project (TCP). This article summarizes IPM activities ever since TCP to Second Phase of IPM Program (2008-2013) launched by the Government of Nepal with the support of Norwegian government. Until, 2012/013, altogether 3772 FFSs were conducted by PPD and FAO initiatives and 99751 farmers graduated in IPM Program, while 1175 farmers trained as IPM FFS Facilitators. More than 5000 farmers groups benefited from yearlong IPM FFS. Medium level agricultural technicians, government Officers from different disciplines and 25 participants from Council for Vocational Education and Training Centre (CTEVT) were trained as IPM Master Facilitators. IPM policy and participatory system of IPM product certification system were drafted however; they could not be finalized during the project period. Support for Master Degree studies and Bachelor degree mini-thesis were provided to students of various Agriculture Education Institution. Curricula developed for yearlong IPM FFS in different crops were adopted by CTEVT and other Institute in their academic programs. In the the later phase of project, emphasis was towards the institutionalization of the outcomes into regular program of the Government with a modified approach of bio pesticide production, plant clinics and networking. The program ignited and stressed largely on the socio-technical empowerment to the farmers and technicians. Initiation on the marketing of IPM products was also one of the outputs. This should be linked with increasing use of bio pesticides to the healthy food production so that environmentally damaging chemical pesticides may be reduced from the country.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/jpps/article/download/37756/29123,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

In Nepal only six municipalities i.e. Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Pokhara, Dhankuta, Tansen and Ghorahi practice sanitary landfill for waste management and other municipality practices open dumping which has become major cause of environmental and human health hazards (ADB, 2013).Jeetpur Simara Sub-Metropolitan City (JSSMC) is a recently formed sub-metropolitan city. This city has not performed any study on solid waste management till date and lacks data on quantity and composition of municipal solid waste generation that facilitates effective planning of municipal solid waste management. The household survey revealed an average per capita household waste generation rate of 120 g/capita/day. The total Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation is estimated about 15 tons/day and 5475 tons/year. The analysis of household waste composition indicated that the highest waste category was organic waste with 80% followed by plastics with 10%, paper and paper products with 6% and inert with 4%. The composition analysis of institutional wastes revealed 41% paper and paper products, 33% plastics, 13% organic wastes and 13% inert. The study found that commercial waste comprised 59% paper and paper products, 21% plastics, 17% organic and 3% inert. In aggregate, MSW is composed of 56% organic waste, 21% paper and paper products, 19% plastics, and 3% inert. HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue No: 22Page: 45-47Uploaded date: January 14, 2018",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/18996/15517,,SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
