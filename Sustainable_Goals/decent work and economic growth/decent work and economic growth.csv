It considers the annual data of four macroeconomic variables that affect the NEPSE Index; inflation rate, broad money supply, gross domestic product, and per capita income from 2011-2021 and tries to find out the influence of these variables on the NEPSE index (stock prices). It uses the Pearson correlation matrix to study the relationship between stock prices ad macroeconomic variables. The results obtained from correlation analysis revealed that market performance of stock prices is found to respond positively to broad money supply and gross domestic product and negatively to the inflation rate as expected. Also, the NEPSE index is not affected by the changes in the per capita income of the nation. These findings help to build up economic and financial policies in the nation and stabilize the capital stock market in Nepal.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

This is perhaps an unsurprising conclusion, but still worth noting given the current policy debates about development aid around the world, which range from 'close the [World] Bank!' on the one hand to 'triple development aid!' on the other (Verweij and Gyawali 2006). Nepal is strewn with highly expensive development failures that have lined the pockets of Western consultants and companies, as well as less-than-honest domestic decision makers (see Chapters 3, 4 and 10). These include the infamous Arun 3 dam and similarly large hydro projects, often pushed by the World Bank and other aid donors (Chapter 8). They also include the ill-fated privatisation of Bara Forest, foisted upon local communities by a Finnish logging company and the Finnish International Development Agency in the 1980s (Chapter 1).",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Ecologically sensitive areas as well as mountainous regions face some similar challenges when it comes to solid waste management (SWM). This study recommends that solutions need to be steadily built on a framework in order to successfully and sustainably manage mountain waste. This report presents various recommendations and implementable actions that may be adopted in a phased manner in order to overcome SWM challenges faced in mountain areas. The presented recommendations to manage solid waste in mountain areas are generally aligned with the integrated SWM framework and are summarized in the report. This study represents the first attempt of the World Bank to examine SWM issues in these unique, ecologically fragile areas that face concurrent challenges of high poverty and increasing pressures from tourism development. Chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two discusses the current landscape of the SWM sector in Nepal. In chapter three, the report investigates the current situation regarding SWM in the mountain areas of Nepal. Chapter four looks at the complexity of managing solid waste in mountain areas as well as the various challenges and opportunities that arise. Chapter five presents a framework or foundation on which solutions can be steadily built and presents recommendations and related implementable actions along a phased approach. In conclusion, chapter six briefly summarizes the role of the World Bank in the SWM sector and how it can provide support to clients to improve SWM services and practices in mountain areas in the South Asia region and elsewhere.

Actual information on pattern of cancer morbidity and mortality is possible only from population-based registry, which unfortunately is lacking in Nepal. Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine the pattern of cancer occurrence in Nepal with respect to different pertinent variables. Methods: A descriptive cross sectional study was done among 198 admitted patients from Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital using semi-structured interview schedule. Data entry and analysis was done on IBM SPSS V20. Descriptive statistical measures were employed. Results: This study showed that cancer was seen in advanced age group with no sex wise variations. Majority was married, literate, from rural area, of upper caste and upper lower socioeconomic status. Cancer of lung, rectum and bile duct were more frequent in males in contrary to that of breast, ovary and cervix in females. Malignant neoplasm of digestive organs in males and that of female genital organs in females were the commonest to occur according to ICD-10 classification. Conclusions: Cancer is rapidly emerging non-communicable disease throughout the world.

The main aim of this study is to identify and evaluate the durability characteristics of some sandstones against slaking, freezing-thawing and abrasion. Lithosomes were characterized in the field. The following laboratory tests included measurements of dry density, specific gravity, water absorption, Slake Durability Index (SDI), Sulphate Soundness (SS), and Los Angles Abrasion (LAA). Sandstones from the Lower Siwalik Subgroup (LSS) are massive to cross-stratified, very fine- to medium-grained, and occasionally calcareous, whereas the sandstone from the Middle Siwalik Subgroup (MSS) are mostly cross-stratified to few massive, medium- to coarse-grained with salt-and-pepper appearance, and uncommonly calcareous. Sandstones have four different types of deterioration and had high to extremely high SDI. The majority of the sandstones have displayed similar slaking tendencies. Under the five-cycle SS test, the majority of sandstones from LSS and MSS have experienced low final weight loss (below 10%). However, two from LSS and three from MSS have experienced greater final weight loss. The LAA values range from 29.66% to 99.14%, and except two sandstones from LSS, rest of the samples have exceeded 45% abrasion showing they were incompetent in terms of abrasion test, and are highly susceptible to abrasion. The uniformity factor ranges from 0.21 to 0.44 indicating that all the sandstones were of non-uniform hardness. Correlation among physical parameter and durability indices was weak to moderate probably because of varied nature of sandstones.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/50823/37954,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Every invention in today’s World is the result of empirical knowledge that our precedents collected which is also known as indigenous knowledge. In this paper, we have intended to study the indigenous knowledge and practices of a Nepali community. A study was conducted in Phedi Khola Rural Municipality, Syangja, Nepal to investigate indigenous knowledge and practices of the Gurung Community residing in the study area. The study covers various indigenous technologies used by the Gurung community in aspects such as seed management, crop management, disease pest management, storage, and other indigenous practices. Farmers had rich knowledge regarding the seed selection of different crop varieties. From the result, we can conclude that farmers often conserved local varieties of the crops by using their indigenous knowledge. The existing indigenous knowledge of farmers on crop insect pests and diseases management was not sufficient to secure food in the area. However, the rate of adopting new chemical pesticides and insecticides was negligible. There were various indigenous technologies of the Gurung community with great indigenous knowledge holding from generation to generation. They had both cultural and livelihood importance. The farmers possessed a great deal of local knowledge that can be documented, disseminated, and utilized. The survey provided the fact that these villages had road connections. It has been considered that once the area is totally connected or accessible to the market economy the valuable indigenous knowledge possessed by its inhabitants would be eroded forever. Hence, it was an urgent necessity to conduct a comprehensive study on the indigenous knowledge systems.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Seasonal variations in landslides have been influenced by monsoon activity, while poorly planned and constructed roads exacerbate the issue. The paper aims to highlight the vulnerability of Nepal's geography to landslides through case studies and existing literature. It concludes that landslides result from a complex interplay of geographical, climatic, and anthropogenic elements. To address the situation, the focus should be on sustainable infrastructure development, especially in mid-hills and mountain regions, by considering proper grading and drainage patterns during road construction.

A field experiment was conducted to assess the combined application of vermicompost, chemical fertilizer and biofertilizer on the growth, yield, and  nitrogen uptake of wheat at Rampur Chitwan from November 2021 to April 2022. The experiment was laid out in a strip-split plot design with five N levels as horizontal factors (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% of recommended dose), two vermicompost levels (0 and 5 t ha-1) as the vertical factor, and two biofertilizer levels (with and without application) as the sub-plot factor with three replications. Data on growth, yield attributes and yield of wheat, nitrogen uptake were   collected, analyzed and presented. The research result revealed a significant influence of biofertilizer and nitrogen levels on grain yield of wheat. Full dose of nitrogen resulted a significantly higher grain yield (4441.71 kg ha-1) than other nitrogen levels (0, 25, 50, 75 % of recommended dose with grain yield 2792.11, 2982.20, 3771.17. 4231.63 kg ha-1 respectively).

The experiences gathered from Irrigation Sector Projects implemented under various donor agencies such as the World Bank (WB), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and UN/ILO have shown that successful irrigation projects must be defined and planned according to specific ecological regions and pertinent to the local environment. An integrated development approach considers the land use, roads, market, and other economic activities as they relate to prospects for poverty alleviation. Land evaluation and subsequent land use planning according to the soil, climate, land profile, and suitability of agriculture practices should be considered in the development works to ensure true benefit to the rural populations. The integrated approach as such will provide long term sustainability through environmentally sound practices. This approach has been widely applied in the European countries, Korea, Japan, and Sri Lanka.This paper primarily focuses on the irrigation and development approaches most suitable to Nepal’s three ecological regions. High mountain regions should be developed with pasture land, horticulture, organic vegetable farming, and tourism. Irrigation technology in these areas should be simple pipe conveyance, and tank irrigation. In the mid-hills horticulture on the sloping terrain and cereal crops in the river valleys with other diversified cropping systems should be applied. The Terai region is the ‘Bread Basket’ of Nepal, and has high potential for diversified agriculture and industrial development.For development in these regions to succeed, road networks and transportation facilities are essential to economic growth. Road transportation maximizes opportunity for tourism and other economic activities. Development work must be planned in an integrated approach, which should be based on appropriate land use patterns for environmentally sustainable practices. An ideal solution would be to envision the watershed as the unit for eco-friendly sustainable development planning involving all the stakeholders under the watershed purview. As an example, the principles of Integrated Water Resources Management Planning (IWRMP), and Integrated Watershed Management Plan (IWMP) have been successfully applied in the USA and Australia (Box 1). It has illustrated that vegetative covered catchment stores large amount of rain water, increases groundwater table, reduces erosion of soil, and lastly decreases the intensity of flood hazard. Whereas, the naked catchment areas are highly erodible, does not store rain water, susceptible to high erosion and landslides, and increases the flood intensity by three fold than a vegetative covered one. The vegetative cover increases the water resources availability for over all development for agriculture.                               HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 20Page: 31-40",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/16486/13409,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

It seeks to develop understanding of human experiences relating to disease, disability and death, through humanities, arts and social sciences. In 2018, Patan Academy of Health Sciences Nepal introduced an eight-week medical humanities course for new medical students. This study aims to evaluate the course from the student participants’ view, exploring their perceptions and experiences. Methods: A mixed method study was used to assess the perceptions of  65 students who completed a semi-structured survey, comprising eight items, with five point- Likert scale and three open response questions. Quantitative data was analysed with results expressed as mean, standard deviation and percentage. Qualitative data was coded and analysed thematically. Results: The students’ perception of the course was strongly positive where 98.5% agreed or strongly agreed it was enjoyable and interesting (items 1,2) and should be continued (item 9). 97% agreed or strongly agreed it made them think differently (item 5) and 96.9% that it was relevant to future careers (item 6). 96.9% agreed or strongly agreed the course helped them understand doctor’s caring roles (item 10) and 92.3% believed it will make them better doctors (item 11). Three themes emerged from open response questions related to perceptions- enjoyable and interesting, positive personal impact and valuable and important.

Nepali city leaders are also aspiring to make their cities smart. A smart city basically has clever improvements made in three sectors of its operations: technological, human, and institutional. Globally, many cities have recently made impressive enhancements in at least one or more of these areas. Nepal’s National Planning Commission (NPC) in 2016 had released a concept paper on smart cities for Nepal, defining smart cities as sustainable, information and technology-based, with high quality services and replicable (NPC 2016). As most Nepali cities still operate with limited infrastructure, services, and amenities, making them smart is a challenging task. However, some elements of a smart city can be incrementally and selectively implemented by the Nepali urban governments. This paper assesses the successes and challenges in some of the smart cities globally, and as an example assesses the pollution reduction and efficiency impact of adopting a bus-rapid transit system in Nepal. It is seen that a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system for the Kathmandu Valley consisting of electrical buses, will drastically reduce air pollution, and improve mobility for the residents. Urban leaders in Nepal can begin to identify such a transit related and other smart elements to be gradually implemented in their cities which will improve efficiency of urban services, enhance quality of life for the urban residents, and promote sustainability of the overall urban system.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/45769/35807,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The programme targets natural forest areas that have high biodiversity, scientific and cultural values but are not covered by the country’s protected area network. So far, eight biodiversity-rich natural forest areas and biological corridors, covering a total area of 133,754.8 hectares (ha) are being managed under this regime, and eight other forests, covering a total area of 194,907.9 ha are in the process of being declared as protected forests in the near future. By reviewing existing literature, policy, legislation and management plans, this paper makes a critical analysis of the protected forest management regime from political economy perspective with special focus on the rights offered to local communities, benefit sharing arrangements and tenure security. Mismatch among the law, policy, and practice; lack of legal clarity on the role, responsibility and authority of stakeholders; unclear benefit sharing arrangement; non-clarity about the rights of non-state right holders; and difference in perceptions of tenure arrangements among the stakeholders are some of the specific issues and challenges related to the management of protected forest. Some other contestations relate to division of authority, and benefits sharing between the government and local communities. There is a need to amend the Forest Act 1993 and Forest Regulations 1995, especially to clarify the legal status of the protected forest council, and address the issues of benefit sharing between the central government and local stakeholders. Another important need relates to adopting a flexible policy and implementation approach to address the contextual differences among different protected forest sites located in different physiographic zones across Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JFL/article/download/23089/19612,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Such screening programs and related data are lacking in less developed countries. We documented and analyzed the mammographic trends at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, a tertiary care referral center, in Kathmandu, Nepal, to develop baseline data which may be helpful in further researches.Methods: In this descriptive study, imaging findings of consecutive patients who had undergone mammography between July 2016 and March 2018 were reviewed after obtaining ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Committee. Ultrasonography and histopathological examination were done as needed. Demographics, presenting complaints, breast density, Breast Imaging, Reporting, Assessment and Data System category and final diagnosis were recorded and analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.Results: There were more diagnostic mammograms (62%) than screening with mastalgia the most common presenting complaint. Breast density was less in screening group. Overall, there were more benign lesions with incidence of breast cancer being 4.4% more in the diagnostic group. The age range varied from 22 to 86 years, with 15% (n=219) below 40 years age accounting for one-third of the cases of extremely dense breast and one-fourth of the suspicious lesions.

Identifiation of the cause in class II div 1 malocclusion with the help of lateral cephalograms is crucial in diagnosis and treatment planning. Materials and Methods: Digital copies of lateral cephalograms of Class II div 1 patients visiting the Orthodontic department at Nobel Medical College were obtained. Web-based digital tracing, Webceph Plus version 1.5.0, was used for Steiner’s and McNamara’s analyses. The cephalometric values were compared with the established values of the Caucasians and the Nepalese norms wherever applicable. The comparison was done using an independent t-test with a level of signifiance set at 5%. Result: As compared to Caucasians and Nepalese normal, Class II div 1 patients in our study had significantly increased ANB angle (6.4±2.1°, p<0.001) and proclined upper (UI-NA=28.7±7.3°, p< 0.001) and lower incisors (LI-NB=29.6±6.9° p<0.001).

This research aims to evaluate the factors associated with premarital sexual behavior and its consequences among Nepalese college-going adolescents and youths. This cross-sectional web-based study included 415 Nepalese students over the age of 18 who were enrolled in a bachelor's degree program in a discipline other than health science. Data was collected from students online using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Pearson's chi-square (χ2) and logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between the independent and outcome variables. Most participants (61.7%) had dating experience and 21.2% had premarital sex. About three-fourths (76.1%) of participants had premarital sex before the age of 20 years and the ages of sexual debut ranged from 13 to 25 years. The major reasons for sexual debut were desire, curiosity, continuation of love relationship, and peer pressure. One-third of students (33.0%) reported having more than two sex partners, and 11.4% had intercourse with commercial sex workers. Among students who had premarital sex, 13.7% of participants or their sex partners, had to undergo abortions because of unintended pregnancies. Having an illiterate parent (AOR=11.0; 95% CI=2.01-60.87), high pocket money (AOR=4.2; 95% CI=1.1-16.2), increased dating culture (AOR=18.8; 95% CI=4.8-74.2), a close friend who has experienced premarital sex (AOR=5.2; 95% CI=2.21-12.21), and exposure to pornography (AOR=97.87; 95% CI= 9.5-10001.4) were predictors of premarital sex among Nepalese college students.

The  purpose of this study was to survey the retention protocols among orthodontists in Nepal. Materials and Method: The complete lists of the names and addresses of orthodontists in Nepal was obtained from the ODOAN. The questionnaire was sent to them which consisted of multiple-choice questions and short answer, related to background information of the individual orthodontist, retention use in general, the frequency of different types of bonded or removable retainers that are used, the retention protocol, the type of retainer used in specific situation.

Development of hydropower project in most economical way possible is the first prerequisite to get maximum benefit from harnessing water resources. The maximum benefit can be achieved only through optimal design of the project. Each project component must be designed considering the required level of factor of safety, performance standards of each component and economy. On this backdrop, this paper intends to optimize the location of cutoffs in headworks to get maximum benefits from use of it in terms of safety and economy.Improper placement of cutoff not only reduces the factor of safety against piping but also curtails the project benefits due to excessive seepage flow. Piping (internal erosion of soil particles under structure) is associated with high exit gradient. It threatens the structural stability and ultimately leads to failure of structure while as excessive seepage flow limits the availability of flow for power generation and reduces the project benefits. So, the optimal design of headworks is an attempt to identify the best location of cutoff to control seepage flow and reduce exit gradient. Five different cases representing different location of cutoff were analyzed and their roles in controlling seepage flow and reducing exit gradient was evaluated to optimize the cutoff location. 2D Finite Element Method (FEM) was used for the seepage analysis. The analysis showed that cutoffs are essential to control seepage flow when dam/weir is founded in pervious soil. However, the best location to place cutoff must be adroitly identified to reap maximum benefit from use of cutoff. The analysis reveals that the role of central cutoff in controlling seepage flow and reducing exit gradient is very limited. Likewise, the u/s cutoff has minimum effect in reducing exit gradient but the d/s cutoff seemed very effective in reducing exit gradient resulting increased factor of safety against piping. Hence, this paper concludes that the d/s end is the optimal location to place cutoff to improve safety and economy of the project. In addition, the use of both u/s and d/s cutoffs extend positive roles both in controlling seepage flow and reducing exit gradient. However, in author’s opinion the construction cost of two cutoffs must be compared with benefit added by use of two cutoffs over use of single d/s cutoff.  HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 21, July, 2017Page: 42-44Upload Date: July 18, 2017",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/17820/14466,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

This study aims at carrying out the value chain analysis of tomato subsector in Palpa district. The specific objectives of the study were identifying the actors involved in value chain of tomato, finding out benefit cost ratio, marketing margin, producer share and value share of value chain actors, preparing value chain map of tomatoes and identifying the key strength, weakness, opportunities, and threats at different nodes of tomato value chain. Data were collected from primary and secondary sources. Primary data was collected by household interview, KII and secondary data was collected through published journals, research articles, reports of PMAMP, AKC and other government organizations. Data analysis was done using SPSS, Ms-Excel, and Stata statistical software. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, benefit cost ratio, Cobb-Douglas production function, correlation analysis and value chain mapping. The opportunities and challenges in tomato value chain was achieved using strength, weakness, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis. From the study it was found that economically active population was 60.9% and majority of tomato growers (69.2%) has agriculture as their primary occupation. The average farm size was 0.7 ha and average area for tomato farming was 0.1 ha. The average productivity of tomato of sampled household was 29Mt/ha under open field condition. The average cost of tomato production was NRs. 18.2/kg. The gross margin and net margin per ha were NRs. 394474.4 and NRs. 362014.2 respectively. Benefit cost ratio was 1.67. Market margin was NRs. 25/kg with producer’s share 54.55% in the mostly used value chain. Similarly, market margin of local value chain was NRs. 15/kg with producer’s share 70% in the local value chain. The result identified that the major actors involved in the value chain were input suppliers, collector/cooperatives, wholesalers, retailers and consumers. The disease/insect infestation was major problem in production while low farm-gate price was major problem in marketing in the study area.

Two agroforestry practices were compared with conventional agriculture with the help of the Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNL) model. The likelihood of adoption was found to be influenced by gender: the male-headed households were more likely to adopt the tree-based farming practice. Having a source of off-farm income was positively associated with the adoption decision of farmers. Area of farmland was found as the major constraint to agroforestry adoption for smallholder farmers. Some other variables that affected positively included livestock herd size, provision of extension service, home-to- forest distance, farmers’ group membership and awareness of farmers about environmental benefits of agroforestry. Irrigation was another adoption constraint that the study area farmers were faced with. The households with a means of transport and with a larger family (household) size were found to be reluctant regarding agroforestry adoption.

The study collected primary information from 60 farmers and 15 traders by using a semi-structured pre-tested questionnaire. The simple descriptive and statistical tools such as Cobb-Douglas production function and benefit-cost ratio were used to analyze the result. The total cost of production of early-season cauliflower was NRs 13588.81 per ropani while the average yield was 727.94 kg per ropani. Further, the gross margin, and net profit per ropani were calculated NRs 25194.54, and NRs 22855.51 respectively. Likewise, the benefit-cost ratio was estimated to be 2.60 that revealed the early season cauliflower production is highly attractive and profitable. The Cobb-Douglas production function showed that cost on manure had a significant contribution in total gross return. The return to scale value was computed to be 0.59 indicating decreasing return to scale in early-season cauliflower. The major marketing channel was found to be Producer-Collector-Wholesaler-Retailer-Consumer with highest price spread of NRs 35/kg.

Economic hardships mean that in such countries, many children and young people are exploited in the labour force and/or are trafficked, placing them at greater risk for being exposed to other forms of maltreatment. Cultural norms endorsing the use of physical and emotional acts to discipline children further exacerbate this risk. Here, we assessed the rates of childhood victimisation experiences and associated mental health problems in Nepalese youth rescued from illegal child labour including trafficking. Methods: One hundred and three young people aged 12–18 years living in out-of-home care institutions and rescued from child labour/trafficking completed translated versions of selected modules from the Juvenile Victimisation Questionnaire, the Youth Inventory and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Care-home employees responsible for looking after the young people completed the Adolescent Symptom Inventory and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Analysis described maltreatment frequencies and compared individuals who had and had not experienced any form of maltreatment on the presence/absence of psychiatric diagnoses. Results: Seventy-two percent of participants experienced some form of maltreatment in their lifetime. Rates for each maltreatment type were 46.6% for physical abuse, 40.77% for emotional abuse, 27.2% for sexual abuse and 33% for neglect. Symptoms indicative of anxiety disorders and trauma were commonly reported especially in victims of childhood maltreatment. Conclusions: Our estimates of physical abuse in this at-risk juvenile sample were commensurate to those reported in general-population youth samples in Nepal, but sexual and emotional abuse rates were somewhat lower. The potential presence of anxiety and trauma in this sample that may result from maltreatment requires replication, but underscores an urgent need for routine mental health screening in rescued child labourers during rehabilitation efforts.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Before using this tool in any population, its validation needs to be assessed. This study was carried out to check validation in cardiac surgical patients in Nepalese patients. Method: This is a prospective observational analytical cohort study in 500 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement surgeries (mitral valve, aortic valve or double valve replacements) and valve and aorta replacement surgeries (Bentall procedure). The data were entered in the Microsoft excel software and were analyzed using Chi Square test from Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Version - 17) package. Calibration power and discriminative power were calculated. Result: The model’s validation was assessed by its calibration and discriminative power. Calibration power was assessed using Hosmer- Lemeshow test (Chi-square test). It gave P value of 0.14 indicating that the model adequately fits the data and can predict mortality. Discriminative power was assessed by calculating area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve which was 0.71 indicating satisfactory discriminative power. In low and moderate risk groups, observed and predicted (additive and logistic) mortality were satisfactory. In high risk group, observed mortality was higher than predicted mortality. Logistic EuroSCORE value was nearer to observed value. Conclusion: EuroSCORE can be applied in Nepalese cardiac surgical patients in low and moderate risk groups satisfactorily though additive EuroSCORE is better in prediction. In high risk groups, logistic and additive EuroSCORE under predicted outcome than the observed mortality. However logistic EuroSCORE was better in this group of patients.

Obviously, the author confirms that Nepal is still in the transition stage where institutional and ethical norms are yet to establish though many political changes occurred in a short span of time. Nepal adopted liberal market economy for speedy economic growth enticed with robust human development. The study attempts to take measure the outcome of new political-economic regime. The objectives of the study are-(i) to assess role of government institutions on economic growth and development in Nepal and (ii) to evaluate institutional performance of Nepal in comparison to other South Asian countries. The secondary data is used for the analysis which captured the period from 2014 to 2022. The data is analysed descriptively. The deductive method is used for the generalization. The study concludes that the average inflation GDP per capita, GDP growth, and doing business are 6.12 percent, 9968.22 USD, 3.36 percent, and 60.11 respectively. Control of corruption performance of Nepal is almost negative throughout the period. Transparency coefficient is medium i.e. 3 out of 6. In the same way, voice and accountability coefficient is also very poor throughout the time Relative analysis suggests that economic variables are sound in Maldives and Bhutan and development variables are sound in Bhutan. In aggregate, Bhutan has done marvellous performance. In both parameters, economic and development, Nepal's position is not encouraging. It is recommended to the government and political parties that they need to understand the urgency of matter and reform government as well as political institutions at the earliest.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/jpd/article/download/67530/51407,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The study applied household questionnaire survey, focus group discussion and field observation to collect information of vegetable farming and the impact of vegetable farming on farmers’ livelihood. The study conducted 45 households questionnaire survey in total using simple random sampling in ward number six of Chhathar Jorpati rural municipality. The statistical analysis of collected field survey data was preformed through correlation test and standard deviation. The result shows that the socio-economic condition and the livelihood of the vegetable farmers is improving in recent years. Before doing commercial vegetable farming, farmers cultivated potatoes and used to exchange their production with cereal crops to the neighboring villages. Farmers used to cultivate maize in their farmland, but due to the climatic and the topographic condition it took almost nine months (from January to October) for production. Among the total households, 24.4 percent farmers have seven members in their family and the average family size is 6.3. The Chhetri is the dominant ethnic group of the study area. Among educated groups, the majorities have completed secondary level of education. Most of the farmers are (35.5%) holding land size between 16 and 20 Ropani (0.82-0.10ha.). The majorities of the farmers cultivated high valued vegetables i. e., cauliflower, cabbage, tomato, pea, radish, carrot and green leafy vegetables. The average income from vegetable farming is NRs. 250000/household per year. Primarily, farmers use their income to manage foods, clothes, children education and daily-required goods.

Imminent water crisis due to climate change, water demanding nature of traditionally cultivated rice, increasing scarcity of labor and escalating labor costs drive the search for alternative management methods to increase water productivity, system sustainability and profitability in rice cultivation. Direct seeded rice (DSR) technique has received much attention and popularity nowadays because of its low-input demanding nature that can mitigate emission of green-house gases and adaption to climatic risks. DSR involves sowing of dry seed into a prepared seedbed, pre-germinated seed into a puddled soil surface and standing water. The development of early maturing varieties and use of efficient nutrient management practices along with increased adoption of integrated weed management techniques have encouraged many farmers to switch from transplanted to DSR culture. DSR technology is highly mechanized in some developed countries like USA, Australia, Japan, China, Korea etc. This shift from traditional rice to DSR will substantially reduce crop water requirements, soil organic-matter turnover, enhanced nutrient management, carbon sequestration, weed management, greenhouse-gas emissions and enhance crop intensification. However, weed and nematode infestation, blast, panicle sterility, lack of suitable varieties for DSR and lodging are major challenges. Based on existing evidences, this paper reviews the integrated package of technologies for DSR, potential advantages and challenges associated with it.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44786/33689,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Based on the time series data sets of GDP, GCF and FLI over 46 years collected from Nepal Rastra Bank, Ministry of Finance, and the World Bank, the paper employed ARDL model and descriptive statistics method. The paper found the short-term relationship between financial liberalization and economic growth. The relationship is positive in all four financial reforms in the different periods. However, the relationship between financial reform and economic growth in 1990 and 2004 are ambiguous, despite their positive marginal effects. Similarly, financial liberalization index (FLI) and real interest have not significant and FLI has not positive impact on economic growth. The result is validated by expansionary descriptive statistics of number of financial institutions, growing credit investment, increasing ATM users and mobilization of resources in the economy. Therefore, the financial liberalization is a good driver having multiplier impact on economic growth but parameters of financial liberalization have not cascaded effects and automatic propelling effects on economic growth for predictable sustainable economic growth. Therefore, the slow and scattered propelling and cascading effects of parameters of financial liberalization are big challenges in Nepalese economy to minimize the risks of unpredictable uncertainty and instability in the banking sector. The results lead further sustainable, certain and predictable financial reforms for cascading and self-propelling effects on economic growth. Therefore, the government of Nepal should continue financial liberalization process for improving fair financial competition and credit investment on productive sectors for maintaining financial stability, economic growth and the welfare of the poor .",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

For this purpose, co-operatives have been providing foundations for uplifting their livelihood through the process of capital formation, landing, and saving in Nepal. However, most of the cooperatives in Nepal have operated and are controlled by rich and elite sections of society.

To ensure the data's suitability for factor analysis using Principal Component Analysis, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, Bartlett's Sphericity test, inter-component correlations, and Cronbach alpha scores for internal consistency were checked, and principal components were extracted. A 25-item safety barrier to safety measures in building construction projects during the COVID-19 pandemic was identified through an extensive review of the literature; six components were retained using Principal Component Analysis which represented the model of choice and explained 62.86 % of the data variance. The components were; inappropriate safety guidelines, psychological working pressure, inadequate hygiene monitoring and control, lack of safety awareness, improper working culture, and insufficient planning and scheduling. The internal consistency for the retained components was high; Cronbach α scores ranged from 0.72 to 0.796. “Inappropriate Safety Guidelines” was the most critical barrier to implementing safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in building construction projects, according to the rankings of the six identified components. It is recommended that construction professionals and regulatory bodies prioritize the development and adherence to robust safety protocols tailored to pandemic conditions.

The regression results showed that cement consumption was not responsive to the trends in interest rates and remittance inflow. To increase cement consumption and foster economic growth, it is recommended by the study to increase government capital expenditures and mobilize remittance inflow into capital formation rather than consumption.

The mechanism of the LSL failure process is not well understood due to the different deformation stages controlled by geological structures and causative/ triggering factors. Regional tectonic structures and local rock mass characteristics play a vital role in the formation of LSLs. Engineering geological characterization was performed to evaluate the rock/soil properties, and the associated state of danger (cracks, seepage, etc.). The rock mass rating (RMR) and geological strength index (GSI) methods were used to estimate rock mass quality and strength parameters. The estimated strength parameters together with laboratory test data were used to set up a two-dimensional (2D) landslide surface to simulate the failure scenarios. The simulation of landslide models was iterated under different loading conditions by incorporating geological heterogeneities. The results have demonstrated that the movement of the slope was affected by different stress conditions over time, which were verified using spatiotemporal landslide data. The landslide exhibited a three-stage failure mechanism with the development of tension-induced cracking at the rear and shearing failure of the critical locking section in the middle section. The tension shear and joint-step-path rupture along joint surfaces occurred during different stages of the landslide failure processes. The simulated results showed that the genetic development of LSL is mainly attributed to the geological structures and sudden changes in stress conditions. Thus, the research outcomes can be illustrative to evaluate the role of geological discontinuities, geotechnical parameters and triggering effects by the numerical simulation techniques for the failure mechanism of LSLs.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57921/43297,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The heavy reliance of industries on fossil fuels (63.4%) despite the abundance of hydroelectricity poses an additional challenge to the green transition of Nepal. The presented work aims to study the possibility of storing and utilizing spilled hydroelectricity due to runoff rivers as a compatible alternative to imported petroleum fuels. This is achieved by converting green hydrogen from water electrolysis and carbon dioxide from carbon capture of hard-to-abate industries into synthetic methane for heating applications via the Sabatier process. An economy-of-scale study was conducted to identify the optimal scale for the reference case (Industries in Makwanpur District Nepal) for establishing the Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) production industry. The techno-economic assessment was carried out for pilot scale and reference scale production unit individually. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed to study the project profitability and the sensitivity of the parameters influencing the feasibility of the production plant. The reference scale for the production of Synthetic Natural Gas was determined to be 40 Tons Per Day (TPD), with a total capital investment of around 72.15 Million USD. Electricity was identified as the most sensitive parameter affecting the levelized cost of production (LCOP). The 40 TPD plant was found to be price competitive to LPG when electricity price is subsidized below 3.55 NPR/unit (2.7 c/unit) from 12 NPR/unit (9.2 c/unit). In the case of the 2 TPD plant, for it to be profitable, the price of electricity must be subsidized to well below 2 NPR/kWh. The study concludes that the possibility of SNG production in Nepal is profitable and price-competitive at large scales and at the same time limited by the low round efficiency due to conversion losses. Additionally, it was observed that highly favorable conditions driven by government policies would be required for the pilot-scale SNG project to be feasible.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2024.1347255/full,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

However, since then, political differences have been curbing the establishment of a federal model in the country. While studies generally focus on the political aspects of this issue, this paper is based on an economic approach. Using the fiscal federalism literature and the practices of western federal countries, the article studies the funding systems that could be put in place to support the various regions of Nepal. Seven criteria for the distribution of funding between provinces are assessed. A principle of pure “fair return” seems difficult to implement due to the lack of revenue of some areas. Strong equalization transfers will be needed in order to ensure, at least, a status quo for everyone. By any criterion, the province including Kathmandu district has to face a gap between revenue and expenditure. This can be explained by the high level of expenditure needed in Kathmandu. The topic of this research has been little explored to date, despite its importance for ensuring an efficient federal model in Nepal.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The study involves the measurement of physicochemical parameters (pH, EC, EH, DO, TDS) of the observed 147 springs and the ionic concentration of the representative 32 springs along the Mai Khola Watershed using standard analytical procedure. The results of the physicochemical parameters and ionic concentration were analysed and interpreted using different indices and graphical methods. The physicochemical parameter suggests that spring water is weakly acidic to alkaline and the measured EC and TDS suggest low interaction of rocks and water therein. The piper diagram indicates Ca2+ and Mg2+ together (alkaline earth metals) dominate over combined Na+ and K+ (alkali metals) and Cl- and SO42- (strong acids) predominate over HCO3- (weak ones). The Gibbs plot also satisfies the movement of groundwater from the precipitation domain to the rock-water interaction domain. The groundwater in this area is derived from a shallow aquifer with low rock-water interaction and the water is good for drinking purpose and excellent to good for irrigation.

Then, the arithmetic means of each activity group were calculated and the standard deviations from the means were taken for measuring the functional specialization.The study revealed that both the degree of urbanization and level of functional specialization have considerably increased during a period of four decades. There were only 16 towns in 1971, which increased to 58 in 2011. The number of specialized towns has increased by six folds from 4 in 1971 to 26 in 2011.

This study revealed that there is a significant increase in natural vegetation in all parts of the watershed. However, there is the highest rate of increase in vegetation in lower plain areas, where the population density is the highest. The overall increase in natural vegetation is because of the decreasing human and livestock population, changes in lifestyle, etc. The highest increase in natural vegetation in lower plain areas is because of the alternative use of cooking energy and building materials in urban and accessible areas, decreasing the number of livestock.

The disease affects the rural poor socio-economical community causing significant death among untreated patients (Per capita income of Nepal US $ 400.00). An effort was made to estimate treatment cost on clinically diagnosed VL patients in three VL endemic districts of Eastern development region of Nepal.Materials & Methods: During one and half year period in 2012/2013, approximately 500 cases were diagnosed as VL from three district hospitals; two zonal hospitals and one tertiary level hospital of Eastern Terai districts of Nepal. Total 172 cases were selected randomly from the three VL endemic districts of Eastern Nepal and interviewed at their homes. Results: On an average, cost for VL treatment during hospitalization was Nepali Rupees (NRS) 4032.67±313.47, where median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 17 (five to 35) days. The patients were  iagnosed symptomatically as VL after 45 ± 6 days of feeling illness. The treatment cost of patient before diagnosis was NRS 2379.93 ± 202.30. Patient reached the treatment center after 17 ± 2 days of diagnosis and referral from community level. Total 83.7% patients came for follow-up after average 30 ± 2 days of discharge with an average expense of RS 360.34 ± 49.88. The death rate of VL patients during treatment and within one month of discharge was 7.6%. It was found that the average funeral cost was NRs 9598.00 ± 1259.00. Conclusion: This study concludes that, average treatment cost for VL treatment during hospital stay was NRs 4032 and before treatment was around NRS 2380 and follow up cost was NRs 360.

The relationship between topography and diurnal cycles of rainfall have been investigated utilizing 13-year (1998–2010) high resolution (0.05° × 0.05°) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) data. An investigation of diurnal cycle of precipitation revealed an afternoon maximum during the pre-monsoon season (March–May) and midnight–early morning maximum during the summer monsoon season (June–August)over the southern slopes of the Himalayas. The summer monsoon exhibited a robust spatial variation of diurnal cycle of precipitation, during afternoon-evening time, primary rainfall peak appeared along the Lesser Himalayas (~2,000–2,200 m above mean sea level), while early-morning rain in contrast showed maximum concentration along the southern margin of the Himalayas (~500–700 m above MSL). An afternoon-evening rainfall peak was attributed to higher rain frequency, whereas early-morning rainfall peak was attributed to fewer but rather intense rainfall. It is suggested that, confluence between down slope and moist south easterly monsoon flow triggers convection near the foothills of the Himalayas during early morning period. The results further suggested the morning precipitation moves southward in the mature monsoon season.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/njst.v15i2.12116Nepal Journal of Science and Technology Vol. 15, No.2 (2014), 57-64",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/12116/9850,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Phenomenologists concentrate on the structures of consciousness as individuals experienced and expressed while turning an objective world or phenomenon into a subjective one through objectivation, internalization and externalization/ institutionalization process. The structuralist holds that the creation of an institution is a reproduction of interaction between structures and actors. And other theorists (e.g., Leach et al., 1999; Ostrom 2005, 2009; Gupta et al., 2010; Young, 2010) consider that institutions for natural resources conflate with social institutions and mediate their relations. Although these theories are not explicit epistemologically in a pragmatic sense, they have indicated language, rules, (embedded) practices and knowledge are the referential artifacts of institutions. These theories are found applicable in the institutionalization/socialization history of CF as it had gone through the social rejection (i.e, objectivation) during the 1970s, internalization during the 1980s, and socialization of it during and after the 1990s. The socialization of CF after the 1990s was due to the formation of CF as a social space (a ‘structure’ or ‘institution’) to discuss social and environmental issues into one place where forest dependent users (‘actors’) rationalize the use of forest and its conservation for local environment in a more pragmatic sense (i.e., mediate people-nature relations). An institution for natural resources is, therefore, the combined perspectives of phenomenologists, structuralists, and those who think institutions as a mediator of people-nature relations. Thus, an institution is political (i.e., relations and interactions) and ecological/economic (i.e., access to natural resources, livelihood practices).",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/35547/27788,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Focusing on two trans-Himalayan corridors connecting Nepal and China, we argue that the Nepal experienced a particular form of disaster capitalism: one in which the geo-logics of power – including trans-Himalayan discourses, practices, and materialities – came to shape political and economic transformations of a country long portrayed as a 'buffer' state between Indian and China. More broadly, we suggest that geo-logics of power result from a combination of geopolitical and geoeconomic power dynamics informed by geological formations and associated socio-natural processes.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14650045.2018.1533818,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Employment is the main source of income of poor people which is still considered to be the most effective vehicle to take them out of poverty. People of rural areas are gradually coming to urban areas. So, economic growth and structural changes are increasingly linked to urbanization process. More people will live in urban settlements than in rural areas. Metropolitan cities of Nepal like Lalitpur can offer the lure of better employment, education, and healthcare and they also contribute disproportionately to the economy of the country.

It is a developmental disorder seen in children usually recognized in school age. A learning disability may not be curable, but with the right support and intervention, children with learning disabilities can succeed in school and go on to successful, often distinguished careers later in life. The study’s objective is to assess the awareness level regarding learning disability among basic level teachers in selected schools of Pokhara. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was adopted among 128 basic level teachers in schools of Pokhara. A structured knowledge questionnaire was developed focusing on learning disabilities. About four Government school were selected by purposive sampling technique and basic level teachers were selected by total enumeration technique. Collected data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 23. Descriptive (mean, frequency, percentage, standard deviation) and inferential statistics (chi-square) test as per the nature of data. Results: The present study revealed that slightly more (50.8%) of the respondents had overall low awareness whereas (49.25%) of the respondents had overall high awareness regarding learning disability.

Combination of such geo-physical and climatic conditions with existing poor socio-economic conditions, unplanned settlements, rapidly increasing population and low level of awareness has put the country in highest risk to multi-hazard events. Fires, floods, landslides and epidemics are the most frequent hazard events, which have cumulatively caused a significant loss of lives and property every year. However, due to diversity in physiographic, climatic and socio-economic conditions within the country, the type, frequency and degree of the impact of such events differs in different places. During the period of 46 years (1971-2016), an average of 2 events have been occurred causing 3 deaths/missing every day. Disaster events occurred most frequently during the months of April, July and August, while relatively lesser number of events have been reported during January, November and December.

This situation demands implementable strategies like supplemental irrigation for mitigating adverse impacts. In spite of the importance of supplemental irrigation, it is not adopted on a wider scale. Hence, this paper aims to assess perceptions of climate change and identify factors that influence the adoption of supplemental irrigation practices. Climate change impact survey data for Province No. 1 (one of the seven provinces in Nepal) with a sample of 800 households were analyzed by using the probit regression model. The results showed that the majority of the farmers perceived increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation, resulting in climate-induced disasters such as drought. Similarly, only about 27% of the households have adopted supplemental irrigation practices. The significant factors influencing the adoption of supplemental irrigation practices were the household head’s number of years of farming experience and education level, distance to motorable roads, operational size of landholding, membership in community-based organizations, and the perception of changes in summer temperature. Considering the empirical results, it is necessary to undertake research on sustainable practices and develop support measures for scaling up this practice as the adoption of this practice is very low in Province No. 1. The policy and strategy should also emphasize enhancing the capacity of farmers in technical and managerial aspects of supplemental irrigation practices, raising awareness about climate change and its impact, and strengthening community-based organizations for sharing and exchanging knowledge and skills. In addition, creating additional employment opportunities to enhance the income of the farmers for mitigating the capital constraint and increasing investment in infrastructures like roads for improving physical access thereby promoting adoption.",https://journals.nasspublishing.com/index.php/rwae/article/download/761/695,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Nepal’s response to the US-led Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) signifies the same. For Nepal, crossing seas was culturally associated with sin as an objective to fulfill the isolationist policy adopted until the political change of 1950. As such, Nepal’s interaction with the sea was not so friendly in the past. However, these historical shreds of evidence cannot suffice as the reason behind her denial of joining the IPS. Most of the available literature divulges the sensitive geographical position of Nepal in the context of the rise of China and the projection of a ‘new Cold War’ for its reluctance to join the Indo-Pacific strategy. However, they fail to probe into the domestic intricacies contributing to the hesitation. In this context, this paper primarily tries to dwell upon the actors and factors that have influenced Nepal’s dubiety in joining the Indo-Pacific Strategy. Thus, this paper aims to fulfill two objectives. First, to analyze the role of geographical sensitivity, and second, to scrutinize the domestic interplay of things. As exploratory qualitative research, this study reviews the official documents, agreements, statements, speeches, and reports from think tanks and newspapers to hypothesize that besides external factors there are integral internal elements that have played a part in Nepal’s denial to join the strategic partnership.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Improper visualization of primary fistulous tract and the associated abscesses or secondary tracts a r e the causes of recurrence. Earlier imaging modalities like conventional fistulography, endosonography and CT scan have had limited role. Even without endorectal coils, 3T MRI has multi-planar imaging capability and excellent soft tissue differentiation to show perianal anatomy, primary and secondary tracts with associated abscesses in relation to sphincter complex. It provides excellent road map to surgeons for preoperative evaluation. The objective of the study was to evaluate the role of 3T MR in imaging of perianal fistulas. Methods: A retrospective study was done among 32 patients who were referred for MR fistulogram for suspected perianal fistula at Jeebanta Advanced Kathmandu Imaging, Durbar Marg, Kathmandu, Nepal. All images and findings were obtained and recorded with the help of Philips Ingenia 3T digital broadband MR scanner. Imaging was performed in oblique coronal and oblique axial plane. MR images were studied and grading system was applied according to the St James’s University Hospital Classification. The data were entered in a performa and was analyzed using IBM SPSS V21. Results: Male to female ratio was 7:1. According to St. James University Hospital MR Imaging classification of perianal fistulas, most of the patients (25%) had Grade 4 followed by (12.5% each) Grade 0, Grade 1 and Grade 2 and (6.3% each) Grade 3 and Grade 5 fistulas. Mean age was 37.28 years (Std. deviation 11.9). Common internal opening in axial image was found at 5 0’ clock positions (31.3%). Mean length of the fistulous tract was 3.9 cm (Std. deviation 2.3). Conclusion: Perianal fistulas are more common in males and Grade 4 fistulas are the commonest.

If one looks at the total quantum of water that flows out of Nepal in one year, the above message sounds valid but as the flow of water is not under anybody’s control and flow occurs under gravity as it precipitates or exits the water springs, it should be considered in two dimensions: volume and time. In my opinion, Nepal is water stressed most of the time of year: flood stressed during the monsoon and drought stressed during the rest of the year. Nepal is rich in ice-mass, which is depleting at an alarming rate due to global warming giving rise to formation and increase in volume of glacial lakes that increases the vulnerability and risks to the economic activities along the river basins. Similarly, Nepal is rich ing round water resource with the total annual replenish able reserve of about 12 BCM mostly located in the Terai plains. The most debatable is the surface water that mostly falls as rain during the monsoon and cascades down crossing into India, is often devastating, as it passes. Nepal’s water resource is generally related to its hydropower potential calculated as 83,000MW by Dr. Hari Man Shrestha back in the sixties. Hydropower potential is a number that is based on the energy potential and the market, therefore, it is changing from time to time due to change in demand pattern and the market rates. Myopic view of looking at the Himalayan waters relating it to energy production as the energy production (TAF-June 2018) comprises a meager percentage of total benefit which lies mostly on multiple use of water directed towards the following two aspects: (1)Reduction in the losses of life and property due to floods and unwanted mountain phenomenon, mostly flood related disaster risk reduction, and (2) Flood Water management for converting the curse of floods into assets by way of its multiple uses, both consumptive as well as non-consumptive including food revolution, navigation, fishery, water supply, replenishment of ground water, energy production and recreation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/24569/20671,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Total 350 participants from five different schools from Lekhnath Muncipality took part in the study and the sampling technique was simple random method by using a random number table. Self administered questionnaires were used to collect information on identification of risk behaviors.Results: Descriptive statistics and Chi square test were computed. Out of 350 adolescents 175 males and remaining 175 females were interviewed. Alcohol and tobacco consumption were more amongst males whereas fast food and soft drinks were more amongst the females. Nearly 40% of the adolescents were not involved in physical activity. Tobacco and alcohol consumption was 26% and 16% respectively, which was higher amongst the late adolescents group studying in the 11th and 12th standard. In this study fruits and vegetables consumption was very less only 42% whereas soft drinks and fast food consumption was more 83% which shows that the adolescents are not aware about their food habits. Some participants did not consume fruits due to low purchasing power to buy fruits.

The paper also highlights that interest groups play differently at different times, but the decision makers must be fair and be bold enough to decide correctly in a way favorable to the need of the country. The paper also states that the country’s hydropower requirement should be the priority focus for its development by way of attracting its nationals in capacity building through self-study, self-finance, self-construction and self-consumption. It is, however, disgusting to note that even the most attractive simple type of moderate size projects needed to be kept for such purpose has been handed over to the outsiders for use outside the country, e.g. the Upper Karnali and Arun-3 projects. Such approach is leading to a situation that Nepal in the future will have to buy her own resources at higher prices from the outsiders.HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 20Page: 1-5",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/16480/13404,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

So, ownership of land has multi-faceted understanding around the world. For the developing country like Nepal having diverse societal arrangements, land tenure system plays important role in economic, social and political structure. As Nepal is in the process of implementing federalization, assessment of land tenure security shall be one of the instruments for developing new land related policies and assessing the effect of new policies afterward. The objective of this paper is to perform SWOT analysis on the status of land tenure security in Nepal by reviewing the history of the tenure system and current tenure system, studying country reports and research papers and analyzing policies and institutions. The study shows that despite some initiatives by government, NGOs, bilateral agencies and media to improve land tenure security, land tenure insecurity prevails in all areas of the country even in registered lands. It is found that stable  rganization, registration of most of the built-up and cultivated land, advocacy to protect the right of landless has strengthened the land tenure security. However, the tenure rights of socially and economically disadvantaged people and displaced people from disasters have not been properly addressed and those people are at high risk of eviction from the place they are living. The study recommends that land tenure insecurity arising from political, legislative and organizational behavior should be managed by appropriate interventions and policy reforms. As most of the analyses of land tenure security in Nepal have been performed in a descriptive way, this study explicitly investigates the issue through SWOT analysis.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJG/article/download/23005/19537,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

In the countries of South-East Asia region, Kala-azar occurs mainly in three countries- India, Bangladesh and Nepal. The disease occurs in agricultural villages where houses are frequently constructed with mud walls. Even people residing in endemic areas have poor practices for its prevention. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 150 community people of Katahari Gaupalika, Morang. Simple Random sampling technique was used for the selection of three wards among seven wards, probability proportionate was used for the selection of the population from the ward. The desired sample was selected purposively. Data were collected from face-to-face interview techniques using a structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done by using SPSS 16 version. Results It is found that nearly two-thirds of the respondents (63.3%) had moderate awareness, more than one-fifth (22%) of the respondents had adequate awareness while (14.7%) of the respondents had inadequate awareness of Kala-azar. Similarly, more than half (55.3%) had moderate preventive practice, (25.3%) had inadequate preventive practice and nearly one-fifth (19.3%) had adequate preventive practice. The mean score for awareness and practice was 16.633 and 5.54 respectively. Conclusion The study was conducted to assess the level of awareness of Kala-azar. This concluded moderate awareness of respondents on Kala-azar which suggested that there is still a need to improve the awareness of the respondents particularly on its causative agent, preventive measures and complication.

Due to the treatment of the disease being predominantly supportive, the prevention of the spread through enhanced and improved vector control and elimination is recommended. The use of eradication programs, impregnated mosquito nets, larvicidal and chromosomal manipulation therapies are the most effective methods to aid and abet the control of this deadly virus. The coming months and response of the spread of the virus to the intimated control programs implemented in Nepal will act as a yardstick for the future development and course of the outbreak of Dengue within the mountainous region.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJE/article/download/50764/38093,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

In addition to the immune system of the children, various factors play a vital role in developing pneumonia in these children. We aimed to analyze the factors in Nepal Demography and Health Survey 2016 that could contribute to developing pneumonia in children under 5. Methods: We used the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) dataset in this analysis. According to World Health Organization (WHO), pneumonia is diagnosed in under five population as having cough and / or difficult breathing, with / without fever. We considered pneumonia if at least two of these symptoms were present. We created three separate variables: having cough (Yes = 1, No = 0), difficulty breathing (Yes = 1, No = 0) and with fever (Yes = 1, No = 0). We assessed the association between pneumonia and other categorical variables using chi-square test and compared means using independent samples t-test. Results: In bivariate analysis, wealth index, use of drug for intestinal parasite and history of diarrhea in past two weeks had statistically significant association in occurrence of pneumonia in children under five years of age. However, in multivariate analysis, occurrence of pneumonia was 1.78 times higher in children with history of recent diarrhea after controlling for wealth index and drug for intestinal parasite. Conclusion: Measures that could prevent the occurrence of diarrhea could also prevent the development of pneumonia in children under five years of age.",https://jnps.org.np/jnps/index.php/jnps/article/download/528/920,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

In the past, collective action represented mainly a concern for access to land and other natural resources for the survival of marginalized groups that included women, lower castes, and indigenous peoples. In the repressive Rana and Panchayat regimes prior to 1990, resistance was passive or just symbolic, and movements were sporadic and localized. However, particularly since 1990, as urbanization and industrialization increased along with the use of chemicals and other substances, some of which are also detrimental to human health, social movements have also been organized to resist the maldistribution of new pollutants and hazardous substances in the society affecting the poor as well as socio-politically and culturally marginalized and oppressed.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Overall, the average premium price that consumers were willing to pay for organic vegetables in country was 26.4%. Age, education, and knowledge-related variables were important determinants at lower premium price while affordability factors such as income, expense on vegetable, marital status, and family size appear to be important determinants of WTP at high premium price for organic vegetables.

However, this foodstuff may be contaminated with heavy metals from the raw ingredients, production, and packaging methods, which could bring serious health issues. Therefore, this study aimed to determine cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (FAAS) in a total of thirty-seven different brands of milk-based, cocoa-based, and sugar-based chocolates available in local grocery shops of Kathmandu city, Nepal and to evaluate associated health risks in children and adults using USEPA deterministic approaches. The results revealed concentrations of Cd, Ni, and Pb in the range of 0.021 – 0.585, 1.90 – 7.24, and 0.57 – 4.29 mg/kg respectively in studied chocolates and an overall mean concentration of 0.199, 4.22, and 1.94 mg/kg respectively. The observed concentrations exceeded the maximum permissible limits set by FAO/WHO (2001). A higher concentration of all studied metals was found in cocoa-based chocolate compared to milk-based and sugar-based chocolates. The positive and significant correlations (p < 0.05) among Cd, Ni, and Pb in studied chocolates indicate the possibility of contamination from common sources. Similarly, the estimated ADDing values were higher for all metals in cocoa-based chocolate for both children and adults. However, children were more prone to metals exposure than adults since their dietary intake was higher than adults. Cocoa-based chocolate in this study posed a non-carcinogenic risk to both children and adults since their hazard index (HI) values exceeded the acceptable limit (>1.0). In addition, Cd and Ni posed carcinogenic risks to both receptor groups through the consumption of all three categories of chocolate.

The exclusive provision of the CDF to FPTP MPs, mostly men from privileged groups, allowed them to strengthen their patronage networks. Voters saw FPTP MPs as delivering development, while considering PR MPs weak.

The PV systems were installed on the rooftop of the Nepal Telecom office at Sundhara, Pokhara, and Biratnagar. The generation data was collected through the web interface of the data logger installed at the sites. Long-term comparison (four years) of the plant at Sundhara and the same system comparison of plants at Pokhara and Biratnagar were performed. Long-term analysis of the plant at Sundhara found that the final yield decreased from 2.91 kWh/kWp in 2019 to 2.21 kWh/kWp in 2022. Similarly, the performance ratio decreased from 91.0% in 2019 to 67.3% in 2022, capacity utilization factor decreased from 12.1% in 2019 to 9.2% in 2022, and system efficiency decreased from 16.8% in 2019 to 12.5% in 2022.  The same system installed at Pokhara and Biratnagar had slightly varied performance owing to the variation in meteorological parameters. The average air temperature at Biratnagar (26.7°C) was higher than at Pokhara (13.1°C) while the amount of solar radiation at Biratnagar was just higher by 4%. This led to the reduction of final yield by 9% at Biratnagar than at Pokhara as higher temperatures at Biratnagar caused more reduction in the power output from the solar panels. Finally, this study provides insights to researchers, PV installers, and panel manufacturers on the actual performance of grid-connected solar PV in Nepal.",https://nepjol.info/index.php/scitech/article/download/60496/45197,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

As time pass by, new emerging health problems, shifting of epidemiological trends in disease patterns, rapid increase in population, new and emerging health problems, increasing commercial interests of private health sector and shrinking resources all contribute in inequity to health care.2  Hence it is extremely important that research addresses priorities and focuses on the most important health issues and conditions. Research must serve as a driver for health system, policies and practice. For this to happen, the health research systems should be fully accountable for sake of transparency and also have to be capable of delivering the desired returns. We are fortune to take benefit from documented experiences from history. The main goal of medical research article is to share one’s valuable experience so as to contribute to the progress of science.3  Conducting a medical research and publishing it in a medical journal, is sharing an important knowledge and experience to the world. A physician from one part of the world may have significant load of certain disease and sharing management experience in that particular disease may help doctors of other part of the world treat such kind of patient. Furthermore, author may also have individual benefits, like higher positions in academic hierarchy.4  The Journal of the institution reflects the academics wealth of the institute. Earlier, only few used to grab opportunities for professional growth via publication, majority of them suffer to lack of publication culture in the institution resulting in fossilization of their professional caliber.5  In developing countries like ours, to do quality medical research is often difficult. Furthermore, getting the article published in medical journal is another challenge. Leading international medical journals underreport on health research priorities for developing countries because of improper material, methods quality. Many factors play role in the paucity of inclusion of research papers from developing countries. Lack of resources like funding, proper man power and less access to scientific literature in similar setting leading to poor research output, faulty manuscript preparation and language proficiency may be the common problems. Inadequate laboratory facilities and training may be the other cause. Hence, researchers in developing countries should be supported and encouraged to produce material of the quality by proper guidance and required trainings. Open access journal is the window to the research world. It is one of the tools to increase publications. These journals facilitate the publication of local research output and may play defining role in helping researcher to improve their publication records, and make it accessible to other researchers. This type of open access journal is an important entity in national publishing that will hopefully gain broader prominence as awareness increases and the above efforts are implemented. To make our journal an index and of international stature is strenuous but with the help from our fraternity, we will surely reach the goal soon. Our journal will surely serve as a medium to access information, updated knowledge and a symbol of ideal journal in Nepal.  This journal is the result of hard work, dedication and sacrifice. We apologize for taking this extra long time to publish but as they say ‘good things come to those who wait’ we proudly present you our journal, our masterpiece. No one is to be blamed for the delay of this process. Working with teachers, selecting experts for review, suggesting authors, verifying manuscripts, editing and proof reading was an arduous job but was done meticulously. We run out of words to express our gratitude to the reviewers who reviewed and upgraded the journal’s contents. It is very hard to imagine this journal with their crucial help and guidance.

The related wave of research has thus turned to analysis of the dynamics of contentious politics from a comparative perspective. Unfortunately, these studies use country level datasets for their analysis, creating a mismatch between the original actor-based theoretical framework and the empirical conceptualization of contentious collective action. We discuss the conceptual challenges this theoretical-empirical gap generates and highlight how contentious dynamics can be studied with a bottom-up sub-national approach. To do so, we present a new fine-grained dataset of contentious collective action in post-conflict Nepal (2007 to 2010). We descriptively show how this type of data can help us improve our understanding of repertoires of contentious politics.

It thrives through humor clubs, comedy shows, and festivals; the most prominent and longest-lasting festival is Gaijatra (the Cow Festival), which has lent itself well to cartooning. Indeed, it is remarkable that cartooning has endured, and even made advancements, given the topsy-turvy world of Nepalese government and politics. However, as the chapter shows, cartoonists faced some harrowing situations in the closing years of the millennium, when there were many changes of political administration, a Maoist military movement, and emergency periods.

It is the most common cause of unilateral corneal blindness which is a major public health concern for developing countries. Incidence of microbial keratitis in Nepal is higher (799/100000 per year) compared to developed countries like United States (11/100000 per year) due to varying epidemiological factors. Early clinical diagnosis, initiation of proper antibiotic therapy, identification of causative microorganism and management of predisposing factors together are necessary for rapid recovery and prevention of severe visual loss.  Methods: This was a retrospective study of all consecutive patients diagnosed with suspected microbial keratitis and subjected to corneal scrapping in Cornea Department of Rapti Eye Hospital who attended during November 2021 to October 2022. The major outcome measures studied were predisposing factors, microbial spectrum, antibiotic sensitivity, treatment outcomes and surgical interventions required. Results: A total of 68 eyes of 68 cases diagnosed with microbial keratitis and subjected to corneal scrapping were enrolled in the study. Mean age of the study participants was 49.6 ± 19.6 years and male to female ratio was 1.96:1. Ocular trauma was the most common predisposing factor (48.5% of cases) followed by use of steroid. Culture was positive in 36.8% of cases of which bacterial isolates were more common than fungal isolates. Streptococcus pneumoniae (37%) and Fusarium species (44.44%) were most common organisms among the bacterial and fungal isolates respectively.  Conclusions: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Fusarium species are the most common bacterial and fungal species causing microbial keratitis in the mid-western region of Nepal with ocular trauma being the commonest predisposing factor. Cefazolin and fluoroquinolones are most effective antibiotics for Gram positive and Gram negative organisms.  ",https://nmj.com.np/nmj/index.php/nmj/article/download/157/156,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Buffalo sacrifice has played a crucially important role in the rituals of the Newar, an indigenous group in Kathmandu. The distribution system for buffalo meat after sacrificial worship practices had been deeply embedded within their caste society. In 2016, the Government of Nepal announced a ban on buffalo slaughter within Kathmandu Valley, deeming it ""pre-modern"" and ""unhygienic."" The meat distributors who slaughter buffaloes in a traditional manner within their residential areas are expected to convert to becoming workers in modern slaughterhouses outside the Kathmandu Valley. The author specifically examines how meat distributors can adjust to this shift by studying the struggles of the Khadgi caste, who have historically engaged in both animal sacrifices and selling meat as their caste-ordained role in Newar society. Consequently, the author reports how the Khadgi adapted tactically to state-instituted modernization.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Full immunisation is a state of obtaining all vaccination according to the Immunisation schedule of Nepal. Methods: The secondary data of Nepal was downloaded from the DHS Program. A total of 1709 children aged 16-23 months were analysed for descriptive statistics. All the analyses were weighted by its sampling weight. The full immunisation status indicates those who completed 1 dose of BCG, 3 doses of Polio, 3 doses of DPT and 1 dose of Measles. The independent variables are further subdivided into enabling, predisposing and external environmental factors. Results: Over half of children (52.6%) were from Terai, nearly a quarter (23.0%) from province 2. More males (53.5%) and the majority of (86.1%) children with birth order one to three were immunised. Mother aged < 20 years (62%), working father (96.1%), working mother (59.7%), educated father (87.3%) and educated mother (70.7%) had children with complete immunisation.

The prevalence of malocclusion is highly variable and its range is very wide and heterogeneous. Aims and Objectives: To assess the prevalence of various malocclusion traits and to evaluate the orthodontic treatment need based on the Dental Health Component (DHC) of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) among the patients visiting the College of Medical Sciences (COMS), Bharatpur, Chitwan. Materials and Method: A total of 530 patients visiting dental OPD, College of Medical Sciences, Bharatpur, Chitwan were included in this study among which 288 were male and 242 were female patients. Out of the total 530 subjects, malocclusion was observed in 359 individuals. Therefore, all subsequent results and fidings reported in the study are based on these 359 subjects exclusively. Intraoral examination was carried out to assess malocclusion based on Angle’s classifiation, overjet, overbite, open bite, crowding, spacing, and crossbite. The statistical test employed in the study was the Chi-Square test, which was utilized to assess the presence of a signifiant difference. Result: The present study showed that Class I (55.2%), malocclusion  was most prevalent followed by Class II (40.9%) and then Class III (3.9%).

Despite a huge amount of money (US$ 4.4 billion) pledged by the international community, reconstruction works could not take place on time. Using participatory approach to reconstruction and development as a theoretical framework and reflexivity as a methodological tool, this paper argues that the delay in reconstruction was caused by the inability of the Government of Nepal (GON) as well as the international community, mainly donors, to encourage local participation. The amount of loan pledged by the international community has increased Nepal’s debt stock rather than really helping those who are affected by the disaster. The paper concludes that the modernist top-down model of development – that both government and donors take for granted – has created roadblocks towards understanding Nepal’s contextual realities.

The paper uses international political economy as a theoretical framework and critical policy sociology as a methodological approach. The key argument of the paper is that, since some of the problematic assumptions of modernism, nationalism, and globalism have guided Nepal's policy agendas, its education system has not addressed multifarious challenges faced by its citizens. The theoretical and methodological approaches taken for exploring the interconnections between education, economy, and politics will be helpful for future researchers to understand the significance of education not only for economic development but also for the institutionalization of democracy in both developed and developing countries.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02188791.2021.2011136,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

This study evaluated spring’s five physicochemical data (pH, EC, TDS, DO and temperature) for 75 springs in two seasons (pre and post monsoon). The aim of the research presented in this paper is to assess physicochemical parameters of spring water, understand their seasonal and spatial variation and the factors controlling the variation. Physicochemical parameters were correlated with each other to understand the processes and an attempt has been made to understand groundwater processes studying the physicochemical parameters. Groundwater is slightly acidic to slightly alkaline with pH ranging from 5.5 to 7.5 and is weakly to very weakly mineralized with EC range of 21.6–234.0 μS/cm in pre-monsoon and 10.5–189.8 μS/cm in post-monsoon. TDS ranged between 5.3–116.9 mg/l and 10.8–94.9 mg/l, DO between 3.1–9.4 mg/l and 2.4–7.3 mg/l and groundwater temperature between 18.4–27.9°C and 19.2–27.4°C in pre-monsoon and post monsoon season respectively. TDS and EC are noted to be higher in pre-monsoon whereas pH, DO and temperature are comparatively higher in post-monsoon. The south-east region of the study area shows minimum groundwater temperature. Minimum concentration of EC and TDS were observed in south-east and north-west part of the study area with values increasing towards the river valley. Groundwater temperature shows inverse relation with elevation, pH and DO while correlated with EC and TDS of groundwater in the region. The measured parameters were seasonally and spatially variable. The results indicate difference for measured physicochemical parameters mainly caused due to results generated by cumulative interactions of monsoonal rain, atmospheric temperature, rock-groundwater interaction, residence time of groundwater and seasonal influences. The change in parameters with respect to elevation and relation between different parameters shows shallow aquifer-related groundwater processes.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57917/43296,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

In the traditional mandis established in India in the 1960s, commission agents (CAs) play a vital role in matchmaking between sellers and buyers, and control market transactions, mainly through the advantages of the mandi structures and gate pass systems, information networks, and credit delivery.

The agricultural produce wholesale markets in Nepal also suffer from similar problems as those in India. The necessary reforms of the regulated wholesale markets have only been partially realized, mainly because of the vested interest of the CAs and other market intermediaries.

The replacement of reciprocity and redistribution produced by the market economy based on the principles of profit making, gain and competition, in which money has a central role, is the key argument that Polanyi brings into consideration. His notion of market economy that is self-regulating by its very nature has been synonymous with the free market practice under economic liberalization policy adopted by the capitalist societies nowadays. Despite his projection of the collapse of the market economy in the future, it is gaining ground along with frequent adjustments, adaptations and compromises with other dynamics of society, which could be considered as a new form of embeddedness.

The author conducted detailed geological studies and mineral exploration in some of the copper and polymetallic prospects and also reviewed the literature related to copper prospects in Nepal. The present research is able to delineate two distinct copper ore mineralization belts extending from west to east and identify the promising sites for copper ore and polymetallic mineralization that could be feasible for mining. The northern mineralization belt lies close to the Main Central Thrust where the mineralization occurs mostly in metamorphic rocks of garnet amphibolite facies in Darchula,Bajhang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Solukhumbu and Ilam districts. The southern mineralization belt in the Lesser Himalaya occurs in low-grade metamorphic rocks of greenschist facies in Dadeldhura, Rukum, Baglung, Myagdi, Tanahun, Dhadhing, Makwanpur, Dolakha, Udaypur, Bhojpur and Ilam districts. Most of these prospects were locally exploited on a small scale by traditional mining before 1951. Almost all mineralization in both belts is related to hydrothermal dissemination, irregular multiple vein type, replacement and cavity fillings and only a few polymetallic mineralizations at the exo-contact zone of granite bodies. The ore minerals were concentrated during the processes of regional metamorphism at the time of Himalayan upheaval. In general, the copper content in the northern belt appears to be higher in grade and tonnage as compared to the southern belt. The frequent association of tungsten, molybdenum, bismuth, nickel, tin, lead, zinc ores and traces of gold suggests the urgent need for further detailed exploration and evaluation of selected prospects which could be economic deposits and feasible for mining.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57919/43295,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Though earthen canal sections are least expensive, simple to maintain and environmentally friendly, they have high seepage rates and demand frequent repair. In the light of need for resource conservation and the general unavailability of labour for maintenance work, a canal lining, though more expensive, may be justifiable in the long run. Technological advances in the construction have made available lighter and more affordable materials that enhance many parts of the irrigation process.It is the private sector that should lead the development of these technologies as they relate to the construction business. We can look to foreign markets to see how canal lining technologies have improved the use of this tool in various environments and soils. In the Nepali context, we use traditional lining techniques like stone or reinforced concrete, which are effective in the plains, but less so in the hills and remote. In this paper, I review some alternatives to traditional canal linings, and examine the virtues of high density polyethylene (HDP) pipe for possible use in irrigation schemes. HYDRO Nepal Journal of Water Energy and EnvironmentVolume- 18, 2016, JanuaryPage -25-29",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/14640/11867,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

In the early years communities were often relatively isolated geographically and forest use was largely for self-consumption. Over the years this has changed greatly and communities are increasingly involved in market economies. Global changes such as internationalization of labour have led to large numbers of Nepalis (mostly men) working outside Nepal. Labour migration has meant the transfer into Nepal of large amounts of income as remittances, leading to significant increase in the wealth of rural people, the emergence of a remittance economy and what has been described as the 'feminization of agriculture'. The aim of this chapter is to elucidate how and to what extent these changes affect local management of forests, and to consider implications for the future of community forestry. Drawing on field research and literature analysis, we demonstrate that effects of the remittance economy are felt in community forestry in four major ways: a) instability of community forestry institutions due to unprecedented migration and feminization of local communities; b) lessening forest-people interdependency; c) shifting social values on wealth maximization; and d) lack of an inclusive and strategic planning system in community forestry. The functioning and sustainability of community forestry is threatened by the rise of the remittance economy in Nepali villages. This chapter highlights some possible ways to make community forestry more resilient in the changing context.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Despite their importance, remittances only gained the attention of scholars and policymakers towards the end of the century. More recently, remittances have become linked to the global financial inclusion agenda in what has been termed the ‘financialisation of remittances’. This article proposes a temporal and spatial shift to explore the historical antecedents of the financialisation of remittances (1900–1960) and beyond the Global North to focus on the context of rural Nepal. I investigate the role of remittances in the reconfiguration of rural finance and social hierarchies. I propose the concept of ‘debt-reign’ as a political formation that allows to analyse the links between statecraft technologies, debt and caste relations, and remittances. Drawing on document analysis, expert interviews and a focus group discussion, the article shows the transformative power of remittances to bring about: the (re)negotiation of debt relations; an emancipation from debt relations; and the reconfiguration of social hierarchies. Together, these dynamics contribute to a reconfiguration of social power, challenging the domination of certain castes and rural elites and re-stratifying financial and social hierarchies. The analysis also highlights the colonial legacies of remittances that prepared the ground to introduce formal financial infrastructure in rural areas which is fundamental to contemporary financialisation.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0308518X221092777,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

It is also commonly used as diagnostic test in the assessment or characterization of palpable breast mass along with ultrasonography. The purpose of our study was to assess the mammographic findings in women undergoing screening and diagnostic mammography. Methods: This was a prospective cross sectional study analyzing the outcomes of 497 consecutive screen-film mammographic examinations, 369 (74.2%) diagnostic and 128 (25.8%) screening, performed in female patients from 4th July 2012 to 15th October 2012 in Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital. Analysis was based on the final assessment report of mammogram reviewed by the experienced radiologists following Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification. BI-RADS score 4, 5 and 6 were considered as positive, BI-RADS score 1, 2 and 3 were considered as negative and BI-RADS score 0 was considered inconclusive requiring additional imaging. Results: The mean age of women was 46.3 years (range 26-83 years). Among 369 cases of diagnostic mammograms 300 (81.3%) were negative, 27 (5.4%) were positive and rest 42 (8.4%) were inconclusive. Among 128 cases of screening mammograms, 117 (91.4%) were negative, 11 (8.6%) were inconclusive and none of them were positive.

Alcoholism is clinically heterogenous disorder with variable age of onset, drinking patterns, severity and comorbidity with other mental disorders. There is a gender difference in many aspect of alcohol use. The aim of the study was to study the sociodemographic profile, severity, gender difference and psychiatric comorbidities in patient with alcohol dependence syndrome in Nepalese population. Material And Method: This is a hospital based study done in patients coming to Nepalgunj Medical College, Kohalpur over a period of one year from June 2019 to May 2020 on consecutive serial basis. Diagnosis of alcohol dependence was made based on International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) criteria. Semi structured proforma and Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ) was applied in those patients and recorded accordingly. The data was analyzed using SPSS. Results: Out of 40 patients studied (N-40), 37 (92.5 %) were male and 3 (7.5 %) were female. Alcohol dependence is most common in the age bracket of 30-39 (43.1%) followed by 40-49 (33.4 %) with mean age of 40.3 years and the mean age of duration of alcohol use being 13.45 years. The mean amount of alcohol consumed per day is 92.25 grams.

Available data were collected from the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MoAD), Department of Agriculture (DoA) and Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC). Green house gas emission (GHG) was estimated by using IPCC 2006 guidelines. Agricultural activities contribute directly to emissions of greenhouse gases through a variety of processes including the source categories such as enteric fermentation in domestic livestock, livestock manure management, rice cultivation, and agricultural soil management. Diverse traditional agriculture systems, unique diversities in land types and unavailability of required disaggregated data at the national level as defined by the emission factor data base (EFDB) of the IPCC 2006, were the problem encountered while calculating the emission status in this study. Annual methane (CH4) emission from paddy fields ranged from 111.57 to 133.07 Gg over years 2000 to 2010 but it was found lowest ( 111.57 Gg) in the year 2002 and highest (133.07 Gg) in the year2003. In the year 2010, methane emission from paddy cultivation represented about 17.48 % of cumulative methane emission both from livestock sector and paddy fields throughout Nepal.

The aim of this review is to identify the goals, interventions, and effectiveness of major infant mortality prevention programs around the country. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. The literature search revealed six programs that Nepal has utilized to combat infant mortality. The Community Based Management of Childhood Illness (CB-IMCI) program utilizes specially trained community workers to help identify and treat children with common childhood illnesses. The National Neonatal Health Strategy (NNHS) links families to the community and then to the broader healthcare system, with success found in its referral system. The Safe Delivery Incentives Program (SDIP) has found success with monetizing safe delivery practices, and shown an increase in safe deliveries with skilled healthcare workers present. Free Newborn Care (FNC) services were aimed at treating sick newborns for free, but ongoing concerns for program sustainability have led to further revision. The Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) is another plan aimed at preventing newborn deaths through improving health system administration and finances, but with limited efficacy data, it is hard to determine its success due to the lack of objective benchmark markers and data collected. Finally, the Birth Preparedness Package (BPP) is a highly efficacious program that encourages communities to plan for pregnancies by planning for delay barriers. Nepal has made significant strides in reducing infant mortality; however, much work still needs to be done.

This chapter examines whether women and men manage household waste differently at the household level, especially at source segregation, managing recyclable waste (paper and plastic), and composting degradable waste. Using household survey data from the Bharatpur Metropolitan City of Nepal, we find that women are more likely to segregate waste at the source and also manage degradable waste at home better. Still, there is no gender difference in selling plastic and paper waste. In contrast, women are more likely to give paper or plastic waste either to the waste collectors (free) or throw away, suggesting a heterogeneity across gender when it comes to managing household waste.

The time series data for 20 years, 2001-2020, are collected from various government sources, such as the Ministry of Finance, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), and the National Statistics Office. This study finds a positive and significant relationship between remittances and private consumption in Nepal. The impact of other control variables like GDP is positive and significant for consumption. However, the consumer price index has a negative effect on consumption. The Nepal government and other concerned agencies should encourage sending remittances only from formal banking channels that could help with capital formation and thereby investment and job creation in Nepal. It also solves the liquidity crisis and foreign exchange constraints in the nation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/68025/52148,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Grounded in longitudinal data from the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey from 1996 to 2022, this study aims to shed light on evolving patterns in pregnancy outcomes and inequities in use of abortion services across ecological zones and wealth quintiles.Methods: Utilizing six rounds of Nepal Demographic and Health Survey data, pregnancy outcomes were categorized as abortion, delivery, miscarriage, or stillbirth. Income-related inequality in the utilization of abortion services was assessed through the concentration index, ranging from -1 to 1. Trends over time were evaluated using the annual rate of change.Results: The ARC indicated a substantial rise in induced abortion rates, surging from 0.4% in 1996 to 8.8% in 2022. In contrast, live births witnessed a decline from 92.8% to 81.2%. Significant variations were observed across ecological zones and wealth quintiles, with the Mountain zone and the Poorest group experiencing the most pronounced increases in induced abortion rates. By 2022, the concentration index reached a near-zero value, signifying a near-elimination of income-related disparities in the use of induced abortion services.Discussion: The findings suggest that while there has been significant progress in access to and use of abortion services in Nepal, particularly post-2002 policy shifts, challenges remain. Women from lower socio-economic backgrounds continue to face barriers, indicating the need for a multi-pronged approach to address residual challenges.Conclusions: Nepal has made remarkable strides in enhancing equitable access to and use of induced abortion services, but more needs to be done to guarantee equitable access for all women. Future efforts should focus on policy reforms, infrastructural improvements, and societal change to eliminate existing barriers to reproductive healthcare.Keywords: Abortion services; concentration Index; socio-economic disparities.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Growth parameters, grain yield, and yield-attributing traits of rice were recorded. The results revealed statistical differences between the treatments in terms of agronomical parameters, yield attributing characters, and grain yield. Results indicate the recommended dose of N application at 3 splits i.e., ¼ at basal+ ½ at 20DAT+ ¼ at 45 DAT contributes to the higher plant height (104.79 cm), the number of tillers (9.88), grain yield (4.9 Mt ha-1) and straw yield (7.44 Mt ha-1). The highest LAI (2.84), flag leaf length (31.063 cm), and effective tillers/m2 (245.41) were obtained in nitrogen application using LCC. Moreover, the recommended dose of N at 3 splits, ¼ at basal + ½ at 20 DAT + ¼ at 45 DAT, and nitrogen application using LCC showed almost similar performance in most of the parameters.

Periodization of history in Nepal establishes a direct and necessary link between modern Nepal and its national territory. Indeed, the beginning of the modern era is determined by the “unification” of the fifty independent kingdoms and tribal territories that gave birth to the anational territory of Nepal during the second half of the 18th century. Such a correspondence makes modernity and the unified territory of Nepal coincide in a single space time. Yet, a closer examination of the logic behind periodization sheds light on its Kathmandu-centric, and dynastic perspective. This resulted in the formation of a hybrid conception of the national territory and of its center of power. From being the standard of the territory’s time and space, the Kathmandu Valley became the chronotope of the historical narrative dealing with the first half of the 19th century. It continued to form the territory’s remarkable center following the seizing of power by the Rana prime ministers (1846–1951), but now by assuming a futurist dimension, which conversely, plunged the rest of the country back in time.</p>",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Crustal thickening led to partial melting and formation of leucogranite melts along the top of the GHS, from earlier muscovite dehydration to later biotite dehydration melting with time. The granite was not a diapiric intrusion and does not intrude across the STD low-angle normal fault. A low-angle, north-dipping normal fault, the ductile-brittle Nar-Phu detachment wraps around the top of the Manaslu leucogranite and truncates all leucogranites in the footwall. The detachment formed the roof fault during exhumation of footwall rocks (channel flow) along the upper GHS during the early-middle Miocene. Metamorphism is also entirely regional and not contact metamorphism. U-Th/Pb monazite ages from metapelites show semi-continuous metamorphism across the GHS from ~35-15 Ma. The leucogranites were emplaced as layer-parallel sills entirely within the GHS between ~25-18.5 Ma.

One third of GDP comes from agriculture and there are numerous opportunities in agriculture mainly because of varied agro-climate prevailed in the country. Niche specific commodities that have comparative advantage could be produced in fair quantity to meet the demand of huge market of neighboring India and China as purchasing capacity of people in those countries has improved markedly mainly for quality agriculture commodities. Trade deficit, food insecurity, income generation, poverty reduction, and employment generation could be addressed by turning present status of subsistence agriculture into robust, vibrant and commercial agriculture through technology led agro-industrialization. There are agro-commodities which are imported from India and other countries in huge quantity by the scarce hard currency earned through remittance. Evidence shows that almost 70% of the remittance is spent for agriculture commodities which have high potentiality to produce within the country even after local consumption. Such produce could be exported to other countries to mitigate trade imbalance, enhance export promotion and import reduction and promote graduating Nepal from LDC to DC within the stipulated time frame as proposed a couple of years ago by the government of Nepal. Nepal should come up with functional, pragmatic and implementable agriculture plan and policy to harness huge possibility of agriculture commercialization to meet the consumption demand per se within and outside the country. This paper highlights to address prospects and limitations of agriculture commercialization and suggests some way forward to make agriculture more vibrant and robust to address trade deficit, food and nutritional insecurity and livelihood enhancement of Nepalese as a whole thereby Nepal can tailor her pace of development with neighboring countries to meet the aspiration of Nepalese in the 21st century.Agronomy Journal of Nepal (Agron JN) vol. 4, 2016, Page: 38-63",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/15515/12519,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The quality, content and processing of negative thoughts initiate depressive symptoms; i.e. low mood, decreased self-worth and diminished interest in pleasurable activities. The study assessed the automatic thoughts of patients having depressive illness and evaluated and compared the changes after therapy; i.e. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.Methods: Diagnosed cases of depressive illness (n=135),  according to ICD-10 and study criteria, attending the out-patient clinic of Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, were included. Beck Depression Inventory was used to screen level of depressive symptoms. Automatic thoughts were assessed by the Automatic Thought Questionnaire-Revised before initiating therapy and after completion of therapy for comparison.  Depressive patients received either of the three treatment procedures after randomization of the study sample into three different treatment groups; i.e. Cognitive behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy or combined therapy receiving both cognitive behavior therapy and pharmacotherapy.Results: Among the total 135 patients, 53 (39.3%) had moderate, 47 (34.8%) had severe depressive and 35 (25.9%) had mild depressive symptoms before therapeutic interventions. Negative automatic thoughts were significantly present in depressed patients and reduced after all three interventions. Negative automatic thoughts of hopelessness, anxiety and inability coping were significantly reduced after therapy.Conclusions: Automatic negative thoughts were significantly correlated with depressive disorder. Combined therapy CBT with pharmacotherapy or CBT alone was found to be more effective in modifying automatic negative thoughts than pharmacotherapy alone, ultimately reducing depressive symptoms to a significant degree.Keywords: automatic thoughts; cognitive Behavior therapy; pharmacotherapy. [PubMed]",https://www.jnma.com.np/jnma/index.php/jnma/article/download/3101/2634,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

A total of 20 key informant interviews (KII) were also conducted to understand the perception of farm households on commercial vegetable farming. The result shows that around 94% of the total sampled farm households have leasehold farmland that has spread to different settlements of Kirtipur Municipality. Out of total leasehold farmers, 69% have written agreement with the landowner. The result also shows that the farmers cultivate vegetables in an average area of 5.67 ropani (2884.49m2). Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) are the primary vegetable products, whereas cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) and other green leafy vegetables are mostly cultivated as secondary vegetable products. Dug wells are the major sources of irrigation on vegetable farmland.

The second and largest group of internally displaced persons are the collateral victims of the armed conflict, primarily poor villagers who have fled their home land due to general insecurity, degradation of the local economy and services, food scarcity, fear of abduction by the Maoists, or fear of harassment and violence by either the Maoists or the government's security forces (including the national police, Armed Police Force and Nepalese Army). This group includes a wide range of rural castes and ethnicities. The internal displacement of villagers has not been chaotic and random, however. These IDPs have generally followed routes already established by rural-to-urban labour migration, settling in destinations and finding employment with the assistance of already-migrated family and community members. The third groups of IDPs due to the armed conflict are youth, primarily boys and young men above the age of 12.

Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) (36.2%; n= 145), diabetes mellitus (31.9%; n= 128) and hypertension (21.7%; n=87) were the three most common identified causes of CKD. Among the biopsy proven CGN patients, IgA nephropathy was the most common cause. In a large proportion of patients (68.3%) cause of CGN was not known. Most of the patients were in CKD stage 5 (27%), and stage 5D (55.8%). Coronary artery disease (CAD) (in 7% patients), heart failure (in 2.7%) and stroke (in 2.2%) were the most common comorbidities. Anemia was prevalent in CKD from stage 3 onwards, the severity increased with increasing stage (p <0.001). Hemodialysis was the predominant mode of renal replacement therapy (RRT) used by 98.2% of CKD 5D patients. Conclusion: Nepalese patients of CKD are younger; males are more affected than females. CGN, diabetes and hypertension are three most common causes of CKD; IgA nephropathy is the most common cause of biopsy proven CGN leading to CKD. Anemia is common from CKD stage 3 onwards. The most common associated co-morbidity is CAD.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/879/788,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

With a view to analyze the distribution pattern of the Cinnamomum tamala spp., this study utilized the data obtained from the phyto-sociological survey of natural vegetation carried out in Mijure Danda Village Development Committee during June and July of 2009. Nested quadrats of 10m×10m, 5m×5m, and 1m×1m were used to collect the data from tree, sapling, and seedling, respectively. Dispersion indices: variance to mean ratio (I), index of Morisita (Iä), coefficient of Green (Cx), and the k exponent of negative binomial distribution were used to identify the distribution pattern of the species. Test of significance of I, and Iäprovided the information on rejection of null hypothesis: C. tamala does not follow the random distribution. The K exponent of negative binomial distribution suggests moderate contiguous pattern, which is in line with the previous studies of vegetation elsewhere.

The government has been spending a significant portion of its budget on imports, and it aims to reduce this dependence by increasing domestic production and achieving food security goals. To understand the dynamics of this issue, system dynamics modelling steps were employed. The key variables considered in the model testing were domestic production, imports, per capita consumption, productivity per hectare, and average area expansion rate. The study utilized time series data from 1991 to 2020 and projected the analysis up to 2050 using Stella Architect, a computer-based software program. The findings reveal that both the population and imports have exhibited exponential growth over the years. The model also indicates goal-seeking behaviour, with the government setting targets for yield increment based on available harvest areas. However, the policies implemented thus far have mostly been quick-fix approaches focusing input subsidized programs. According to the model, an increase of 70-100% in rice production will be required by 2050 to meet the growing population's demand. The study presents three policy options for achieving rice self-sufficiency: 1) a 2% annual increase in average area expansion, 2) raising productivity from 3700 kg ha-1 to 5000 kg ha-1 and 3) increasing productivity to 3900 kg ha-1 while reducing per capita rice consumption from 200 kg to 130 kg. The study suggests that adopting the recommended policy implications can help increase rice production in Nepal. Decision-makers should adopt a dynamic approach to the rice production system to address the issue of slow growth and achieve national self-sufficiency and food security goals.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/62168/46954,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

They frequently encounter with wildlife and get injured; sometimes they are killed. Similarly, wildlife cross the park boundary and destroy the crops and kill the livestock. Villagers also get their shelters and sheds damaged by them. BNP, therefore, has introduced various programmes to keep the conservation intact without disturbing the livelihood of Buffer Zone people. Several efforts, such as construction of Trench, Machan etc. have been made to address the issues associated with park people conflicts.

Furthermore, household expenditure on LPG decreases by 4.43 percent relative to cooking fuel expenses particularly for firewood by the households experiencing natural shocks. This reduction highlights a decline in the intensity of clean energy use among households concurrently using LPG and firewood. These results underscore the negative effects of natural shocks on the transition to clean cooking fuels posing challenges to achieving sustainable adoption of clean energy solutions.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/73397/56676,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

A feasible generalized least square technique is employed to calculate the vulnerability score, further disaggregated between rural-urban areas, provinces, and major caste/ethnic groups. The findings reveal that thirty-two percent of households are highly vulnerable, indicating that they have higher chances of falling below the poverty line due to death, illness, unemployment, and other household-specific shocks. The paper also finds that Karnali and Sudur Paschim Provinces have higher vulnerability than other provinces. Likewise, Dalits and Muslims have higher vulnerability scores compared to other castes / ethnic groups. The estimation suggests that the poverty incidence and vulnerability scores largely overlap, yet the vulnerability scores are consistently higher among all groups indicating a high risk of households falling into poverty. Therefore, it is desirable that major groups’ vulnerability profile, in addition to poverty profile, should be constructed and aligns the pro-poor policies to the vulnerable groups to mitigate the risks of pushing such vulnerable households below the poverty line.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/48035/35995,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

However, the production and publication of quarterly GDP for public consumption have been both rare and occasional. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing an estimate for quarterly GDP for the period of 1997/98 Q1 to 2017/18 Q4 following well established Chow-Lin procedure. The quarterly exports and government tax revenue are used to extrapolate the magnitude and movement of quarterly GDP. The results show a deterministic seasonal movement over the quarters. In particular, increased economic activities are observed in the second and fourth quarters while making a comparison on quarter to quarter basis. It is expected that this paper will partially fulfill the gap of unavailability of quarterly GDP figures in the public domain, and documents that the researcher may use suitable econometric exercise to obtain inter-temporal disaggregation of low-frequency data such as annual GDP into quarterly figures.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/36036/28143,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The medico legal investigation system in our country still lags far behind the developed countries. The doctors doing the medico legal and post-mortem work at the district level hospitals are often untrained in this sensitive job. It is a job of great responsibility and to leave it to inexperienced doctors is actually doing injustice to the society. Forensic experts handle a very small part of total medico-legal work as most of them work in private medical colleges which are not permitted to handle the work. Mortuaries are housed in outdated facilities. Exposure to the medical students on medico legal cases including autopsy is done only on a sporadic basis taking them to nearby government hospitals and even if they visit the hospitals, inadequate infrastructure prevents better learning. Private medical colleges are conducting postgraduate course in forensic medicine without handling medico legal cases. There should be a post of forensic medicine specialist, at least at the zonal hospitals and the district hospitals handling more medico legal cases. The private medical colleges, especially those enrolling postgraduate students in the field, must seek permission to conduct medico legal works and the government also should not be reluctant in permitting so as it’s not producing adequate experts in itself as per the need of the country.

It may include the use of threat or force. In some cases, the person cannot give consent to sex because he/she is unconscious or otherwise incapacitated. A person may be raped by a stranger, an acquaintance or date or a family member.Methods: The study was a retrospective and descriptive analysis of cases of sexual assault victims examined by the author in the Forensic Medicine departments at Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj and Gandaki Medical College Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal over a period of four years (2012 to 2016). This includes information regarding the age group of the victim at the time of sexual abuse, relationship of the victim to the perpetrator, genital and extra-genital injuries present over the victim’s body and number of cases attended as an expert witness by the author in various courts of Nepal.Results: In the four years period, a total number of 55 cases were examined as sexual assault cases. It was observed that majority were of the 13 - 15 years of age group (46%) followed by <10 years (20%), 16 - 20 years (16%), >20 years (11%) and 10 - 12 years (7%). Regarding the relationship of the victim to the alleged perpetrator, 87% cases (48 out of 55) were related to acquaintances compared to 13% due to strangers. Surprisingly, 3.6% cases (2 out of 48) were due to the biological fathers of the victims. On physical examination of the victim’s body, 36% cases showed genital injuries compared to only 15% with extra genital injuries. The author attended the court as an expert witness in 33% of these cases. Only 7% of the cases were mentally challenged.Conclusion: Young adults remain the most vulnerable group, so education related to sex, morality, humanity and different life skills training should be provided to these groups from their school years itself. The benefits of early intervention and comprehensive care of survivors with the use of standardized protocols along with shorter and lesser traumatic period of court processing to the survivors of these cases should be encouraged.Journal of Gandaki Medical College Volume, 09, Number 2, July December  2016, Page: 43-46",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/17865/14496,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

It is the only alternative to landfilling and open disposal; however, the current waste management system does not acknowledge informal recyclers aggravating various challenges and vulnerabilities that the sector already faces. This study identifies and validates for the first time the challenges of the informal waste sector while providing a granular understanding of the actors that shape waste management in the region. The study uses primary data collected over a period of 6 months in Kathmandu and Lalitpur, the first and third most populated areas in Nepal. The methods considered were semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and a co-creation workshop with formal and informal actors. A novel characterization of waste management actors was conducted to identify two profiles namely cyclists and scavengers and question the formality of the collection centres. Findings suggest that the price volatility of recycled materials and the lack of treatment and absence of regulatory capacity are among the main challenges in promoting a circular economy from the informal sector. The recommendations to overcome these challenges are a series of policy reforms, such as an extended responsibility producer scheme and the review of the tax on recycled material transport. The main policy implication from the finding reveals that circular economy is already being promoted by the informal sector — a responsibility that should fall under the remit of the regional and national governments. The study concludes that integration is not only necessary to improve the conditions of informal workers but essential to developing a circular economy in Nepal.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43615-023-00283-0.pdf,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Methods and material: Data were collected through telephone interviews with six representatives of community-based organizations and nine healthcare providers, and the collation of information about COVID-19 from social media, news outlets and government announcements. Data were thematically coded and analyzed according to the themes. Results: Although rapid dissemination of educational information through various social media was found, people reported an information overload on COVID-19 while questioning the authenticity of their sources. Several misbeliefs on the COVID-19 virus are rooted in the Nepalese community. Lockdown for a longer period was deemed an unsustainable preventive measure that directly impacted the income source of daily-wage workers. The fear of contracting coronavirus among healthcare providers at their workplaces was further triggered by the poor working conditions and non-availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). In fighting the pandemic, screening and management of other health issues were ignored. Conclusion: The prevention measures against COVID-19 are important for the local context, however, the communities need access of basic commodities and access to reliable information to enable them to follow these measures.

They play a vital role in daily life purposes to big engineering constructions such as dams, reservoirs or hydropower projects. It is mandatory to understand the morphology and dynamics of the river before initiating any projects for easier planning and to prevent possible damage to structures. The Malekhu Khola area is one of the potential areas for urbanization and has already been undergoing development of settlement and other infrastructures. This paper describes the morphology and dynamics of the Malekhu Khola to classify and characterize the river's behavior and competency. The Malekhu Khola is a sixth-order river having its total length of 24.83 km, watershed area of 101.28 km2 and the average gradient of 0.041 m/m. Various morphological parameters were measured with the aid of topographic maps, aerial photographs and Geographic Information System (GIS). The hydraulic parameters, channel sediment and slopes were measured at 10 different transects sites through field surveys. The river was classified using the Rosgen's Level II criteria. The river reaches have been classified as A4-, B4- and C4-type streams. A4- and B4-type streams are moderate-gradient gravelly and low sinuosity rivers whereas C4-type streams are low-gradient gravelly meandering river. The Malekhu Khola gradually changes from A4- to B4-type streams up to 12 km downstream, and then to C4-type stream further downstream, but B4-type streams reappear within the distance of 15 km to 19 km from the origin. This study presents temporal changes in river channel, and flow competence and aggrading/degrading potential evaluation of the Malekhu Khola.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/22873/19438,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

There can exist a considerable difference in the position between local and the global system and the difference could be of several hundred meters.  Based on the availability of data three sets of transformation parameters has been determined. The tests have been carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the transformation parameter in this region. The transformation parameter is recommended to transform the topographical data base of scale 1: 3500 and smaller.

The only way of mitigating these planetary and social crises is to formulate and strictly enact ecofriendly, resource recycling, circular economic, equitable, decentralized and peoples´ participatory developmental policies and practices. The objective of this review is to contribute to the discourse on transformative agriculture-centred, circular economic policies and practices that foster nature-based solutions and prudent extraction, use, re-use, and recycling of resources while minimizing waste and environmental externalities. The review highlights Nepal’s geophysical, agroecological and socioeconomic realities, their manifestations and policy implications. It also explores how past development policies have been mismatched with these realities, eroding the indigenous resource bases and knowledge systems, and thereby, disrupting the agriculture-based, self-reliant, and food sovereign livelihoods systems. The article argues that agroecology, as a science, practice and movement envisions a nature-based, circular economic and socially just transformative pathway towards sustainable agri-food systems embracing food sufficiency, safety and sovereignty. This pathway contributes to healthy people, healthy animals and healthy ecosystems, hence strengthening the vision of One Health. Building on the agroecological perspectives, this article presents the resynthesized eight operational elements referred to as “8-S-elements” for agroecological transformation. These elements pertain to the prudent management of space (S1), species (S2), seeds (S3), soils (S4), seasonality (S5) and stress factors (S6) through the synergistic integration of agroecosystems and livelihood systems components (S7) with socioeconomic rationality (S8). In the Nepalese context, as an agriculture-based economy, agri-food and livelihoods are viewed as complementary facets. This study recommends the transformative policy options based on the principles of ecological stewardship and socioeconomic objectivity.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The results indicate that, across the sampled countries, though respondents were highly concerned about the environment and resources utilization, their perception and understanding of CE principals and its applicability were limited to the concept of reuse, recycle and remanufacture (3R). Similarly, organizational involvement in CE activities were found to be significantly low in both countries, indicating no structural or operational level support such as creating job positions for CE officers. Additionally, the practice of publishing sustainability and circularity reports to enable the CE were not found during the data analysis procedure. In comparison to Nepal, USA respondents picked inter and intra organizational collaboration and cooperation along with research and development (R&D) as an important enabler of CE. Finally, policy level interventions through mandatory and voluntary regulations, subsidization of CE activities and involvement of governmental and non-governmental agencies were recommended in creating a positive perception and awareness of CE.

Attitude can be formed from a person’s past and present. This profession continues to grow and the attitude of the society toward it has been changing gradually. There have been a few studies on the attitude of the nurses toward their own profession in Nepal. The primary objective of this study is to compare the attitude of the nursing students and the practicing nurses toward nursing profession. Methods: A quantitative, prospective comparative cross sectional study design was adapted for this study. Nursing students studying proficiency certificate level (PCL)in a Nursing campus, and the practicing nurses working at a Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) in Kathmandu, Nepal were selected as study population. Attitude scale for nursing profession (ASNP) developed by Ipek- Coban and Kasikci in 2011 was adapted for the purpose of this study. Results: A total of 240 participants were selected for the study. One hundred and twenty were nursing students and 120 were practicing nurses. Only 0.8% of nursing students had negative attitude and all practicing nurses had positive attitude toward nursing profession. The t test {t(238)=-2.868, p=0.005} value of the comparative study denoted the attitude of the students and practicing nurses was different statistically. Conclusion: Contrary to previous beliefs, there is a strong positive attitude on nursing profession among both nursing students and practicing nurses, the attitude of the later reaching 100%. This should be considered by health care planner in formulating national policy to take a major step toward creating more scope for trained nurses which will in turn reduce brain drain.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/864/773,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The household survey was carried out in Kailash (hill) and Nayabasti (terai) of Chitwan. Descriptive analysis, mean comparison, correlations, and biodiversity indices were used for data analysis. On the basis of biodiversity index, evenness, the adequate number of species, and Sorenson’s coefficient, open-pollinated (OP) (nonhybrid) vegetables were more diverse in hills than in terai, while hybrid vegetables are more diverse in terai than in hills. Hybrid vegetables were mostly grown in terai, where the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides was also higher. OP vegetables dominated hilly areas. Gurung ethnic community had a significant role in the conservation of indigenous vegetable biodiversity. The primary source of seed was home storage in the case of OP vegetables in hills. However, in terai, agro-concerns were used as a significant source of seeds, followed by co-operatives. Co-operatives’ involvement was high in terai as compared to hills, but the role was not significant in vegetable farming. In contrast, assistance in vegetable farming from agriculture service provider organizations was higher in hills as compared to terai. The major problem in vegetable farming was lack of irrigation in both areas, followed by market inaccessibility in hills, whereas climate change was rising as a problem in terai. Markets of produced goods were farm gate, local markets, and distant markets. A middleman mostly did the price determination of the products. Off-season vegetable farming was not practiced in the study areas. However, off-farm vegetable production was typical in hilly areas. Indigenous and OP vegetable biodiversity has been facing various challenges despite their roles in nutrition, indigenous knowledge promotion, and food security. Hence, it is suggested to strengthen government policy toward irrigation facility development, gene bank establishment, marketing facilities, and technology transfer and develop on-farm community based intense organizations for sustainable vegetable diversity conservation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/29731/23899,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Bringing the time series trade data from reliable sources, this study also attempts to highlight import dependency ratio, correlation of population and GDP per capita growth with total import and pin down plausible reasons behind these pictures. The correlation study between import data to population growth and GDP per capita showed a positive correlation with r values 0.71 (p<0.05) and 0.99 (p<0.05), respectively. National supply sides when combine with domestic production mimics aggregate rice demands and these figures show increasing patterns accompanied by growing imports together with import dependency ratio. India alone dominates the rice trade which accounts for more than 90 percent of Nepal’s import in recent years. These noticeable surges in rice imports can be attributed to liberal trade policies of the respective trade partner countries, improvement in incomes, closer proximity, similar languages, and consumer preferences among others. Opening a domestic market for rice cannot be denied theoretically in favor of welfare-improving policy tools, however, it should be carefully considered to protect local farmer’s concerns. Though growth in rice productivity is encouraging over the recent previous years, there is ample potential to increase further by integrated programs combining expansion of spring paddy, inputs, irrigation, and technology. Moreover, attention should be paid toward consumer’s fine rice preferences aligning farmer’s motivations. The introduction of fiscal policy with application of tariff or non-tariff measures at least for a few years can encourage the domestic rice industry. Above policy adjustment can drive Nepal toward its rice self-reliant footing.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44796/33691,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Objective: To estimate cephalic index of healthy adult students of a medical university in eastern part of Nepal. Materials and Methods: This cross sectional study was carried on 292 adult students (158 male & 134 female) pursuing different courses at B.P. Koirala institute of Health sciences (BPKIHS), Dharan, Nepal. Head length and head breadth was measured for each student. All the measurements were taken by using standard measuring devices and applying standard anthropometric techniques. Results: The mean cephalic index for male was 75.82and for female was 78.36. The difference between male and female heads cephalic index was 2.54. Conclusion: Cephalic index of the female students is approximately 3.35 % higher than the male students in present study. This study may serve as basis of comparison for future studies and this data is expected to be of clinical, forensic and anthropological significance.",https://www.ijmhr.org/ijar.4.4/IJAR.2016.453.pdf,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Despite plethora of available literature on the topic, very few of them have focused the case of an underdeveloped nation and competition between two big nations in the disaster affected third nation. In this study, the disaster diplomacy involving Nepal, India and China has been analyzed using the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake and COVID-19 pandemic as the case studies. Similarly, the engagement of Nepal with India and China with respect to disaster management has been outlined and light has been shed in the scope and challenges of collaboration of Nepal with each of the nations. The findings show that both India and China, in the competition of global leadership, have been overtly or covertly attempting to extend their influence in Nepal and have utilized the disasters in Nepal as the opportunity to develop a positive image thorough humanitarian activities. While there are scopes such as friendly neighborhood, cultural proximity, investment in disaster resilient technology, there are also number of challenges such as political instability, lack of informal diplomacy and bureaucratic hurdles. The cooperation between Nepal, India and China is significant in reducing the impacts of disaster in all three nations.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

However, mainstreaming climate change issues into sectoral policies from the government can be seen as recent activities in Nepal. Nepal has contributed negligible amount of emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) of global greenhouse gas, it is the fourth most vulnerable country in the world. In this context, this paper aims to review climate change adaptation policies in terms of sectoral integration. This paper has adopted text-mining method for information retrieval and knowledge mining and followed step-by-step approach to undertake review of policies. It concludes that National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010 can be a milestone in sectoral adaptation of climate change issue largely because it has provided the national framework for sectoral adaptation to climate change. However, NAPA ignores the importance of structural and institutional reforms needed for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into sectoral agencies. Climate change Policy, 2011, Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) 2011, Constitution of Nepal, 2015, Local Government Operation Act (LGOA) 2017, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017 and National REDD+ Strategy, 2018 are other prominent legislative and policy frameworks that have significant contribution in sectoral integration of climate change adaptation issues. However, lack of climate change act in order to implement fully these policies into practice for its implementation can be a major obstacle to achieve the goal. In this context, strong legislative foundation with effective institutional mechanism among different sectors will be very crucial to capture the spirit of new Federal Constitution of Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23412/19841,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Institutional and Legislative Systems (ILS) approach has been adopted focusing on three aspects: i) legal and regulatory frameworks, ii) policies and programs, and iii) organizational/institutional set-up. This paper concludes that newly endorsed Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act (2017) can be a milestone in disaster management of Nepal not only because it has replaced about 40 years old Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 but also for the first time, it saw disaster risk management as an process focusing on different stages of disaster management cycles, preparedness, response and rehabilitation and mitigation. The provision of well-structured functional institutional set-up from the centre to local level can have positive outcome in disaster management. However, it overlooks significant aspect, such as the declaration of disaster-prone zones limiting the right of provincial disaster management committee only for recommendation to the Government of Nepal. Most of policies, strategies and legislations focused on some specific disasters such as flood, landslide, earthquake and GLOF/avalanches at national level paying less emphasis to the local level. Even now, most of the policy interventions towards different cycles of disaster risk management have laid emphasis on preparedness and response rather than to rehabilitation and mitigation. The conflicting provisions in Acts such as Water Resource Act (1992) and Building Act (1998) with Local Government Operation Act (2017) have made overlapping of their roles and responsibilities. So, the policy formulation and institutional set-up needs to be complemented by the ability and competence to operationalize the intent of the relevant acts and policies at all levels of government.The Geographical Journal of NepalVol. 11: 1-24, 2018 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/19546/16004,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The analysis shows that money supply and remittances have a favorable impact on the stock market, whereas interest rates and exchange rates have a negative impact on the performance of the stock market. There isn’t agreement, though, on how each macroeconomic factor affects stock market performance because there is a wealth of literature both supporting and refuting these findings.

So, the study has attempted to analyze the market of carnation cut flower in Kathmandu Valley. Data were collected from sample of carnation producers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers of the Kathmandu Valley. Simple random sampling technique was employed to select the respondents. Information from the respondents was generated through semi-structured interview schedule. Key informants were also interviewed for in-depth and related information. Data collected through personal interview and secondary sources was analyzed by applying descriptive statistical tools. Data analysis focused mainly on the market structure, conduct of marketing agents, and performance of carnation cut flower in the market in terms of returns to the marketing agents, present problems in marketing, and future prospects of carnation in Kathmandu Valley. Findings reveal that the market structure was well integrated and the conduct of the marketing actors was so far competitive to the large extent. The performance of the carnation cut flower in terms of price and profit seems satisfactory and sustainable. However, there were ample areas of improvements in the marketing system. Given the high degree of demand in the valley and increasing trend of imports of carnation cut flowers from other districts of the country as well as from foreign countries, concerted efforts must be made to reverse the situation and make the Valley self-reliant in fulfilling its demand alongside exporting to other districts and countries in the future.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/48025/35989,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Despite recognition of adaption in response to multiple changes in sustainable livelihood and critical climate change literature, risks attributed to biophysical effects of climate change have increasingly assumed importance. Consequently, diversification is promoted as an adaptive approach to reduce such risks. However, understanding livelihood adaptation from the vantage point of climate change alone might lead to a limited understanding of non-climatic factors also shaping it. This paper proposes understanding adaptation through analysing long-term livelihood changes and using society rather than climate change as a conceptual starting point. It argues that such an approach has better potential to highlight a broader range of dynamic drivers operating over decades and to inform contextually grounded rural livelihood adaptation policies. Changes are traced in the overall livelihood trajectories among four rural communities in Nepal, in living memory, to understand the role of adaptation in shaping it. Qualitative life narratives were collected and complemented by key informant interviews, field observations and the analysis of official documents. The findings suggest that livelihoods have shifted not only from subsistence towards income generation but also from engagement in diverse livelihood sectors towards specialisation; the opposite of the advocated diversification. The role of political, economic, social and cultural processes within and outside the community has been prominent in shaping this trajectory.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23416/19845,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Regression equation is estimated to find factors influencing on output and factors affecting TFPG. Extended Cobb-Douglas production function is examined to find TFPG. As it is disclosed by efficiencies measures such as labor productivity, capital productivity and material efficiency, there is not coherent relation among efficiency measures and output rather than in few cases. It implies that  output increase due to many reasons such as protection, internal demand, availability of material input, comparative advantage and so on. As it is evident by the regression result; output is mainly interrelated with the inherent components like labour, capital and material input though road is also notices as positive factor.

The catchment lies in the Siwalik Hills composing the Siwalik Group of rocks of Middle Miocene to Early Pleistocene age. Owing to the week and fragile geology, the Siwalik Hills are prone to the gully erosion, shallow landslide and debris flow, during the heavy rain storms in monsoon seasons. In the present study, landslide susceptibility assessment was carried out using two methods, rapid field-based assessment and statistical index methods. For the susceptibility mapping of the river bank slopes, field- based method was used. The seven parameters such as slope angle, slope material, reduction to groundwater, effect of drainage, effect of past failure, effect of vegetation cover and effect of land use were used to calculate the factor of safety in the field. The slope areas were classified as highly susceptible (FS<0.7), susceptible (0.7<FS<1), marginally stable (1<FS<1.2) and stable (FS>1.2) categories, and finally, a susceptibility map was prepared. For the total 4.179 sq. km area where rapid field-based assessment was carried out, the areas covered by highly susceptible, susceptible, marginally stable and stable zones are respectively, 21.56%, 22.11%, 17.37% and 38.95%. Among the highly susceptible and susceptible zones identified, 71% sites have experienced recent slope failures. Landslide susceptibility mapping of the whole catchment area was prepared using statistical index method, and considering seven causative parameters such as elevation, slope, slope aspect, curvature, river proximity, stream density and lithology, which were determined and prepared from DEM using Arc GIS. Eighty percent landslides were used as the training sample for the spatial analysis, whereas 20% landslides were used for the validation of the study.

The construction industry for Roads and Bridges in Nepal is in a transitional phase and the working procedures varies on the individual capacity of each contractor. So, a practical approach is necessary for developing a methodology for estimation of duration. At present the estimated contract duration lacks uniformity among the projects of similar size and nature. With time extension issue getting much attention in recent amendments of PPR, estimation of duration has yet in the shadows among the lawmakers. This research aims at developing an empirical formulae for determination of contract duration based on the historical data of roads and bridges completed within the last five years. A total of 83 bridges and 78 road projects were analyzed. Regression analysis was carried out for developing a mathematical relation between time and cost of the project. The data was made to fit in Browmillow’s time-cost model. Apart from the cost of the project, there are other factors that affect the duration of the project. To address these project specific requirements, modification were recommended to the time-cost model by introducing coefficients in the empirical relation. As per the obtained equation, contract duration is directly proportional to the cost. However, the rate of increase in contract duration decreases with increase in cost. The reason for this is due to the higher level of parallel activities and better use of technologies for the contracts with higher cost. This model can be useful for government agencies, contractors and consultants involved in construction and procurement of roads and bridges in Nepal. The empirical formula obtained as an outcome of this research is applicable for roads and bridge projects of Nepal with estimated amount greater than two crore.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/njce/article/download/43372/32856,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

This study aims to look for incidence of neonatal respiratory distress in our setup, to analyze the common causes of respiratory distress and to determine possible strategic plan needed for better clinical outcome.Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted from March 2013 to December 2014 in Nepal Medical College and Teaching Hospital. Data of all the neonates with respiratory distress admitted during this period were analyzed.Results: Total 317 (13.4%) neonates were admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during the study period.109 neonates developed respiratory distress comprising 34.3% of all Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admissions. Incidence of neonatal respiratory distress was 4.6%. The common causes of respiratory distress in our study were meconium aspiration syndrome in 21.1%, septicemia in 16.5%, transient tachypnea of newborn in 15.5%, pneumonia in 14.6%, birth asphyxia and hyaline membrane disease were in each 11.9% of the neonates. Caesarean section was the most common predisposing factor associated with the development of transient tachypnea of newborn in 82.3% newborns (p=.001). The overall mortality rate due to respiratory distress was 12.8%.Conclusions: Meconium aspiration syndrome, septicemia and hyaline membrane disease are the most important causes of respiratory distress in our setup. Good obstetric care, proper training of health care personnel in neonatal resuscitation and early recognition of potential risk factors of respiratory distress will be helpful. ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNHRC/article/download/20297/16826,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Many hill villages are situated on or adjacent to unstable slopes and old landslides are reactivated from time to time. The rapidly increasing construction of infrastructure, such as roads, irrigation canals, and dams without due consideration of natural hazards is contributing to triggering of landslides and debris flows. Thus, this paper has explored the cause and characteristics of landslides occurrences and their mitigation practices in Nepal. Topographic, geologic and triggering factors, and human intervention causing landslides are characterised to suggest the suitable mitigation options that can be implemented in the mountain hill-slopes. Among the wide range of slope stabilisation measures which are available to practitioner engineer, the lowering of groundwater level in combination of controlling of surface infiltration (e.g. sealing of tension cracks) of water into landslide are the most cost effective options for mountainous terrain because the rise in pore water pressure is one of the basic cause of landslides during the rainy season. In addition, removing of unstable slope debris, surface drainage, and retaining walls are the useful landslide mitigation measures depending on site conditions, availability of budget, and specific requirements. Various support systems and elements can be crafted for creative solutions of the slope instability problems in Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/23138/19639,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Hepatitis B infection is a global public health problem; its prevalence is ubiquitous and heterogeneous.This article reviews the situation and an impact of hepatitis B infection in the indigenous people in Nepal through the lens of equity perspective.Methods: Literature search and collection of information from different sources.Results: Hepatitis B prevalence is low (0.9%) at the country level in Nepal but higher, up to 38%, among the indigenous population compared to the national prevalence. Those who live in the high endemic areas are at risk of getting the infection from both vertical and horizontal mode of transmission. The unvaccinated cohort of infant (0-11 months) between 2003 and 2016 has swollen, 2764362 in number or 29 % of the total cohort. The National Immunization Program (NIP) administered hepatitis B vaccination at 6 weeks of birth, considering the low prevalence at the national level. The NIP does not prevent perinatal transmission of the infection. The mother to child transmission of the infection often leads to chronic liver diseases and about 20–30% of adults who are chronically infected will develop cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. The indigenous populations are thus disproportionately affected by the infection.Conclusions: The policy update is required to implement the hepatitis B vaccination at birth or within 24 hours in high endemic setting along with a comprehensive package to reduce the disparity, prevent the transmission, risk of chronic infection and its sequelae to achieve the national goal and international commitment on the sustainable development goal by 2030.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJOG/article/download/21608/17763,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

This disease is most common in rural areas of low income countries. It is difficult to differentiate clinically from other tropical infections such as malaria, dengue, enteric fever and leptospirosis. Hence the study aim was to determine the seroprevalence of scrub typhus among the acute febrile illness patients attending in different hospitals of Chitwan district. Methods: The study was based on patients with suspected scrub typhus cases in Chitwan district from March 2017 to August 2017. Blood samples were collected from the suspected patients of scrub typhus, having acute febrile illness. IgM antibody to Orientia tsusugamushi was detected by using Scrub Typhus Detect™ Kit, In Bios International, USA. Results: A total of 451 samples, 112 (24.80%) were positive for IgM Antibodies. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the following factors were significantly associated with the scrub typhus. 1.

In a severe power and energy crisis situation in the country, power export is not recommended. Nepal needs 3000 MW to reach the level of other south Asian nations. INPS is owned and operated by NEA; therefore NEA also has the responsibility to prepare master plan for power generation, transmission and distribution. But, the Department Electricity Development a regulatory body of Ministry of Energy of is undertaking / carrying out feasibility study without taking care of INPS/country’s power requirement. This has created duplication of work and confusion; as such the Ministry of Energy deviated from its responsibility of preparing sound policy, regulation and monitoring them strictly.

Gini coefficient was used as analytical tool. As the results, 67 percent households are absolute poor and 23 percent households are relatively poor. The poor households excessively and directly dependent on the forest products of the community forests for their daily livelihood objectives. This study found that community forests contributed 45 percent livelihood income (firewood, leaf litter, and grass, water etc.) to the forest-dependent households, along with service and agriculture income sources. Labor contribution based proportional distribution was used to meet social and economic justice. The poor could get more benefit than the well-off households. Additionally, the study found declining inequality among households after being a member of KCF. Without the income of the community forests, the inequality was 0.99. With the income of the community forests, the inequality sharply dropped at 0.64.

Remittances are considered to be the most significant source of foreign currency that makes strong position of balance of payments, whereas the volume of imports is one of the most significant elements that lowers the volume of foreign currency reserve of the nation. It is generally believed that remittances have positive effects on volume of imports. On the contrary, if there is more imports than exports, it may run out trade deficit. It does make negative impact on the exchange rate of the home country. A weaker currency can raise the value of remittances sent back to the country, encouraging migrants to send more money home that influenced in growth of remittance. To analyze the relationship between remittance and imports, the study used annual data for 46 years from 1975 to 2020 A.D. The study used Vector Autoregressive model as there is no co-integration between the variables as per Johansen's technique. The variance decomposition test is carried out in a similar manner. The results demonstrate that there is a close connection between remittances and imports.

With the increasing need to reduce healthcare costs in developing countries, there is currently a trend towards performing tonsillectomy on a daycare basis and this study aims at evaluating how efficacious it may be in our setting. Methods: A retrospective review of all the daycare tonsillectomy surgeries performed at the Pokhara ENT Center, Pokhara, Nepal from February 2018 to January 2019. Patients aged 15 years and up of either sex who met the paradise criteria were included while patients who met the same but had a contraindication for tonsillectomy surgery were excluded. Demographic information as well as complications within six hours of surgery before discharge and on follow-up on the seventh post-operative day were evaluated, as were any emergency room visits in the first 24 hours and any complications requiring a visit to a healthcare facility. Results: On day of surgery 17% had worst pain and on seventh post-operative day 75% had no pain, only 2% presented with primary hemorrhage and 3% presented with secondary hemorrhage. None of them required revision surgery. Conclusions: Daycare tonsillectomy is being done in only some of the centers owing to the risk of postoperative complications in our country.

This study is based on a detailed study of 32 sampled sites out of a total of 275 sites identified in Pokhara metropolitan city, and interviews with key informants in the concerned sites. The results show that there is no uniform trend in the change of open space. The area has remained constant in some sites whereas it has been decreased in some sites and also increased in some sites. Out of the total, 56.25 percent of patches remained constant in terms of area whereas 40.13 percent patches are decreased and increased in only 3.12 percent patches during the period between 1998 to 2018. There has been a net decrease of 24.652 hectors in the area in total. The increase of 3.12 percent attributed mainly to land pooling from individual ownership whereas the decrease is mainly due to the encroachment by individual people as well as for the construction of public infrastructure especially for expansion of the roads.

Earthquakes in Nepal have been reported since 1255 while major earthquakes were recorded in 1408, 1681, 1810, 1833, and 1866, 1934, 1980, 1988, 2011, and 2015. An earthquake in September 18, 2011 measuring 6.9 in Richter scale, killed 6 people and injured 30 people in Nepal. There were many roadside slope damages near the epicenter area. To assess the roadside slope damages after this earthquake, a field visit was conducted and a landslide inventory map along the roadside slope was prepared for most damaged area. This paper provides a comprehensive information about earthquake-induced slope failures occurred in the Mechi Highway of eastern Nepal and also discusses an approach of earthquake-induced slope failures hazard mapping in Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/23141/19642,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The proportions of lead oxide affected the sensitivity of the electrode. The electrode composed of 50% lead oxide and 50% graphite gave reproducible result and behaved in Nernstian manner with a potential gradient of -58.8±0.3 mV per unit change in pH. Metal ions such as iron (II), iron (III) and lead (II) interfered in the measurement of pH, while silver (I), copper (II), oxidizing agents such as dichromate and permanganate do not interfere. In absence of interfering ion, the lead oxide-graphite composite electrode could be used for the measurement of pH from 2 to 11. This electrode can also be used as an indicator electrode for acid base titrations. Low cost, quick response, easy to fabricate are some of the advantages of the lead oxide-graphite composite electrode.

Pressure necrosis by the inflated balloon is the commonest culprit. Post-intubation tracheal stenosis is a major indication for tracheal resection and anastomosis. This study was done to find out the indications and results of surgery for post-intubation tracheal lesions. Methods: It was a descriptive observational study of patients with post- intubation tracheal lesions managed in Manmohan Cardiothoracic Vascular and Transplant Center over a period of 20 years (2001 to 2021). Results: Twenty-five patients were treated for post-intubation tracheal lesions. Four had isolated tracheo-esophageal fistula (TEF); eighteen had an isolated tracheal stenosis and three had both. Most had a tracheal resection and end-end anastomosis (REEA) via a cervical approach, resecting an average of 2.7 cm of tracheal length. The average size of stenotic lumen was 4.32 mm. There were no operative deaths. Two patients expired within a month of surgery: one due to fatal restenosis and the other due to sepsis. There were a few immediate and a few long-term complications. The average follow-up period was 5 years. Conclusion: Among the various post-intubation lesions, tracheal stenosis is the commonest indications for surgery.

Employees Provident Fund, Citizen Investment Trust, and Social Security Funds are three major competing institutions in the social security market in Nepal. This paper explores the investment of funds accumulated through the contribution of employees for value creation as a means to enhance financial viability and further assesses the long-term sustainability of such programmes. The study is based on reviewing and analyzing the documents relating to the defined objectives and targets, investment policies, investment portfolio, legal framework for investment, and achievements. The study finds that all three social security institutions (SSIs) end up investing the accumulated funds in fixed deposits in the banking and financial institutions (BFIs.). This is despite the act empowering them to mobilize the accumulated funds in several productive sectors and set competitive investment goals. This indicates that they fail to explore productive avenues for sustainable investment of the accumulated funds, which could contribute to the economic development of the nation. The current challenges in the social security system in Nepal are the increasing number of pensioners and the need for sustainable investment; making it imperative for the Nepalese SSIs to evaluate their investment priority; feasibility and diversify for higher and long-term returns; focusing on areas that contribute to economic growth and development; and generating employment opportunities.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/68022/52144,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

While substantial hydro investments are in the pipeline; a strong, diverse hydro-mechanical manufacturing industry is established. But the electro-mechanical industry is non-existent. Policies have attracted substantial private investment in hydropower sector, but it is not geared towards the use of electricity for overall economic development of Nepal and has yet to streamline policy with respect to lean season augmented flow of water for drinking and irrigation purposes within and outside Nepal.

This study is concerned with agricultural land abandonment and its impact on soil erosion in the Madi Watershed, Gandaki Province of Nepal. This study used high-resolution aerial photography and Google Earth images to map cultivated land and its abandonment in 1995 and 2020. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model has been used to estimate soil erosion. Studies revealed that more than 40% of the agricultural land was abandoned from 1995 to 2020 and there is higher spatial variability of abandonment intensity. High altitude and steeper slope areas have a higher intensity of abandonment than in lower altitude and lower slope gradients. There is a significant impact of abandonment of agricultural land on reducing soil erosion from 1995 to 2020. The average rate of soil erosion was quite high in 1995 but decreased to 51.5 percent in 2020. There are higher rates of reduction in soil erosion at higher altitudes and marginal lands like steeper slopes and the areas having lower solar radiation because of the higher proportion of agricultural land abandonment. Thus, it can be concluded that agricultural land abandonment during the last 25 years significantly impacts soil erosion control in the study area.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/63935/48383,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Knowing the employment elasticities to various tourism indicators helps to understand the tourism sector and make sound policy inferences. For this purpose, the paper combined the annual data from the WorldTravel and Tourism Council (WTTC) on direct and indirect contribution to employment and GDP with the total tourist arrival and the average length of stay data from Nepal Tourism Statistics to estimate a simple double log-linear equation-based individual elasticity coefficients. The findings of this paper suggest that besides government personal travel and tourism spending, other all elasticities are positive. Among them, the average length of stay has the most substantial and positive employment elasticity coefficient, which is relatively higher than the total number of arrival elasticity too. Thus, it is better to target to extend the length of stay than the arrival of tourist, other things remaining the same",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/35926/28086,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The number of COVID-19 cases has been gradually increasing in Nepal. The objective of this study was to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practice regarding COVID-19 among healthcare workers in Chitwan, one of the districts located in central Nepal. Methods It was a cross-sectional study conducted among healthcare workers from various health institutions located in Chitwan district of Nepal. A self-reported questionnaire was circulated online. Bivariate analyses were done using Spearman’s correlation coefficient, Pearson’s chi square test, and student’s t test as appropriate, whereas multivariate analyses were done using linear regression models. Results A total of 353 responses were analyzed, out of which 47% were nurses, 28.9% were doctors, 11.6% were health assistants, 2% were certified medical assistants, and the remaining 10.5% were categorized as others. The majorities were females (58.9%), were in the age group of 16–29 years (67.1%) and had work experience of less than 5 years (62%). The majority of healthcare workers obtained good to moderate knowledge and practice scores (n = 82.15%, 83.57%, respectively) and had positive attitude scores (n = 90.93%). Mean score values were 21.65 ± 4.71 out of 33 in knowledge section, 8.07 ± 1.49 out of 13 in attitude section and 13.89 ± 5.33 out of 20 in practice section. Mean knowledge and practice scores were significantly associated with job descriptions of healthcare workers (p value – 0.000, 0.007, respectively) with highest mean knowledge scores among doctors (23.70 ± 4.48) and highest mean practice scores among health assistants (15.10 ± 3.61). Higher practice scores (ß = 0.626) and infection prevention training (ß = 1.467) were significantly associated with higher knowledge scores; higher knowledge (ß = 1.366) and higher practice scores (ß = 0.110) were significantly associated with higher attitude scores; and higher knowledge scores (ß = 0.308) and higher attitude scores (ß = 0.265) were significantly associated with higher practice scores. Conclusion The majority of healthcare workers from Chitwan, Nepal, had good to moderate knowledge and practice scores and had a positive attitude toward COVID-19.

The adoption of rain water harvesting was mostly driven by trainings that farmers received while controlling for age, poverty status and off-farm income. The adoption of RWH technology more than doubles household agricultural and livestock income. Instrumental variable approach was used to check the robustness of the findings. Adopters benefited from an increased supply of irrigation water, which allows them to diversify their crops from cereal production to high-value crops during dry season. Given the many weather-related uncertainties faced by rainfed farmers in Nepal, rain water harvesting is potentially a very useful climate adaptation strategy.

Some go readily for treatment, others only when in great pain and in advance state of ill health. This is especially true for people with advance age who have to face many physiological changes which act as a barrier to seek immediate help in health care setting. Thus, a study was conducted to analyse the health seeking behaviour among elderly. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 104 elderly aged 60 years and above. Non- probability convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data. Data was collected by interviewing the elderly at their residence. The data gathered was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics in SPSS software. Results: Assessment of the health status of elderly people revealed that, majority of the participant’s 86.5% were suffering from chronic health problem, among them 37.8% suffered from hypertension 11.1% suffered from diabetic mellitus. Whereas, assessment of the practice of health seeking behaviour among elderly stated that all the participant’s 100%  were seeking help for health problem in which 83.7% seek help from modern medication and still 16.3% seek help from alternative medication.  Also, the health seeking behavior was found to be statistically significant with health problem (p=0.002), ethnicity (0.007) and religion (p=0.007) respectively.

The lack of awareness is very evident in Nepal. In this study, we aimed to learn about the attitude of senior secondary level students towards mental illness. Material And Method: Descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted amongst senior secondary level students to investigate about their attitude towards mental illness. We recruited a sample of 138 students from classes 11 and 12 from a conveniently sampled school of Dharan Sub-metropolitan. Semi-structured questionnaire was used to elicit the information. Results: Our study group consisted of 53.6% females while 46.4% were males. Equal numbers of students were sampled from each grades with their ages ranging from 14-18 years. The mean for total of BMI scale was 52 and the standard deviation was observed to be 12.810. The T-tests revealed males had more negative attitude than the female students which was statistically significant with a p value of 0.048. Our study revealed that there was a significant negative correlation between the attitude scores and the grade the respondents were studying and also between the gender of the respondent, father’s and mother’s education level and in students having a family member or neighbor suffer from mental illness.

Its therapeutic benefits are restricted by several adverse drug reactions (ADR). Therefore, it is necessary to measure its serum concentration for optimal dosing and clinical response and to minimize toxicity. The objectives of the study were to correlate dose of Lithium with its serum concentration and serum concentration of lithium with clinical effect. Material And Method: A cross sectional study was conducted in 213 patients presenting to psychiatric OPD, diagnosed with BPAD and taking Lithium monotherapy at least for 3 months. Data collection was done from 15th December 2018 to14th December 2019. Sociodemographic profile and relevant laboratory investigations were recorded on a self-designed proforma. Young Mania Rating Scale and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were applied for objective assessment of remission. Chi square test was used to correlate categorical data and ANOVA test was used for continuous data using SPSS at P-value of 0.05. Results: Majority of patients were male (51.6%), married (62.4%), Hindu (86.9%) and in remission phase (92%). Dose of lithium was 300-1200 mg/day; serum concentration was 0.26 to 1.51mmol/L, was in therapeutic range in majority of the patients (82.6%) and was positively correlated with the dose of lithium (P-value <0.0001). Conclusion: Lithium is very effective for maintenance therapy in BPAD with wide variation in dose and serum concentration.

Information was obtained from EEG register and reports. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 23. Frequency distribution was studied and Chi Square test was applied for categorical variables. The only continuous variable studied was the age for which mean, median and standard deviation were computed and the suitable statistical tool was applied after normality testing.Result: Of the total 164 patients studied, mean age was 21.93 years and 51.2% were male. The common reason for EEG referral was to rule out seizure disorder (80.5%), requested mostly from the department of Psychiatry. EEG abnormality was seen in 43.3% with EEG diagnosis of generalized epilepsy in 26.21% and slow wave (46.2%) as the most common EEG finding. Abnormal EEG detection rate was almost similar in both the genders and predominant in those with a clinical diagnosis of seizure disorder (47.88%). The EEG abnormality detection rate was significant in those referred from the Department of Psychiatry and Paediatrics.Conclusion: EEG is a relatively inexpensive and non-invasive test for detection of electrical activity in the brain.

Understanding the genetic variability of MAP, strains are important in diagnosis, epidemiological investigation, and therefore the formation of strategies for prevention and control of the disease. Thus, this study was designed to grasp the molecular characterization of MAP isolates of Nepal, as pioneer research of this area. Total of 46 MAP isolates obtained from cattle population of three different locations of dairy pocket areas of Chitwan, Nepal were typed using IS1311 polymerase chain reaction-restriction endonuclease analysis (PCR-REA) to research the MAP genotype of Nepal. The extracted DNA samples (n=46) were analyzed for the presence of MAP specific sequences (IS900) using PCR and DNA samples were further subjected to genotype differentiation using IS1311 PCR-REA and IS1311 L2 PCR-REA methods. All the DNA samples were positive for the entire three MAP specific sequences based PCRs. This study revealed that ‘Bison type’ strain is the single most prevalent MAP genotype circulating within the domestic cattle population of Nepal. IS1311 PCR-REA showed that MAP DNA samples of Nepal origin belonged to ‘Bison type’, whereas, IS1311 L2 PCR-REA method showed similarity with ""Indian Bison type"" and different restriction profiles of ‘Bison type’ genotype as compared to non-Indian strains. The study concludes that in Nepal, ""Bison type"" MAP stains was prevalent in all the MAP samples obtained from dairy cattle.

We construct the marketwide indicators of Fama-French approach: capitalization (Small and Big) and book-to-market ratio (Low, Middle and High). The standard CAPM and three-factor regression equations are estimated. The typical Fama and French results are not obtained. At best, the results are mixed. They show that Nepalese capital market provides excess return for big value-stocks and lower excess return for small growth-stocks.

Remittances to Nepal rose dramatically in response to the earthquake by 20.9 percent in 2015 versus 3.2 percent in 2014. There is also a correlation between the level of remittance and hardship. The paper uses inflation as an indicator of ‘Financial Hardship’ to analyse the role of altruistic motives as a determinant of inflow of remittances. When prices of goods and services increase in the home country, the workers send more money to support their families. The Engel-Granger cointegration test is used to assess the short-run and the long-run relationship between inflation and remittances. Inflation does not affect remittances in the short run, however, there is the long-run relationship between remittances and inflation.

The possibility of Islamic finance functioning as a microfinance tool by involving those who do not engage in economic activity will also be explored in this study. This article also argues for the need to set aside theological differences in order to embrace Islamic financing for the upliftment of underprivileged Muslim and non-Muslim minorities. Islamic finance has several advantages that cannot be dismissed based solely on the name or the notion that it is only for Muslims. To assist underprivileged populations in escaping poverty, Nepal's economy requires a banking system that would operate for welfare rather than profit. The only means of helping those who are below the poverty line to increase their wage rate are interest-free loans and microfinance tools.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine the likelihood of workers continuing their participation in Nepal’s emerging gig platforms and to identify the determinants influencing labor supply across various gig sectors. Additionally, the research aims to explore key opportunities, challenges, and support measures necessary to enhance the well-being and sustainability of gig workers in Nepal. Methods: A binary logit regression model was employed to analyze survey-based primary data collected from 386 gig workers in the Kathmandu Valley. The research encompasses five key sectors: ride-sharing platforms, online tutoring services, e-commerce delivery platforms, food delivery services, and freelance work. To ensure statistical robustness, the study incorporated tests for correlation matrices, goodness of fit, multicollinearity, as well as sensitivity and specificity assessments. Results: Freelancing has the highest participation rate, but ride-sharing and e-commerce delivery reduce gig work continuation, with ride-sharing dominating. Employed individuals, driven by income, satisfaction, and household head status, are more likely to continue. Full-time work is common in ride-sharing and delivery, while part-time work is more frequent in freelancing and tutoring. Gig workers earn subsistence income, between 30-40k NPR, with income rising with age, education, transport costs, hours worked, and satisfaction. Conclusion: Nepalese gig workers face substantial challenges. Women are disproportionately under represented. Addressing legal and regulatory challenges, social and health issues, and financial insecurities, Nepal can leverage its gig economy to provide a resilient and inclusive alternative to traditional employment to resolve unemployment across diverse socioeconomic groups.

Most of our cancer patients present to the hospital quite late. In our everyday practice, we encounter many progressive incurable cancer patients who need palliative care. The goal of the palliative care is to relieve the pertinent symptoms or to improve quality of life (QoL) for patients with advanced cancer. We reviewed the palliative care services to the cancer patients at our center. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the cancer patients who received palliative care alone or in adjunct to curative treatment in Binayatara Cancer Center since its establishment in December 2018 was done. Results: A total of 108 patients received palliative care of which most were at advanced stage of disease (Stage IV). The male to female ratio was 1:1.45. The most common complaints for their visit was pain (62%) followed by nause and vomiting (32%), constipation (28%), anorexia (22%), shortness of breath, abdominal distension, seizure. Most of the patients with pain needed morphine (65%) for pain management followed by tramadol (25%) and NSAIDs (10%). Few of them were also supplemented with TCAs and anticonvulsants. Abdominal distension due to ascites was managed by ascitic tapping, Albumin supplementation while shortness of breath due to pleural effusion was managed by pleural fluid tapping. In one patient with pleural effusion, chest tube was inserted. Three patients with seizure due to brain metastasis were managed with anticonvulsant. A patient of prostate cancer with bony metastasis was managed with surgical orchidectomy. Conclusion: While considering the appropriate and effective use of palliative care, a palliative care physician is often confronted with a full range of multidisciplinary treatment options, and technical considerations that could potentially relieve some symptoms of advanced cancer in our settings.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/1096/1012,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Among them, the flood is one of the natural disasters and that occurred in the Narayani River basin. The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising. In order to effectively manage and prepare for potential flood hazards in the study area, an analysis of the flood risk assessment was conducted by taking into consideration three primary factors: the flood hazard map, flood exposure, and flood vulnerability. The layers of the population, crops, schools, hospitals, and road network were all exposed to flooding, and the factors that determined flood vulnerabilities were literacy, urban area, and agecomposition (less than 14 and more than 65). The higher flood risk area was found in Ward number 1, 3, 4,16,18,26 of Bharatpur metropolitan, Gaindakot municipality ward number 1 and 12, 15 of Madhyabindu Municipality.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-74923-1_822,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

However, the lack of sufficient study has created the possibility of unprecedented geohazards. In this study, a detailed geological and engineering geological mapping along with the geotechnical analysis of soils and sediments from the Bhainsepati–Pharsidol area of Lalitpur District has been carried out. Detailed geological maps and geological cross-sections were prepared on the scale of 1:25,000 following the most adopted stratigraphy of central Nepal for both hard rocks and Quaternary deposits. Two mappable geological units like the Tistung Formation and the Chandragiri Limestone of the Phulchauki Group are found within the hard rock succession at the study area’s hill sections. Similarly, the Quaternary succession is mapped into the Lukundol Formation and the Chapagaon Terrace deposits of Kathmandu Valley sediments from older to younger succession respectively. There is a distinct erosional unconformity between the rocks of the Phulchauki Group and the Quaternary Valley sediments. A kinematic analysis of discontinuities developed in the rocks was carried out in the rock slopes found in the area. Both field and laboratory analyses of soil samples were carried out for the representative samples. The laboratory tests include moisture content, specific gravity, particle size distribution, soil consistency, compaction, and consolidation properties. Finally, an engineering geological map was prepared on the same scale as geological mapping showing the details of the distribution of geo-materials.

About 56% of the households receive remittances, the country also has high rates of undernutrition as 36% of children under five years of age are stunted. Remittance are known to increase household income, potentially contributing to improvements in health and nutrition of children, but few studies have examined it in the Nepalese context. Methods: We used data of 2,498 children under 5 years of age from the Nepal Living Standard Survey 2010/11 to investigate associations between childhood stunting and household remittances. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of child stunting by remittances received by the families in the 12 months preceding the survey. Guided by a conceptual framework, the model was adjusted for variables representing child, maternal and household level characteristics. Results: Our investigation showed that the odds of a child being stunted decreased with increased levels of remittance received by households, 67% (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.67) lower for households receiving more than Nrs.60,000 remittance per year. However, there was no difference in the risk of stunting by gender of the household head and income categories.Conclusions: An increased household income could potentially reduce the burden of chronic undernutrition in poor families in Nepal, which in turn paves a path for the expansion of cash transfer programs.

A study was carried out in the summer (May/June) of 2019 to assess the adoption status of recommended production practices among rice-growing farmers of Janakpurdham-17 & 18 (Only two local bodies of Janakpurdham sub-metropolitan city under thematic working areas of Rice Zone, Prime Minister Agriculture Modernization Project of Nepal). The results analysis showed that most respondents were male (80%). Many respondents were in the adult age group (44%) followed by senior citizens (34%). Most of them were illiterate (68%), had a medium household size, and had a low level of income. The average landholding size was found to be 0.9546 ha. Many of the respondents were not affiliated with the farmers’ groups and did not receive any sort of training. Most respondents were found to be adopters of recommended rice production practices except for the recommended age of seedlings. The Chi-square test showed that farmer group membership and training had a positive and significant relationship with the adoption of recommended production practices. Also, the income of farmers was positively correlated with the adoption of irrigation sources. Major sources of knowledge about rice cultivation among the respondents were found to be neighbors, relatives, fairs and exhibitions, and non-governmental organizations. Lack of better irrigation facilities, poor seed quality, lack of agriculture loans, and disease, and insect pest problems were the major constraints faced by the farmers in rice cultivation.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

We applied Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis to see if the government's decision to end two nationwide lockdowns had an impact on the average daily new cases of COVID-19 reported in Nepal.   Method: ITS analysis on daily new cases of COVID-19 was performed for first and second nationwide lockdown on data of Nepal from data depository for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Impact of ''ending nationwide lockdown'' and possible associated factors were investigated. Result: The impact of removing first nationwide lockdown contributed to statistically significant rise of an average difference of 899 daily new cases due to community transmission of COVID-19. During second lockdown, even after imposing lockdown, cases overwhelmed existing healthcare system due to high infectivity of new Delta variant followed by a lack of adherence to public health measures and delayed decision to impose lockdown due to economic reasons. Whereas significant decline of cases was observed with an average difference of 2970 daily new cases after ending second nationwide lockdown mostly due to vaccine acceptance.   Conclusion: First lockdown was imposed early due to uncertainty about progression of disease, curative measures and unavailability of vaccines. Ending of first lockdown was done untimely due to economic reasons and festive seasons.  The unusual decline in cases after ending second lockdown could be contributed to increased vaccination in the country.  ",https://jgpemn.org.np/jgpemn/index.php/jgpemn/article/download/38/38,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

An elasticity indicator shows 1% of land conversion in Siwalik resulted in 0.47 % and 0.21 % changes in ESVs during the two periods, respectively. Overall findings of this study, suggest that ESV has increased in the Siwalik region of Madhesh province in the last two decades, primarily due to an increase in forest cover.

Nepal is at the risk of climatic hazards and being an agricultural country adopting agriculture insurance comes with lot of benefit to the farmers. The government is providing 80% subsidy in the insurance premium to link farmers with the insurance activities. Although insurance in agriculture was formally started in 2013 but the adoption of crop insurance is still low as compared to livestock insurance. Complex procedure and field monitoring for the valuation of insured amount in damaged crop is the reason for its low adoption. Nepal Insurance Authority is actively involved in increasing the number of farmers in agriculture insurance and it has allocated several ,nonlife insurance companies to open their branch in all the district of Nepal. This has increased the interest of farmers in agriculture insurance.

The present study attempts to assess the vulnerability of the community due to climate change for which Chiti area of Besisahar Municipality from Lamjung district of Nepal was selected as the study area. The climate change vulnerability was assessed using the Long Term Research Program (LTRP). The long term climate change vulnerability household surveys from 2014 baseline data to 2016, 2017 and 2019 data were analysed in this study. This study adapted IPCC (2001) methodology i.e. also used by C4 EcoSolutions on their baseline climate change vulnerability assessment. This is a bottom-up, integrative approach that considers both physical and social dimensions at a local level. Consequently, vulnerability is best understood as a function of three components: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Exposure to climate change vulnerability is calculated with sum of changes in temperature, changes in rainfall patterns, changes in rainfall intensity, drought episodes and flooding events. Sensitivity is calculated based on slope failures, soil fertility, changes in natural environment (i) soil cover; ii) levels of river sedimentation; iii) water salinity; iv) river ecosystems; v) forest size; and vi) the presence of invasive species), economic dependency level, irrigation facilities and livelihood sources. The major finding is that Chiti has been facing climate change since last decade and it is found severely vulnerable due to climate change. There is an urgent need of improvement on climate change adaptive capacity which could result of awareness, information on climate change and adaptation, surplus production and change in agricultural practices. The present study has used awareness score based on conceptual awareness, experiential awareness, and engagement of household to talk about climate change and adaptation. The Long Term Research Approach is appropriate to assess climate change vulnerability in community level. Climate change awareness is one of the major components to reduce vulnerability to climate change in the research area. This is a post adaptation vulnerability analysis of local community which supports climate change vulnerability adaptation policy.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/35557/27976,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

It is estimated as pregnancy related maternal mortality ratio (PRMR) in Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). However, 2011 National Population and Household Census (NPHC) gave a very high estimate of this indicator and challenged the 1996 and 2006 NDHS estimates. This warrants the evaluation of these estimates using another reliable source and this study aims to fill that gap. Method: The 2003 Nepal World Health Survey (WHS) data files were used to get PRMR for 1995-2002. SPSS syntax was used to create sibling history to compute PRMR for the country. Standard error was computed to get 95% confidence interval (CI) and compare it with NDHS and NPHC estimates.  Result: Data quality of sibling history was found to be reliable for getting maternal mortality estimates as age and age at death data was good. Adjusted PRMR of 285 was obtained for 1996-2002 with 95% CI of 161-391. This CI overlapped for 2006 NDHS estimate but it did not overlap the 1996 NDHS and 2011 NPHC estimates.  Conclusion: PRMR from 2003 Nepal WHS were found to be consistent with 1996 and 2006 NDHS as per reported confidence intervals but it was not consistent with the 2011 NPHC estimate. As NPHC used indirect method due to poor data quality of observed deaths and live births, it cannot be considered as a reliable estimate of PRMR. Thus, it is recommended to use surveillance based methods to get valid and reliable estimate of PRMR and MMR for Nepal.

Using the time series data of 48 years of the study period from 1975 to 2022, Engle-Granger’s co-integration and error correction models are used to examine the fiscal effects on the trade deficit, and the ARDL model is used to examine the effects on current account deficit. The basic variables used in the analysis are government expenditure to GDP ratio, budget deficit to GDP ratio, trade deficit to GDP ratio, broad money supply to GDP ratio, trade openness, real exchange rate, and real per-capita Indian GDP. Data are taken from the Ministry of Finance, Nepal Rastra Bank, and World Development Indicators. The findings show that the government expenditure to GDP ratio and trade openness positively affect the trade deficit as domestic factors, while real per-capita Indian GDP positively affects the trade deficit as an external factor. Also, the budget deficit to GDP ratio has a positive effect, while the broad money supply to GDP ratio has a negative effect on the current account deficit as domestic factors. The real exchange rate is negatively and real Indian per-capita GDP are positively driving the Nepal’s current account deficit as external factors.

The wide and increasing availability of census and socio-economic data, tools like GIS with an ease to use and advances in methodology has allowed increasing and refined GIS mapping of census variables. However, it is less emphasized that the result of analysis and presentation is always dependent on the unit of analysis. Data aggregation, choice of data classification method and spatial scale all have effect on mapping result. When administrative boundaries are restructured, it necessitates the aggregation of census data of one administrative level to another. In this context, the current paper explores the scale and zoning effect (changing boundary, changing number of units and data aggregation) on mapping census data. It explores the effect of four data classification methods at two spatial scales. Secondary data sources like local administrative boundary of Bajhang district and economically active population in agriculture is selected as representative census variable for mapping. GIS tool is applied for data mapping and analysis. The study found the higher calculated correlation value (0.88) for the restructured spatial units. The distribution of number of spatial units varied significantly between four data classification methods while plotted against the old boundary but there was not much variation in case of newly restructured boundary. The study found that zoning particularly, from smaller to larger units has blurred the spatial pattern visualization leading to a loss of the preferential information. The study concludes that the restructuring of administrative boundaries into larger unit has simplified the detail for spatial representation and has introduced additional generalization. For policy level analysis, use of data available at one level of the spatial unit when aggregated to higher level should be analyzed carefully using different data classification methods and visualization tools because scaled spatial representation matters in planning and policy aspect. It is meaningful to analyze data at different spatial scale to visualize and identify spatial variation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23413/19842,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

A tendency of skewing towards males is seen in Asian population attributable to various reasons, foremost being abortions. The decreasing number of female population is a form of gender discrimination and has serious implications for both sexes in the future. The purpose of this study was to analyze the trends of sex ratio at birth among deliveries at Lumbini Medical College Teaching Hospital, Palpa, Nepal over the past eight years.Materials and Methods: A retrospective audit of deliveries from 1st January 2008 to 31st December 2015 was carried out. Sex ratio at birth was calculated and its relationship with maternal age, birth order and number of previous abortions was analyzed.Results: The total number of live-births during the study period was 9394 consisting of 5008 male and 4350 female with an overall sex ratio at birth of 112.6. Every year, there was an increasing trend in total number of live births and sex ratio at birth. The number of male births increased with increase in parity but there was no statistical difference seen between maternal age, parity and number of abortions for male and female births.Conclusion: The sex ratio at birth in hospital deliveries is unbalanced with inclination towards male, more so in women with high parity. Additional research exploring the reason for increase in male births is needed, so that potential programs which can reverse this trend can be implemented.J Nepal Paediatr Soc 2016;36(1):68-71",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNPS/article/download/15086/12908,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising.

The current study is an attempt to explore potential risk with respect to physical infrastructure and assess modeled and actual physical damage and human loss caused by different earthquake scenario and actual 2015 earthquake event in Thecho of Kathmandu valley. The earthquake scenario is based on two nearest fault lines. Risk Assessment Tools for the Diagnosis of Urban Seismic Risk (RADIUS) method has been applied for estimation of potential building damage and casualties..The research has adopted integrated approach using secondary and primary data sources such as field observation, key informant survey and building survey through purposive random sampling.The study found that potential building damage estimated by RADIUS for Gorkha 2015 earthquake scenario and North-west (Khokana) are lower than the actual post-earthquake assessment whereas North earthquake scenario resulted higher loss. Actual damage caused by 2015 earthquake compared to modeled damage from RADIUS is found higher because additional damaged were made by successive aftershocks. Spatial distribution of potential building damage for earthquake scenarios and actual 2015 earthquake event is also variable.

The book presents a critical and radical analysis of factors that have kept Nepal in a state of underdevelopment and poverty, with huge section of the society in underprivileged and deprived socio-economic conditions, despite six decades of planning, seven decades of dependence on foreign aid, and numerous political regime changes, from the Rana regime for over a century from 1846-1950 through to the republic regime from 2007 onwards. To support this argument, the book delves into an exploration of growth performance in Nepal, government attempts at poverty alleviation, foreign aid and its effects in the economy and the nature of the state, with a focus on Maoists' 10-year rebellion. Each chapter presents the existing picture and examines the possible reasons for the failure in achieving the desired results. A comparative analysis of Nepal's position with respect to South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries is also presented in a number of chapters. The audience for the book will be students, academics and researchers, and within Nepal itself, intellectuals, politicians, and officials of the National Planning Commission, the central bank and other banks and financial institutions.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The economy is heavily dependent on tourism with an average of 1 million visitors per year prior to the pandemic. The country had just begun the ‘Visit Nepal 2020’ campaign when the government had to realign its economic activities and allocate resources to battling the impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The tourism sector crashed with 18.7% of the population falling into poverty. The health system faced reeling pressure with interruptions of routine services while the government struggled to provide care to COVID‐19 patients. There was a shortage of 20,000 healthcare workers and derailment of important health services, such as antenatal care, institutional delivery of babies and tuberculosis diagnosis. To fund the COVID‐19 vaccination efforts, the government sought donations and loans from other countries. There were disruptions in schools and the education system which had challenges in the delivery of education through digital means due to limited internet services. The agriculture and the food production system also faced major disruptions leading to exorbitant inflation and an increase in the cost of living. The country opened to normal socio‐economic activities by May 2022 in an effort to reverse the impacts on various sectors of life in Nepal.

Excavation of the shaft greater than 200 m length is a challenge due to vertical or inclined orientation, limited space, available technology and changing geological conditions. Amongst Alimak raise climber, shaft sinking and raise boring excavation methods, Alimak raise climber is most commonly used in Nepal. Selection of excavation method depends on geological conditions, size, length of shaft, access and of course the cost. Pressure shaft of Jhimruk, Khimti I, Chilime, Kaligandagi, Kulekhani, Khani Khola, Upper Tamakoshi and other hydroelectric projects were excavated with the help of conventional Alimak raise climber method. Severe overbreak problems were faced in Khimti I hydropower project during construction of upper inclined pressure shaft whereas recently 214 m vertical pressure shaft of Upper Tamakoshi and 280 m vertical pressure shaft of Khani Khola hydroelectric projects in Dolakha have been constructed successfully. Raise boring method was tried in Upper Tamakoshi Project but could not succeed due to deviation of pilot hole and hence shaft sinking and Alimak raise climber were used.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/22851/19411,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Death toll was nearly 9,000 and hundreds of thousands of inhabitants became homeless. The earthquake severely damaged mainly surface structures of hydro projects, access roads, clay mortar stone masonry houses and structurally weak concrete houses. Landslides, rock falls, debris flow, liquefaction, river damming, Landslides Dammed Outburst Flood (LDOF) and Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) are expected earthquake-induced hazards. However, landslides and grounds shaking were responsible for major damaged. A total of 15 hydro projects in operations and under construction were affected by the earthquake. In hydro projects damages were recorded in surface structures such as power house, settling basin, penstock pipes, and diversion weir constructed at base of steep terrains. For instance, surface penstock pipe, lying at base of rock cliff, of running 40 MW Upper Bhote Koshi Project was ruptured by rock falls and as a result flooded surface powerhouse located downstream by water from penstock and headrace tunnel. Similarly, diversion weir, surface settling basin and headrace penstock pipe of running 5 MW Mialung Project were also severely damaged by slides and rock falls. On the other hand, only minor cracking of sprayed concrete at corners and protruded edges in underground structures were observed. In hydro projects, there is a practice of considering seismic load in design of structures but the effects of earthquake induced hazards were not foreseen. This devastating earthquake gave good lessons for design considerations of hydro projects in future.

Diabetes was diagnosed on the basis of treatment history and random blood sugar test results of greater than 200 mg/dl. Diabetic retinopathy screening was done by ophthalmologists. All relevant data were imported into the RAAB software package (RAAB V.6) for analysis.Results: Among 4615 study population, 2.8 % (n=129) had diabetes, and 35.7% (n=46) of the diabetics were newly identified cases. Of the known diabetics, 61.4% (n=51) never had an eye examination, and only 27.7% (n=23) of cases had their eye checked for DR in the last year. Fundus examination showed 13.2 % (n=17) of the diabetic patients to have some form of diabetic retinopathy and 6.2% (n=8) had diabetic maculopathy. Only 0.8% (n=1) of the cases were categorized as sight-threatening DR but a greater number of diabetes patients had severe visual impairment or blindness (3.9%) as compared to non-diabetic patients (1.8%).Conclusions: Prevalence of diabetes and DR were relatively lower in Far-western Nepal. However poor coverage of screening examinations have left many of these cases undetected in the communities. Effective community-based diabetes and DR screening and referral programs can help to detect and treat diabetes and DR early on to prevent vision loss and other diabetic complications.

In doing so, a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for Nepal has been developed, incorporating the allocation of land for several agricultural crops, including the major staple foods, with specification of a nested set of constant elasticity of transformation (CET) functional forms. The set of land transformation elasticities facilitates switching from one crop to another; based on their agronomic characteristics and degree of climate change impacts. Using Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) data and Living Standard Survey (LSS) data, a social accounting matrix (SAM) for Nepal is developed and used to simulate three scenarios of climate change and land reallocation. The simulation results in the long run depict farmers as more likely to use land for crops that are comparatively less impacted by climate change, such as paddy. The results further show that land reallocation reduces the income inequality and poverty among rural and urban households by significantly controlling the income losses of marginal farmers.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13547860.2021.1982194,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Most of the officials are responsible for managing program and people rather than leading. Staff inspiration, motivation and encouragement, being one of the most important aspects of leadership, has been ignored in job description. District level officials are specifically assigned to manage programs and staff. As the position increases, the extent of practicing leadership increases and management decreases.

It increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases even leading to premature death. Almost half of the adults with hypertension had elevated blood pressure during childhood. With globalisation and lifestyle changes, adolescents are exposed to various risk factors. However, diagnosis in this population is difficult due to absence of symptoms. Thus, regular blood pressure screening is essential in these groups. This study aimed to find out the prevalence of hypertension and its determinants among the school going adolescents of Kathmandu, Nepal. Methods: This was a descriptive cross sectional study which included five private secondary schools of Kathmandu, Nepal. The adolescent students studying in classes VIII, IX and X were the study subjects. Two stage cluster random sampling technique was used to select 356 participants. Data collection was done by doing anthropometric measurements, blood pressure measurement and through self administered questionnaire. Results: The study depicted that the prevalence of elevated blood pressure was 12.4%, stage 1 hypertension 32.3% and stage 2 hypertension 9.8%. Similarly, 13.8% were overweight and 1.4% were obese. Bivariate analysis depicted significant association of prevalence of hypertension with gender, religion and obesity (p < 0.05). The multivariate analysis shows that the significant predictors of elevated blood pressure and/or hypertension were gender and obesity. Males were six times more likely to have elevated blood pressure (AOR = 6.058, CI = 2.571 - 14.274) and 2.8 times more likely to be hypertensive (AOR = 2.838, CI = 1.688 - 4.773) compared to females. Similarly, compared to obese/ overweight students, thin and normally built ones have less likelihood of having elevated blood pressure and hypertension. Conclusions: Hypertension has been prevalent among adolescents, due to various behavioural risk factors. This is really challenging and of public health significance.

Diverse climatic conditions of Nepal harbor five species of honeybee out of which Apis laboriosa, A. dorsata, A. cerena, A. florea are native, whereas Apis mellifera was introduced and is being reared commercially. Three sub-species of A. cerana, viz. A. cerana indica, A. cerana himalaya and A. cerana cerana are distributed in different regions of Nepal. A. cerena is cultivated in traditional log hive as well as in modern bee hive. However, most of the annual honey production comes from wild honeybees. Number of hives recorded during 2012/13 was 169,000 with 1625 metric tons of honey production. Hive productivity is low due to problems associated with apiculture; low quality management of bees, colony migration and absconding, pesticide intoxication, product quality control, inadequate data on bee floral identification and inadequate bee research program, are major concerns for beekeeping in Nepal. Though attempts have been made to address few issues such as pest and disease management, behavioral study of wild honey bees, pollination and floral diversity, but most of the problems are unattended because research on beekeeping is scattered and not well organized.

Fourteen thin sections were examined to understand the deformation and metamorphism in the region. Field observations such as fault breccias, fault gouge, lineation, and slickensides, along with petrographic evidence of inverted and dynamic metamorphism, cataclastic deformation, and ribbon quartz, suggest the presence of a thrust equivalent to the Mahabharat Thrust (MT), a significant tectonic feature in the study area. Microstructural indicators like undulose extinction, grain boundary migration, recrystallisation, and deformation lamellae in quartz further confirm this thrust's existence. Two distinct carbonate successions were identified: the southern unit correlates with the Lesser Himalayan sequence, while the northern, more metamorphosed carbonate unit is associated with the Bhimphedi Group, part of the Jajarkot Thrust Sheet. Stratigraphic continuity is disrupted in some sections, where quartzite and schist replace the basal carbonate strata, likely due to thrusting. The thrust's propagation has impacted both footwall and hanging wall rocks, evidenced by features such as rotated garnets with spiral inclusions.

The present study aims to find the relationship between gross motor function and nutritional status in these children by comparing the proportion of stunting, wasting and under-weight between the various levels of gross motor function. Methods: Our study was across- sectional study conducted on 82 cases of cerebral palsy between one to five years of age visiting Kanti Children’s Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from May 2017 to September 2018. Their level of gross motor function was ascertained by applying the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and anthropometry was done using standard methods. On the basis of their motor function, the children were divided into two categories: those with poorer motor function who had poor self-mobility even with assistance (GMFCS level 4 and 5) and those with better motor function who had self-mobility with various degrees of assistance (GMFCS level 1, 2 and 3). Wasting, stunting and under-weight were compared between the two categories and odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was estimated for malnutrition. Results: The children belonging to poorer motor function were more likely to be underweight (Odds ratio 3.41; CI 1.36-8.52; p-value 0.008) and stunted (Odds ratio 3.9; CI 1.47-10.53; p-value 0.048) than those with better motor function.

Various classes of carbapenemases had been reported in Nepal. Most frequent was the New Delhi Metallo beta lactamase with many variants where NDM-1 was most prevalent. Similarly, Oxacillinase and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase producers were also prevalent in Nepal. While other carbapenemases like VIM, IPM, and DIM also detected. The isolates producing carbapenemases were extremely drug-resistant as they also co-produced various other carbapenemases, beta-lactamases, 16S rRNA methylase. Most isolates were resistant to many members of carbapenem, cephalosporin, quinolone, penicillin, aminoglycoside group of antibiotics. Such isolates had very few treatment options as only last line drugs like colistin, fosfomycin, and tigecycline was effective against most of these isolates. Carbapenemase production by almost all major human pathogens including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter. Citrobacter, Proteus, Providencia is a matter of concern because some of these enzymes are located on plasmids and pose rapid dissemination among various gram-negative pathogens.

The major three themes and 12 sub-themes were generated from the study to find the impact of COVID-19 on the construction industry in Nepal. The study finds the three-level of impacts—financial, operational, and institutional on construction sectors. The government budget reduction, the deteriorating financial situation of the contractors, late payment, and over cost runs of the projects are the financial impact. Likewise, the operational level impact is related to delay in project completion, supply chain problems, difficulty in workforce management, and maintaining the health and safety of the workforce. The study finds no adequate support and special packages from the government, including professional associations.

The area for lentil production increased slightly in one decade, however its production has increased significantly during this period (2009-2019) The import value has soared at the rate of 22.7% per annum whereas the export value has decreased with 17% per annum. The trade specialization index was discovered 0.13, which indicates that the lentil is in the growth phase. The study provides sufficient information that it is necessary to surge the production and productivity to decrease the escalating imports while making the country independent in lentil production with an increased investment in research and development. Additionally, it is suggested to strength the Research and Development (R & D) in order to improve the productivity of lentil. More focus should be given in disseminating packages of Practices (POP).

In this paper, we address the issue for Nepal, a stereotypical financially closed developing economy that is highly dependent on resources from abroad. Distinguishing features of our approach are the use of a narrowly defined proxy of capital flight, based on trade cost‐adjusted mirror trade statistics, and the focus on the foreign‐exchange cash component of development aid. We document a robust partial correlation between aid and outward capital flight that is economically and statistically significant. Interestingly, this positive correlation is not observable for remittances, an alternative form of foreign‐exchange inflows where the capital flight motivation is absent. Furthermore, it is visible in the FX cash component but not in broader aid definitions that include in‐kind transfers, or in multilateral and IMF loans. Finally, when comparing the subcomponents of export underinvoicing and import overinvoicing, only the latter is driving our results.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/twec.13208,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

This is the first issue of volume 25 of JSSN. I take this opportunity to thank all the stakeholders of the JSSN and especially the founder of the JSSN.   A journal is a tool for publishing research and it is important to ensure that the research can be used by the community. They are important tools to disseminate scientific knowledge, improve the quality of research, identify new trends and provide a platform for published authors to showcase their work. Realizing this and with limited resources and experience in publishing, back in 1998 Prof. K. D. Joshi and his team published the first issue of the Journal of Society of Surgeons of Nepal. Because of their initiation, dedication and hard work, today we are here with this 25th volume to you.   The journal is an essential part of the scientific community, and it is essential for the advancement of knowledge. It is an important step in getting published, but publishing a journal is challenging especially in developing countries. Developing countries face unique challenges as compared to developed ones. The challenges of publishing in developing countries include lack of funds and limited resources, low quality of submissions, lack of qualified reviewers and editors, lack of publishers' support, low standards of proofreading etc. Scientific journals have become expensive to produce and there is little or no financial support available for their production. The costs include printing, distribution costs, website hosting and maintenance costs. While the whole of the editorial team are volunteers and some even have to spend out of their pocket for the journal. That’s the reason why there are not enough qualified volunteers for the editorial job in the journal. Most of the burden of work is on one or two persons. The most significant challenge is to get the right kind of peer review as peer review is also a volunteer task. Many authors who send the articles to the journal want early publication. But they don't have time to review articles for the same journal.   We while publishing JSSN face similar challenges. We are thankful to those who spent and are spending time and money on this novel task. This includes all past chief editors, editors, peer reviewers and technical staff.   Despite the challenges, JSSN is moving on to maintain national and international standards. We developed our online platform for article submission, processing and publication in 2014. Now all the new issues after that and most of the previous issues are available online. We received two stars (out of three) in the journal publishing practices and standards (JPPS) framework (https://www.journalquality.info)  in 2020 AD and working on getting three stars. We were able to get indexed in a reputed and prominent Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ, doag.org) in 2021.   Meeting the international standards and getting an index on a different platform is difficult because of a lack of funds and dedicated manpower for the journal. It also requires specific stringent criteria which need subscriptions to service and payment per article or yearly basis which is a burden for publishing societies. Publishing societies should support the journal to go ahead and be of international standard with additional cost if required.   The scientific community needs access to quality peer-reviewed journals that are accessible to researchers from developing countries. To reach this goal, we must invest more resources into supporting the journals and ensuring that they are sustainable. Journal is the face of a professional society like ours and is also one of the most important activities of society.  We are thankful to the Society of Surgeons of Nepal for the support which we have received till now. We hope JSSN will get more support and encouragement in future for the improvement of the quality of the journal and meeting ever-increasing international criteria of journal standards. Once again, we would like to thank all our readers, authors, peer reviewers, present and past editors and technical team for their support.

Primary aim was to measure adherence to anti-hypertensive medication and factors associated with low adherence.Methods: Morisky Medication Adherence Scale was used for measuring medication adherence and a structured questionnaire for measuring background and illness related factors in a cross-sectional study among 216 hypertensive patients in a tertiary care hospital selected through sequential sampling. Data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics and results presented with proportion or odds ratio with 95% CI.Results: It was found that 72% of the patients had low adherence to anti-hypertensive medication, with sub-group differences notably higher among females (77%); among those with co-morbidity (80%); and among those getting medicines free of cost (76%). Post multivariate logistic regression, it was found that patients with co-morbidity had higher odds of having low adherence (Adjusted Odds Ratio – AOR: 2.50; 95%CI:1.28-4.89) than those without; and those who get medicine free of cost had higher odds of having low adherence (AOR: 3.01; 95%CI:1.32-6.86) than those who pay for medicine.Conclusions: A substantial proportion of hypertensive patients had low adherence to medication. Presence of co-morbidity, getting medicine free of cost, and not having regular follow up were the major factors associated with low adherence to anti-hypertensive medication.

Dentists are subjected to intense interaction with patients on a regular basis. Burnout is considered a serious professional risk in dentistry. So, this study aimed to find out the prevalence of burnout in dental practitioners of Nepal and its association with different demographic and practice-related variables. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess outcomes among dental practitioners registered with the Nepal Dental Association from June to July 2021. All members were sent an online form to be filled out through emails. The questionnaire consisted of demographic and practice-related variables details along with a 16-item Oldenburg Burnout Inventory to assess burnout. Exhaustion and disengagement were the two components that were assessed with the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Statistical package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v 11.5 was used for data analysis. Mean, standard deviation, percentage were calculated and chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test were employed for inferential analysis. Results: A total of 155 dental practitioners were included in the study. The mean age of the participants was 32.44 years (SD: 5.20). The prevalence of burnout was found to be 69.7%. The number of practitioners with low exhaustion and low disengagement was 18 (11.6%) only. Burnout was more common among younger (p=0.043) and unmarried (p=0.017) participants.

The term PBC is coined to describe the fluctuation in economic activities from the intervention of the political actors before the election expecting to be re-elected in the forthcoming election. The abuse of political power in manipulating fiscal and monetary policies by the ruling party prior to the election period has become normal in developing countries like Nepal. The incumbent tries to convince their voters by increasing the size of the populist public expenditure before or during the election period. Nepal can’t be exceptional in the case of public resource manipulation during the time of the election. Democracy was restored in Nepal after the people’s political movement of 1990 and after that six consequent general elections were completed. The study used the annual data set from 1990/91 to 2017/18 and employed the ordinary least square method in three different models to capture the relationship among the variables used in the study. Real GDP, government consumption expenditure, and fiscal deficit are used as dependent variables of each model whereas government capital expenditure, transfer payment and subsidy, and total tax revenue are taken as independent variables under the study along with introducing election as a dummy variable. The results showed a positive relationship between the variables, but not enough to confirm the opportunistic political business cycle. The study recommends policymakers ensure policy consistency considering non-intervention in fiscal policies at the time of election.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/55074/42216,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

It is argued that fishing tourism should be systematically regularized and practiced in close collaboration with traditional ethnic fisher communities. Considering the potentiality, we elucidate the result of value chain analysis, arguing that promotion and streamlining of fishing tourism along with the traditional fishers could generate immense livelihood opportunities for resilience along with fish conservation. The value chain analysis showed that livelihood of fishers communities are likely to be enhanced by involving in fishing based tourism support services with fewer fishing activities, which in turn could be supportive to fish conservation.

As the urbanization is growing in the Kathmandu Valley the banks of the streams are being targeted for the housing and roads, therefore it is important to know the characteristic of the river behavior, nature of erosion and sediment production along its banks. This study accesses the stream bank erosion characteristics and sediment production by erosion along the Godavari Khola. It was conducted by surveying and accessing hydraulic parameters, Bank Erosion and Lateral Instability status, streambank recession rates and gross sediment erosion from the bank. The Godavari Khola has high bank erodibility and lateral instability as the hazard level of Bank Erosion and Lateral Instability (BELI) and width/depth ratio are quite high. Since the slope and the bankfull depth exceed the critical slope and critical depth values, respectively, the Godavari Khola is competent enough to mobilize its sediments. The apparent recession rate of the banks of the Godavari Khola is 0.66 m per year yielding 85 m3 volume of the displaced material which weighs 141 tonnes. The estimated bank erosion rate is in between 0.02 to 0.235 m/y and the gross erosion is estimated to be 320 tonnes per year.

With continuous increase in the gap between growth of export and that of import, Nepal’s increased trade imbalance is likely to jeopardize the country’s macroeconomic stability. In this context, understanding systematic relationships between international trade and economic growth aspects of Nepal would guide policy makers to formulate appropriate policies. This study is the first attempt to examine the causal relationships among real gross domestic product (GDP), exports, and imports for the case of Nepal. Utilizing annual data from 1965 to 2011, we investigate the causal relationships among the variables in a cointegration framework. We employ two methods for testing cointegration, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach and the trivariate Johansen approach, and consistently find existence of one cointegrating relationship among real GDP, exports, and imports. Moreover, the empirical tests show that the estimated long-run parameters are stable over time. Applying multivariate Granger causality tests based on error correction and vector autoregression models, we find unidirectional causality running from export to GDP both in the short- and the long-run, thus supporting the export-led growth (ELG) hypothesis. Although imports are found to Granger cause GDP, the long-run estimates show significantly negative effect of imports on GDP implying a negative causality. In this context, trade policies that substitute imports seem more pertinent for Nepal. The results highlight necessity of fostering exports, which would require establishment of proper infrastructure, both physical and institutional, for trade and investment capital for industrialization focusing on commodities that have comparative and competitive advantages. Moreover, fulfillment of domestic demand with less reliance on imported goods and increment of productivity in all sectors of the economy is crucial.

There is high energy requirement to produce breast milk, which is wholesome food for under 6 months children and then complementary foods are introduced to child. Inadequate feeding practices affect nutritional status of children. The main aim of this study was to measure the dietary practices of lactating women and nutritional status of their children.Material and Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted among 343 lactating women and under two years children of Baglung district. Random sampling technique was applied to select the participants. Face to face interview was conducted among women to collect the data and anthropometric measurement was performed among the children. Data were entered in EPI-DATA version 3.2 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 17.0) for further analysis.Results: Only 5.2% of mother had taken additional two meals per day and energy intake of 31.8% of women was met. Dietary practices of mothers were not associated with nutritional status of children. Breastfeeding practice was nearly universal (99.7%). Bulks (91.8%) of children were put into breast for breast feeding within first hour of birth. Exclusive breastfeeding rate was 34.5%. Bottle feeding was practiced by 15.6% of women. Less than half (40%) of 6-23 months children (n=174) had achieved satisfactory feeding practice (minimum meal frequency and minimum dietary diversity). The rate of wasting (n=180), stunting (n=180) and underweight (n=343) was 10%, 22.2% and 9.3% respectively. Feeding practice to children was associated with wasting and stunting.Conclusion: Dietary practice of women and feeding practice to their children was not satisfactory. Dietary practice of women was not associated with nutritional status of children but feeding practice was associated with their nutritional status. The rate of stunting, wasting and underweight was high.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNPS/article/download/19513/17862,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The aim of this study was to address this gap and create awareness regarding essence of control of Diabetes and Hypertension among political cadres of Nepal as they play major role in policy making. Materials & Methods:A descriptive cross-sectional study in the political cadres of Nepal was conducted at Pragya Bhawan, Kathmandu on 4th March, 2012 where delegates attended their 3rd National assembly. Standard criteria were used to describe both Hypertension and Diabetes and their respective goals. Awareness and treatment were based on self-report.Results:A total of 291 subjects were included in the study. The prevalence of hypertension was 44.32% while that of Diabetes was 18.56%. The current blood pressure of the study population was 50% within normal range and 50% of them was above normal range, body mass index of 35% was normal and rest was above normal range. 15% of the study population was known diabetic while 33% was known hypertensive. More than 50% of known diabetics had poor control over blood sugar and 72% of the known hypertensive had poor blood pressure control.Conclusion:The scenario of hypertension and diabetes control among the political cadres is not up to the mark.

Two mandarin growing districts Tanahun and Syangja of Gandaki province were selected for study purposes. A simple random method of sampling was employed to select 45 mandarin farmers from each district making a total sample size of 90. Primary data were collected with the help of a pre-tested semi-structured interview schedule along with two focus group discussions and field observation of the mandarin orchard. Data were analyzed by using both descriptive and inferential statistics. This paper explored the mandarin production status, major post-harvest practices, marketing channels, and barriers to post-harvest technology adoption. The findings revealed that farmers were producing 5.4 tons of fresh mandarin each year earning around 50 thousand Nepalese rupees as profit from mandarin farming. Similarly, the result showed that the post-harvest loss was 8%-9% during the harvesting, grading, and packaging operation while a loss of 2%-3% was recorded during the transportation of mandarin from the production site to the wholesaler site. In total, loss ranging from 14%-18% was recorded in all chains of mandarin postharvest operations. Also, it was found that more than two-thirds (76.7%) of farmers practiced mandarin marketing based on preharvest contracts. The technical know-how of farmers about post-harvest technologies was a major challenge associated with the low adoption of mandarin post-harvest technologies. The concerned government agency, I/NGOs, and other organizations need to emphasize post-harvest loss issues by incorporating loss minimization activities in their program ensuring higher adoption of postharvest technologies by mandarin farmers and traders.",https://journals.nasspublishing.com/index.php/rwae/article/download/787/701,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

A well-developed stock market could promote the volume of domestic savings, saving mobilization, capital formation, and efficient allocation of capital in productive sectors of the economy that ultimately helps for increasing income, output, and employment and thereby enhance the economic growth of the nation. The study followed quantitative analysis and deductive method by using secondary data of 27 years from 1994 to 2021. It used ARDL model, co-integration test, bound test, CUSUM, and CUSUMQ test for data analysis. It employs the real gross domestic product as a proxy variable for economic growth while broad money supply, market capitalization, stock market turnover, NEPSE index, and listed companies are taken as the indicator of stock market development. The study found that there is a significant contribution of broad money supply, market capitalization and NEPSE index to real GDP. But, there is a weak contribution of stock market turnover to real GDP that indicates a liquidity problem in Nepalese stock market. It concludes that stock market development has a significant contribution for economic growth in Nepal. Hence, it is suggested that policymakers should think about the stock market development for the economic growth of Nepal. ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/55025/42206,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The nature and level of people’s participation is highly determined by gross household income and socio-economic factors. A multiple log regression analysis used to examine the level of people’s participation as dependent variable and gross household income along with other socio-economic factors as independent variables. Correlation coefficients, coefficient of determinants, adj-coefficient of determinants, t-test, F-test and D-W test are major tools used for data analyses. The study found that as people received more forest products and other benefits from forest protection and management in short and long term, local people significantly participate in forestry programs.

Road traffic injuries are a major global public health problem despite being avoidable and preventable. In many low- and middle-income countries, the victims of road traffic crashes do not receive care at the scene and may die before reaching hospital. In low- and middle-income countries where prehospital emergency medical services are not well established, bystanders have the potential to save lives by providing first aid. Nepal has rising rates of road traffic injuries and emergency medical services are early in development. There is limited evidence on the factors that influence people in Nepal to become trained in first aid and to use their first aid skills.


To understand the barriers and facilitators to learning first aid and to applying those skills to help road traffic crash victims in Nepal.


Qualitative study using semistructured interviews.


Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kaski and Makwanpur districts in Nepal.


We interviewed three groups of participants: (1) members of the public who had never been trained in first aid, (2) members of the public who had been trained in first aid and (3) first aid trainers.


Interviews explored reasons why people may be interested in being trained and factors that would inhibit being trained or applying their first aid skills. Interviews were transcribed, translated into English and analysed thematically.


Respect from the public, a desire to help those in need and confidence to apply skills were important factors in encouraging people to learn and apply first aid. Barriers included lack of time and financial implications of providing first aid. The fear of social and legal consequences if the patient had a poor outcome, a lack of confidence to apply skills and lack of trust shown to first aiders by some members of the community discouraged learning and using first aid skills.


Participants were mostly from urban and semiurban areas. People with more difficult access to health care may have held different views. People who were untrained in first aid and agreed to participate may hold different views to those who were not recruited, as they had interest in the topic.


Members of the public can be encouraged to learn and apply first aid skills to help road traffic crash victims, but there are multiple barriers to engagement in first aid. Providing legal protection from prosecution for first aiders, raising public awareness of the value of first aid, addressing financial constraints and provision of refresher training may address these barriers.


Research to address the barriers to the creation of a Good Samaritan law appears warranted. The perspectives of other groups often involved in the care and/or transport of road traffic crash victims, such as taxi drivers, would add to our understanding of factors affecting the application of first aid. The gendered stereotypes reported by female first aiders warrant further exploration.

As a result, both the post-war government and foreign donors invested in policies aimed to harness the productive capacities of young people in restructuring the nation. This article explores the theme of aspiration on the national and personal level and their convergence through a micro-finance program in post-war Nepal, the Youth, Small Enterprise, and Self-Employment Fund (YSEF). The national-level aspiration to make ‘new Nepal’ hinged on young people fulfilling their personal aspirations. I consider whether post-conflict pacification measures like YSEF can foster the sense of national belonging necessary by analyzing the challenges faced in instituting this loan scheme nationally and locally along Nepal’s open border with India. Analyzing YSEF’s institution from a borderland optic reveals assumptions inherent in peacebuilding intervention and limits YSEF’s ability to wholly accommodate its recipients. I suggest that the government’s attempt to bring marginalized youth into the ‘official’ economic fold through YSEF falls short in accommodating young people’s livelihood aspirations within their lived reality. Instead young people are creating pathways beyond state dependence.",,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The research emphasizes the need to reduce income and social security disparities across industries, regions, and labor markets for balanced employment opportunities, especially for higher education institution (HEI) graduates. Data from 162 community college graduates in Rupandehi district, spanning 17 colleges, are meticulously collected while adhering to ethical and safety measures. This research provides valuable insights into the status and role of human resources produced by community colleges, benefiting various stakeholders. In the context of Nepal, the study addresses the shift in labor outmigration trends to developed countries for employment opportunities. It explores how graduates effectively convert their skills and knowledge into sustainable income within diverse economic sectors. Higher education institutions (HEIs) are integral to Nepal's economy, producing a dynamic workforce. The study highlights the importance of ensuring that investments in education lead to productive employment outcomes, with many graduates contributing to self-employment and job creation. Employing a mixed-method approach, combining field surveys and HEI data, this research sheds light on the complex interplay between education and employment in Nepal.

Secondly, low productivity earnings associated with a sizeable segment of the employed population. Eemployment patriotism is the judicial blend of employment and economic patriotism. Every government action is needed to be guided by employment generation motives. In addition to the increased pressure due to an unprecedented volume of COVID-19 induced returnees, the economic downturn due to the pandemic may also reduce the global demand for migrant workers.

On top of that, recruitment and retention of OBs-GYNs is a pressing problem, especially in district hospitals of Nepal. In this connection, evidence on the job priorities and preferences of OBs-GYNs, which is currently lacking in Nepal, would help in policymakers in devising recruitment and retention strategies in these hospitals. This study, therefore, aims at exploring the most relevant job attributes that OBs-GYNs would prefer to work in the district hospitals of Nepal using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) technique. Methods: Job attributes relevant to design the questionnaire were identified using keyinformant interviews and focusgroup discussions with policymakers and top managers. Then, 48 choice sets were developed using a fractional factorial design. Using these unlabeled choice sets, a DCE was conducted among 189 OBs-GYNs. The multinomial logistic regression model was used to estimate the marginal utilities and other model parameters. The willingness to pay/accept estimates was also measured for each job attribute. Results: OBs-GYNs preferred the presence of a full team at the workplace (OB-GYN, pediatrician, and anesthesiologist), provision of primary and secondary education for children, and opportunity of private practice. On the other hand, a few job attributes such as a higher duration of service in district hospitalsand the provisions of a car allowance were preferred less by the respondents. Results from the marginal utility by the OBs-GYNs would be open to trade among the attributes. Conclusions: The job attributes identified as incentives in this study should be included in a package to attract OBs-GYNs to serve in district hospitals of Nepal rather than offering a standard incentive package to all health workers. Similarly, this study confirmed the importance of the combination of non-monetary and monetary interventions in attracting and retaining health workers in district hospitals of Nepal.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12960-019-0427-8.pdf,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

At a time when the country’s major economic indicators are not favorable, remittances have played a vital role in maintaining macroeconomic stability and keeping the economy afloat. Though remittances sent home by migrant workers are a boon to the economy, the facilities are inadequate to back up the increasing trend of migration. Inadequate information on foreign employment, lack of skill training, and lack of assurance of safe working environment and rights of the migrant workers have obstructed foreign employment.

This study aims to identify the additional financial burdens faced by Nepalese migrant workers in Gulf countries. Methodology: A qualitative research design was used, with purposive sampling to select participants who had migrated to Gulf countries. In-depth interviews with 55 migrant laborers were conducted to gather data on cost burdens and employment conditions. Findings: Results showed that the indirect cost burden increased significantly after 2015 due to extended processing periods and technical procedures. Respondents generally preferred regulations before 2015. Despite legal changes like the ""Free Visa: Free Ticket"" policy reducing direct expenses, intermediaries and other indirect costs have offset this reduction, increasing the financial burden on migrant workers. Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights into Nepal's foreign employment complexities, urging more research and measures for migrant worker well-being. Findings reveal intermediaries exploiting workers by altering passport photos or obtaining counterfeit birth certificates.

Lack of effective advertisement and marketing, inequitable price, scarcity of raw materials, intrusion of foreign goods, ineffective government policies are the crucial tribulations of handicraft products tourism in Pokhara. State policy improvement, increase in supply of raw materials, creative production and marketing are the ways that can promote handicraft market.

In South Asia, including Nepal, low female labor force participation persists due to various challenges such as gender-based violence, discrimination, and societal norms. This study aims to investigate factors influencing women's employment status in Nepal focusing on education, children, wealth, partner's education, and other socio-economic factors. <bold>Method:</bold> Data from the Nepal Demographic Health Survey 2016 was obtained through a DHS website. A working dataset was constructed, comprising 11 independent variables, and cleaned for analysis. Missing values were addressed, and the statistical analysis plan included descriptive analysis and chi-square tests to examine relationships between variables. <bold>Results: </bold>The socio-demographic profile of married women aged 15-49 in Nepal reveals a predominance of male-headed households, urban residency, and secondary education attainment. Unadjusted logistic regression findings indicate significant associations between women's employment status and factors such as age, rural residency, lower education levels, more children, and poorer household wealth. However, multivariate analysis suggests that female-headed households have slightly lower employment likelihood. Age and education emerge as key determinants, with older and educated women more likely to be employed. Provincial disparities are evident, with certain provinces showing increased employment odds, while mobile phone ownership is associated with higher employment likelihood. These findings emphasize the complex interplay of factors influencing women's employment status, underscoring the need to address socio-economic disparities for enhanced empowerment and economic participation. <bold>Conclusion: </bold>Findings reveal a higher prevalence of employment among women compared to the unemployment rate, yet disparities persist between male and female employment rates. Women with no education are more likely to be employed in daily waged labor-intensive jobs, indicating a need for targeted interventions to enhance employment opportunities, particularly in disadvantaged regions like Province 6. The study underscores the association between women's age and education levels with employment status, highlighting the importance of educational attainment in facilitating employment. Moreover, findings suggest a positive correlation between the husband's education level and women's employment, emphasizing the significance of household dynamics. Recommendations include the development of employment programs tailored to women's educational backgrounds and vocational training initiatives to enhance their participation in professional sectors, ultimately fostering economic independence and empowerment at the local level.</p>",https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4275392/v1,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

It is deemed that a person has an informal job or employment if their employment relationship is, legally or practically, exempt from national labor legislation, income taxation, social protection, or the right to specific employment benefits. In Nepal, the problem of informal work is growing, and the economic yardstick for measuring social justice is the wage gap. This research uses a logistic regression approach to examine the factors that influence informal employment in Nepal. The computation of the factors affecting informality and wage disparities in informal employment in Nepal was done using two estimating techniques. The daily salary is significantly negatively impacted by informal employment. The workers who participate in informality make less money per day than those who work in regular employment. The findings indicate a positive and statistically significant relationship between worker age and daily pay. Workers are more likely to make a daily wage the older they are. When the workers are of the janajati ethnic group, their daily wages increase. But the daily wage of workers is not much impacted by dalit laborers. Workers who are married are more likely than other workers to have greater daily pay. They are therefore favorably related to one another. The outcome also showed that the worker's daily income grows along with their level of education.

Using a quasi-experimental approach, this report presents the short-run effects of skills training and employment placement services in Nepal.

Participation in the Employment Fund training program generated an increase in non-farm employment of 15 to 16 percentage points for an overall gain of about 50 percent. The program also generated an average monthly earnings gain of about 72 percent.

Under the assumption that there are fertile prospects to bridge social responsibility and SDGs judiciously, this chapter explores the question: ‘what insights into women’s employment and empowerment can be generated from the state of cooperative enterprises in Nepal?’ The focus is on aspects of women’s employment and empowerment under goal 8, which promotes inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. Learning from the Nepalese experiences, the chapter contends that cooperative enterprise social responsibility (CESR) needs to be approached as the vital link between the internal and the external interests of cooperatives to achieve SDGs.",https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full-xml/10.1108/S2040-724620180000008016,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The results show that formal education has increased substantially. However, formal sector employment has remained relatively stable. Individuals with tertiary education are about twice as often employed in the formal sector than individuals without completed primary education. This relationship is less strong for secondary education (22%) and primary education (7%). The results further show that about half of the relationship arises from working in government-related sectors. The overall picture regarding the relationship between formal education and formal sector employment has remained similar over time. However, the strength of the relationship between completed primary and secondary education and formal sector employment has decreased over time. The relationship between tertiary education and formal sector employment has remained stable unless the government related sectors are excluded.",https://nepjol.info/index.php/JER/article/download/30462/24396,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Due to lack of employment opportunities in public and private sectors, Nepali people are motivated to go foreign countries for job opportunities. Handsome salaries, respected life, relief from poverty and fulfillment of needs – these are the common motivators that lead people for foreign employment. This can be right in one aspect but there are a lot of evidences and scenarios that show foreign employment is not so easier and fruitful as it is thought. Foreign employees have to face many more difficulties and obstacles in foreign countries that one will explain after his return to home country. So the income from their hard labor must be utilized in proper sectors. Various data in this study show the foreign employment is not so safe. Here, the time series data from 2002/03 to 2019 are taken for the study of the relationship between remittance and investment. The regression analysis with P-value 0.000 at 5% significant level (α= 0.05) which shows that the remittance from foreign employment has been used in investment anyway.

We used longitudinal data from a prospective cohort of women in the Sarlahi District of southeastern Nepal to assess whether part-time employment was associated with a change in mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) between baseline and five-years. The women enrolled in the study (n =715) had applied for part-time employment distributing weekly vitamin A supplements to married women of childbearing age. Over the five-years of follow-up, women received 900 Nepalese rupees ($15 USD) per month, for approximately five hours of work per week. The women who were hired (n =324) were younger and better educated than those who were not hired (n =391), but were otherwise similar. After baseline adjustments, change in MUAC (in cm) (β = 0.08; 95 % CI: -0.20, 0.36) was not associated with employment. Also, changes in MUAC over time were inversely related to baseline MUAC, with better nourished women gaining less (MUAC of 23 - 24.99: β = -0.83; 95% Confidence Interval CI: -1.18, -0.48; MUAC of ≥ 25: β = -0.99; 95% CI: -0.99, -0.54) compared to thin women (MUAC <21). In this sample, women employed part-time did not have improved nutritional status as compared to their unemployed counterparts. Future research should explore the impact of women's employment on the nutritional status of other members of the household, particularly children, and among women employed full-time.",http://openaccesspub.org/ijn/article/181,,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Not only do females have in common with males the mistreatment, reliance and inequities that ensue from deprivation and vulnerability; additionally, they also endure societal and spiritual prejudices and viewpoints that distinguish what women are unsuitable to achieve, that impede their rightful involvement in community, civil and commercial existence, and that neglect to acknowledge or respect the assets, encounters and inspiration of half the world's inhabitants The chapter includes a discussion around the benefits and pitfalls of different types of tourism connected to the pro-poor sphere.

Simple random sampling was used to select 60 beneficiaries and 30 non-beneficiaries as sampling units to comprise a sample size of 90. Representatives of WUGs and officials of PIP were interviewed through checklists. Altogether there were 75 WUGs, which are responsible for distribution of irrigation water equitably and collection of irrigation charges effectively. A comparative study was made between the beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries under PIP. The total farm assets of beneficiaries were estimated at NRs. 1,150,975 and differed significantly with the non-beneficiaries with total farm assets of NRs. 875,185. A significant difference was observed between on farm income of beneficiaries (NRs.183,260) and non– beneficiaries (NRs. 31,453). The net farm income of the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries were estimated at NRs. 79,993 and NRs. 13,077 respectively and the difference were significant among the categories of respondents. The total farm income was significantly affected by landholding, total variable cost, cropping intensity, and employment in case of beneficiaries whereas only employment significantly affected total farm income in case of non-beneficiaries. Gini coefficients for gross household and gross farm income were calculated at 0.37 and 0.44 respectively for beneficiaries and 0.44 and 0.27 respectively for non-beneficiaries. So, there existed inequality in distribution of gross household and gross farm incomes within both categories.
