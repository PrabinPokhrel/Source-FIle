Here, we report on evidence that interfacing two metal thin films can suppress spin transmission and absorption. We examine spin pumping in spin-source/spacer/spin-sink heterostructures, where the spacer consists of metallic Cu and Cr thin films. The Cu/Cr spacer largely suppresses spin pumping—i.e., neither transmitting nor absorbing a significant amount of spin current—even though Cu or Cr alone transmits a sizable spin current. The antiferromagnetism of Cr is not essential for the suppression of spin pumping, as we observe similar suppression with Cu/V spacers with V as a nonmagnetic analog of Cr. We speculate that diverse combinations of spin-transparent metals may form interfaces that suppress spin pumping, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our work may stimulate a new perspective on spin transport in metallic multilayers.",,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Prehypertension remains neglected as a public health problem, and has not been explored in mothers with small children in Nepal.Objectives: We aimed to study prehypertension and its related factors including obesity-related parameters among mothers with children aged 1-7 years in Duwakot and Jhaukhel communities of Bhaktapur district, Nepal.Methods: We prepared a sampling frame of all the eligible mothers, and interviewed 962 mothers. The trained enumerators also measured their blood pressure, body weight, height, waist and hip circumferences. We analysed data with SPSS version 22. We received ethical approval from the Nepal Health Research Council to conduct the study, and obtained informed verbal consent from the participating mothers.Results: About one-third (31.8%) of the mothers had prehypertension. It was more common among Newars and those aged 30-34 years. Multivariate analysis did not reveal significant association with socio demographic variables except for education. We found positive correlations between blood pressure and obesity parameters. Overweight and obese participants were 2.24 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-4.73) and 4.65 (95% confidence interval: 1.92-11.23) times, respectively, more likely to have prehypertension than underweight mothers.Conclusions: Our study demonstrated a high prevalence of prehypertension, coupled with high obesity parameters, among young mothers of peri-urban Nepal.

The study aimed to explore children’s preference for diet and physical activity in a peri-urban area of Nepal because this is an important dimension to explore in the life-course approach to combat non-communicable diseases.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to enquire young peri-urban children of Duwakot and Jhaukhel villages of Bhaktapur district, Nepal on their preferences for diet and physical activity. All eligible households with children in the age range 5-10 years as enlisted from the Jhaukhel-Duwakot Health Demographic Surveillance Site database were selected for the study. Twelve enumerators visited the selected households and facilitated the eligible children to fill in the questionnaire. We used a child-friendly photo-assisted questionnaire with face-scales that easily enabled the children to select a particular preference for each of the food item and physical activity. During analysis, food items were categorized into ‘green’, ‘yellow’ and ‘red’ on the basis of their nutritive values. Physical activity was categorized based on severity of the activity. Results: Four hundred and thirty seven children filled up the questionnaires. Overall, median preference scores for ‘red’ food were higher than for healthier ‘green’ food (4.16 vs. 4.03), particularly, if mothers were self-employed. Likewise, the children preferred low over moderate-to-severe physical activity (4.16 vs. 3.50), and preference was affected by parents’ occupation and income. Conclusions: The study objectively revealed that most of the children preferred unhealthier food-items and low physical activities.

So the research was scoped to study about safety status in building construction sites and also and to assess the ways to improve safety practices. For the study purpose, a field observation was carried out at two building construction sites in Bharatpur Municipality. Data about use of PPE as safety practice was collected using a checklist survey and the analysis showed that the practice was not satisfactory in the observed sites. A questionnaire survey was carried out to identify the likelihood and consequences of different risks that could occur in building projects and risk level rating was assigned to the risks identified. Falling from height and electric shocks were assigned top two ratings. Questionnaire survey was then carried out to explore the ways that could improve the safety practices at a construction site.

The purpose of this article is to illustrate and theorise the discourse of reconstruction and return that shapes experiences, strategies, and policies in order to gain a better understanding of the obstacles to pursuing durable solutions that are still shaping the reality of life for urban internally displaced people (IDPs) in Kathmandu Valley. I use the concepts of ‘fields of practice’ and ‘disaster justice’ to provide insights into the theorisation of the links between social inequality, structural forms of governance, and the reconstruction process itself. Findings demonstrate that the application of these concepts has great potential to expand our understanding of ‘realities of life’ and practices of IDPs, and thus contribute to a more differentiated evidence base for the development and implementation of appropriate disaster risk reduction policies and practices.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/10/3/110/pdf,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

However, some ideas for sustainable post-pandemic planning and development have already become apparent. For example, urban centers must facilitate the safe and efficient movement of essential workers and residents using real time information. Cities should also provide open and safe spaces for the residents to gather for recreation, de-stressing and as the means of reducing the urban densities. Planners are contemplating developing an effective transportation network that could be more efficient, sanitary and effective to keep urban areas safe if similar pandemics emerge in the future.

Parent-adolescent communication is a fundamental process through which parents convey ideas, values, beliefs, expectations, information, and knowledge to their children. Parents are one of the primary stakeholders who plays important roles in protecting adolescents from risky sexual behaviors such as unsafe sex, unwanted pregnancy, substance use, and violence. Methodology: A quantitative, descriptive cross-sectional study using self- administered questionnaire was carried out in sundarharaincha municipality of koshi province among 265 adolescent participants. Simple random sampling was used for selecting schools while purposive sampling was used for participant selection. Excel and SPSS were being used for data coding, decoding, and statistical analysis. Findings: According to the survey, a minority of respondents (31.3%) had inadequate understanding of SRH issues, while the majority (68.7%) had appropriate knowledge of these issues. Additionally, the majority of respondents (70.2%) reported having a sufficient amount of communication with their parents regarding SRH difficulties, whereas the minority (29.8%) reported having a low degree of communication. Conclusion: The survey indicates that adolescents have a good understanding of sexual and reproductive health and effectively communicate with their parents about health-related issues.

This research investigates key areas such as pedestrian safety in the absence of sidewalks, the proper use of vehicle side lights, and the comprehension of road features like super-elevation. A comprehensive survey involving nearly 200 participants from the Kathmandu Valley revealed significant misconceptions and knowledge gaps. A substantial 68.4% of respondents erroneously believed that walking on the left side was safer for pedestrians without footpaths, highlighting a critical area for public education. Additionally, 31.6% misunderstood the correct use of vehicle side lights, often misusing them to signal overtaking intentions, which poses a considerable risk on the roads. While 79% of participants recognized the role of super-elevation in preventing vehicle overturns, 60% lacked detailed knowledge about its mechanics and benefits, leading to improper driving techniques. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced public education on traffic rules and road safety features. Recommendations include incorporating these topics into driver licensing exams, launching targeted educational campaigns, and developing practical training modules to foster informed decision-making and safer road practices. By addressing these educational gaps and misconceptions, this study aims to contribute to sustainable improvements in Nepal's road safety landscape, ultimately reducing traffic-related accidents and injuries and promoting a culture of road safety awareness and compliance.",,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

However, there is a widespread view that young men and women are becoming more at ease in each other's company and beginning sexual experiences prior to marriage, putting them at risk of the consequences of unsafe sex. This research aims to evaluate the factors associated with premarital sexual behavior and its consequences among Nepalese college-going adolescents and youths. This cross-sectional web-based study included 415 Nepalese students over the age of 18 who were enrolled in a bachelor's degree program in a discipline other than health science. Data was collected from students online using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Pearson's chi-square (χ2) and logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between the independent and outcome variables. Most participants (61.7%) had dating experience and 21.2% had premarital sex. About three-fourths (76.1%) of participants had premarital sex before the age of 20 years and the ages of sexual debut ranged from 13 to 25 years. The major reasons for sexual debut were desire, curiosity, continuation of love relationship, and peer pressure. One-third of students (33.0%) reported having more than two sex partners, and 11.4% had intercourse with commercial sex workers. Among students who had premarital sex, 13.7% of participants or their sex partners, had to undergo abortions because of unintended pregnancies. Having an illiterate parent (AOR=11.0; 95% CI=2.01-60.87), high pocket money (AOR=4.2; 95% CI=1.1-16.2), increased dating culture (AOR=18.8; 95% CI=4.8-74.2), a close friend who has experienced premarital sex (AOR=5.2; 95% CI=2.21-12.21), and exposure to pornography (AOR=97.87; 95% CI= 9.5-10001.4) were predictors of premarital sex among Nepalese college students.

In Nepal, the goal of the National Urban Agenda is to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, sustainable and smart to enhance their ability to provide decent jobs and adequate housing, infrastructure and services to the ever-growing urban population”. Against this backdrop, many international and national non-governmental organisations and the national federations of informal settlers in Nepal have been advocating for the rights of urban informal settlers to be included in the urban planning processes. In response, the Nepal government has formulated new policies to assess the “authenticity” of informal settlers and accelerate the informal to formal transition process. Drawing from the textual analysis of existing national policies, literature and media publications, in this paper, we document what (dis)connections and contradictions exist in the formal policies and interventions that the national government has designed for addressing urban informality issue and how they frame urban informality issues and the solutions to manage the same. Our analysis shows that although government policies are rhetorically inclusive and progressive, indicating a desire to resolve informality issues, policies issued by different ministries and departments are disconnected. We also find that the practices often contradict the policies, and attempts to secure transitions to formality are undermined by a failure to recognise the legitimate stake that informal settlers have in the process. We conclude by discussing how these contradictions and inconsistencies can potentially be redirected towards socially just urban transition and suggesting ways forward for addressing the protracted urban informality issue in Nepal.",,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Simultaneously, the water being diverted or transferred from these peri-urban areas is rapidly evolving. This paper describes the changing modes of urban oriented water flow from the peri-urban landscape of Kathmandu and the implications of this water transfer on water security of peri-urban areas. Through series of semi-structured interviews, formal and informal discussions with local people and key informant interviews, the study found that Matatirtha, a peri-urban village, has traditionally been a source of water for the domestic water demand in Kathmandu. However, the social and economic developments have induced a paradigm shift in urban water transfer from the area and promoted the economic benefits as a way of compensating the loss of local water resources. Moreover, the increasing opportunities of economic benefits through water in absence of regulatory mechanism have facilitated exploitation of resources. This, therefore, created need of strong mechanism, promoting insights for sustainable management of water resources and contribute to improve rural urban linkages through optimal use of water resources.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/njst.v15i1.12025 Nepal Journal of Science and TechnologyVol. 15, No.1 (2014) 99-106",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/12025/9775,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Bird diversity serves as a good ecological indicator; hence, this study examined the effects of urbanization on bird species counting and diversity in East-west highway from Lothar Khola to Tikauli Bufferzone Forest, Chitwan. Bird surveys were conducted during the spring season and pre-monsoon seasons of 2022 along fifteen transects each of 2 km length by positioning the point count stations at every 2 km interval on vehicle survey. A total of 3,147 birds of 63 species were observed from 28 families. Among the 63 species, 58 were residents and 5 were migratory. The associations of bird richness and abundance were found higher in forest area that covers almost 20% of the total surveyed transects. Number of nest were also recorded throughout the entire survey and majority of nest were of Baya weaber. Conversely, road under construction showed negative effects. In an urban setting, 100 nesting sites were recorded on electric pole, tree species and some on the residential houses.

However, the extent to which these different benefits may reinforce or compete with one another is not clear. This paper presents an integrated modelling framework using proxy measures for economic benefit (the net margin, NM), social benefit (the full-time farmer employment equivalent (FTE) per consumer) and environmental benefit (reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, CO2). The model is applied in two divergent development scenarios, including Adelaide, Australia, and the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, to study the characteristic features of UA in different settings. Two-stage optimisation is used to explore trade-offs and synergies when pursuing different objectives (NM, FTE and CO2). The model seeks the optimal farming area and selects from three levels of mechanisation (non-mechanised, garden tiller and garden cultivator), two purposes (gardening and commercial), two crop value categories (mixed and mid- to high-value vegetables) and two market mechanisms (wholesale vs. retail). The results of the optimisation provide insights into the key features of a UA system depending on the objective(s) being pursued, which we believe is a novel approach to justify UA research. For instance, the model favours a commercial UA form (in which both land and labour are costed) with a larger area when pursuing an economic objective, whereas it favours a gardening form of UA when aiming to maximise participation in the food system, with the preferred area depending on the extent to which either the economic or environmental objective is also being pursued. In Adelaide, the model favours commercial UA for the best-case profit and carbon emissions, and gardening for FTE maximisation. In the Kathmandu Valley, the model chooses the gardening UA within the given model assumptions.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/14/11251/pdf,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

The factors underlying the disease conditions manifested during adulthood commonly originate in childhood. Nepal is going through a transition where under-nutrition co-exists with obesity; however, there is a lack of well-documented information on childhood overweight or obesity in Nepal. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence and associated factors of childhood overweight/obesity among urban primary school children.A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to October of 2017. Behavioral data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire with parents of children aged 6-13 years old in grades 1-5 studying in private schools of Lalitpur district in Nepal. Study participants were selected using two-stage cluster random sampling from 10 private schools. Height and weight measurements of 575 children were taken and BMI-for-age-sex was calculated using WHO AnthroPlus. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21. Associated factors were examined using Chi-square tests followed by multivariate logistic regression analyses.The study found that out of 575 students, 107 (18.6%) were overweight and 41 (7.1%) were obese. Among 328 male children, 62 (19.0%) were overweight and 35 (10.6%) were obese. Likewise, among 247 female children, 45 (18.2%) were overweight and 6 (2.4%) were obese. Male children (aOR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.38-3.53), children of mothers with a high school (aOR = 3.13, 95% CI: 1.39-7.12) or university level of education (aOR = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.23-7.70) and children of mothers in a professional field (aOR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.02-4.05) had a greater likelihood of being overweight/obese. Likewise, students consuming energy-dense less nutrient food (aOR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.66-5.12), lacking active travel to and from school (aOR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.12-4.79) and those having sedentary behaviors (aOR = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.20-7.29) were likely to be overweight/obese.More than one-quarter of the children in urban Lalitpur were found to be overweight/obese. High junk food consumption and sedentary activity were found to be significantly associated with childhood overweight/obesity. School health and awareness programs aiming to reduce the intake of energy-dense foods and promote an active lifestyle including active transportation to school among children are imperative.

When considering the importance of using LULC change as a window to study the broader changes in socio-ecological systems of this valley, our study first detected LULC change trajectories of this valley using four Landsat images of the year 1989, 1999, 2009, and 2016, and then analyzed the detected change in the light of a set of proximate causes and factors driving those changes. A pixel-based hybrid classification (unsupervised followed by supervised) approach was employed to classify these images into five LULC categories and analyze the LULC trajectories detected from them. Our results show that urban area expanded up to 412% in last three decades and the most of this expansion occurred with the conversions of 31% agricultural land. The majority of the urban expansion happened during 1989–2009, and it is still growing along the major roads in a concentric pattern, significantly altering the cityscape of the valley. The centrality feature of Kathmandu valley and the massive surge in rural-to-urban migration are identified as the primary proximate causes of the fast expansion of built-up areas and rapid conversions of agricultural areas.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/4/4/72/pdf,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Still they are not free of limitations. Operator’s technique, extreme temperatures, humidity, patients’ medication, hematocrit values can affect the reliability of glucose meter results. Hence, the accuracy of glucose meter has been the topic of concern since years. Therefore, present study aims to evaluate the analytical and clinical accuracy of glucose meter using International Organization for Standardization 15197 guideline. Methods: A community based descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Kapan, Kathmandu, Nepal in April 2018. Glucose levels were measured using glucose meter and reference laboratory method simultaneously among 203 adults ≥20 years, after an overnight fasting and two hours of ingestion of 75 grams glucose. Modified Bland-Altman plots were created by incorporating ISO 15197 guidelines to check the analytical accuracy and Park error grid was used to evaluate the clinical accuracy of the device. Results: Modified Bland-Altman plots showed>95% of the test results were beyond the acceptable analytical criteria of ISO 15197:2003 and 2013.

Besides, it observes intricacies of language contact and choice, power and status of language groups, and sociolinguistic situation. For this, observation and interpretative method of qualitative research were employed, 150 photographs were purposively snapped from five urban spaces in two month time. The signs were analyzed, compared and contrasted using a thematic approach with relevant theoretical backup. The finding revealed that the choice of language on signs bases on sign writer’s skill, presumed reader and symbolic value (Spolsky & Cooper, 1991). The study explored that the majority of urban linguistic landscapes are occupied by English signs, and English imperialism is a greater challenge for Nepali and vernacular languages.

However, rapid urban expansion and overpopulation have resulted not only in water shortage but ended up polluting the same water body based on which the settlements had grown, a classic example can be taken as that of Kathmandu and other surrounding cities in Kathmandu Valley. Due to resource availability and centralized government system, many people have migrated to the Kathmandu in recent decades. The annual population growth rate in the valley is 4.63% (CBS 2011) which has created haphazard urbanization resulting in water supply challenges. Geologically, Kathmandu Valley is an intermountain bowl-shaped basin comprised of both shallow and deep aquifers composed of fluvio-lacustrine sediments. Sandy gravel layers of northern side of the valley are considered the recharge zone due to the presence of unconsolidated coarse-grained deposits. Unfortunately, the area has the fastest urban growth and surface sealing, resulting in decrease in natural infiltration. Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL), the only one organization facilitated by the government, provides approximately 25–33% of the total demand of 350 MLD. Analyses have shown that there will not be water shortage between 2023 and 2025 if the Melamchi Water supply Project (MWSP) is completed within the allocated time. However, even that would not quench the thirst of the people as the demand is expected to rise in coming years. Proper planning, good governance, identification of water sources, and water treatment of wastewater are the long-term solutions for sufficient water supply. Alternate mitigation options, such as proper use of groundwater and surface water and spring water management with appropriate distribution system, would be useful. Unless the problem is tackled tactfully from different aspects and not only from demand supply and soon, the increasing social conflicts could be challenging for the planners in the future.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-981-10-8947-3_11,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Imminent water crisis due to climate change, water demanding nature of traditionally cultivated rice, increasing scarcity of labor and escalating labor costs drive the search for alternative management methods to increase water productivity, system sustainability and profitability in rice cultivation. Direct seeded rice (DSR) technique has received much attention and popularity nowadays because of its low-input demanding nature that can mitigate emission of green-house gases and adaption to climatic risks. DSR involves sowing of dry seed into a prepared seedbed, pre-germinated seed into a puddled soil surface and standing water. The development of early maturing varieties and use of efficient nutrient management practices along with increased adoption of integrated weed management techniques have encouraged many farmers to switch from transplanted to DSR culture. DSR technology is highly mechanized in some developed countries like USA, Australia, Japan, China, Korea etc. This shift from traditional rice to DSR will substantially reduce crop water requirements, soil organic-matter turnover, enhanced nutrient management, carbon sequestration, weed management, greenhouse-gas emissions and enhance crop intensification. However, weed and nematode infestation, blast, panicle sterility, lack of suitable varieties for DSR and lodging are major challenges. Based on existing evidences, this paper reviews the integrated package of technologies for DSR, potential advantages and challenges associated with it.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44786/33689,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 385 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics of Gandaki Medical College starting from May 2021 to July 2021, by using self- administered questionnaire. The data was analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences version 21.0 and descriptive statistics were computed. Results: More than four‐fifths respondents were aware about COVID‐19. Half of them thought it transmits via human touch. One-fourth of them mentioned that delivery at the hospital during COVID-19 pandemic was unsafe. Almost half of them regretted conceiving, among which one quarter thought of aborting their fetus, half of them were against breastfeeding, and three-forth had regular antenatal care checkups. Majority of them took precautions to stay safe, where half of them responded that they would not breast fed baby if they got infected. Conclusions: Majority of the study population have good knowledge, attitude, and practice of COVID-19 disease. However, it is worrisome that some respondents thought of terminating her pregnancy, and some were unable to visit the hospital for routine antenatal care checkups and didn’t have proper knowledge about breastfeeding their child.

This study has attempted to attain the cross-sectional analysis of Kathmandu valley that has been plagued by rampant urbanization over the last three decades. The research utilizes Landsat images of Kathmandu valley from 1976 to 2015 for the transition analysis of land use, land cover and urban sprawl for the last four decades. Results showed that the urban coverage of Kathmandu valley has tremendously increased from 20.19 km2 in 1976 to 39.47 km2 in 1989 to 78.96 km2 in 2002 to 139.57 km2 in 2015, at the cost of cultivated lands, with an average annual urban growth rate of 7.34%, 7.70% and 5.90% in each temporal interval, respectively. In addition, the urban expansion orientation analysis concludes the significant urban concentration in the eastern part, moderately medium in the southwest and relatively less in the western and northwest part of the valley. Urbanization was solely accountable for the exploitation of extant forests, fertile and arable lands and indigenous and cultural landscapes. Unattended fallow lands in suburban areas have compounded the problem by welcoming invasive alien species. Overlaying the highly affected geological formations within the major city centers displays that unless the trend of rapid, unplanned urbanization is discontinued, the future of Kathmandu is at the high risk.

For the specific overtime analysis of change, the LULC transition was clustered into six time periods: 1988–1996, 1996–2000, 2000–2004, 2004–2008, 2008–2013, and 2013–2016. The classification was carried out using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and 11 LULC categories were identified. The classified images were further used to predict LULC change scenarios for 2025 and 2035 using the hybrid cellular automata Markov chain (CA-Markov) model. Major hazard risk areas were identified using available databases, satellite images, literature surveys, and field observations. Extensive field visits were carried out for ground truth data acquisition to verify the LULC maps and identify multihazard risk areas. The overall classification accuracy of the LULC map for each year was observed to be from 85% to 93%. We explored the remarkable increase in urban/built-up areas from 24.06 km2 in 1988 to 60.74 km2 by 2016. A majority of urban/built-up areas were sourced from cultivated land. For the six time periods, totals of 91.04%, 78.68%, 75.90%, 90.44%, 92.35%, and 99.46% of the newly expanded urban land were sourced from cultivated land. Various settlements within and away from the city of Pokhara and cultivated land at the river banks were found at risk. A fragile geological setting, unstable slopes, high precipitation, dense settlement, rampant urbanization, and discrete LULC change are primarily accountable for the increased susceptibility to hazards. The predicted results showed that the urban area is likely to continue to grow by 2025 and 2035. Despite the significant transformation of LULC and the prevalence of multiple hazards, no previous studies have undertaken a long-term time-series and simulation of the LULC scenario.

Thus, visibility is commonly considered a proxy for ambient air quality. The long-term trend of visibility may reflect the change in the air quality of a place over the period. In our study, we have analyzed historic climatological data (1977-2020) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) global hourly archive, for the two cities of west Nepal, namely, Bhairahawa (BWA, 27.506 °N, 83.416 °E) and Surkhet (SKH, 28.6 °N, and 81.617 °E). We have found that both of the synoptic stations exhibited persistent degraded visibility. BWA had poorer visibility conditions (poor air quality) than that of SKH since the beginning of the study period. Since 2014, the ‘annual good day’ (V ≥ 10 km ) at BWA is steadily near 0%, and the ‘annual bad day’ (V < 5 km) is ≈ 60%, suggesting a degraded air quality. Similarly, we observed a notable decline in the 50th percentile of visibility in the mid-1980s at SKH, and a sharp decline of ‘good day’ since 2011. Meteorology modifies the optical properties of aerosol/ gaseous in the atmosphere, thereby, resulting in a change in visibility. In our study, we have investigated the influence of relative humidity (RH) on prevailing visibility. Although the relationship between them exists in both of the stations, it is more distinctly visible at BWA. We observed lower visibility conditions (V ≤ 3 km) occurring at an RH level as low as 50% at BWA. This indicates an abundance of specific hygroscopic aerosols, whose light extinction thresholds are as low. At BWA, the impact of RH is evident during the dry season. In contrast, the threshold value of RH is quite high (80%) at SKH and the relationship is prominent during the wet season. This alarmingly poor air quality at both stations requires a serious concern because of its adverse impact on various sectors like aviation, tourism, and public health.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNPhysSoc/article/download/48287/36084,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

To ensure the data's suitability for factor analysis using Principal Component Analysis, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, Bartlett's Sphericity test, inter-component correlations, and Cronbach alpha scores for internal consistency were checked, and principal components were extracted. A 25-item safety barrier to safety measures in building construction projects during the COVID-19 pandemic was identified through an extensive review of the literature; six components were retained using Principal Component Analysis which represented the model of choice and explained 62.86 % of the data variance. The components were; inappropriate safety guidelines, psychological working pressure, inadequate hygiene monitoring and control, lack of safety awareness, improper working culture, and insufficient planning and scheduling. The internal consistency for the retained components was high; Cronbach α scores ranged from 0.72 to 0.796. “Inappropriate Safety Guidelines” was the most critical barrier to implementing safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in building construction projects, according to the rankings of the six identified components. It is recommended that construction professionals and regulatory bodies prioritize the development and adherence to robust safety protocols tailored to pandemic conditions.

Despite this, only 10% of women have ever been tested and received the results. The objective of the study is to examine the impact of mass media exposure in getting HIV testing among urban women in Nepal. <h3>Methods</h3> The study is based on 12,862 women aged 15–49 residing in Nepal and enrolled in NDHS 2016. All urban women were asked the frequency of exposure to media. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to study the effect of radio, television and internet exposure in getting HIV testing among women in Nepal. <h3>Results</h3> Among women exposed to radio, television and internet have 12.6%, 12.6% and 18.6% HIV testing respectively than those without radio (9.9%), television (8.1%) and internet (8.3%). (P value &lt;0.001). Women exposed to radio, television and internet at least once a week were more likely to have HIV testing then those not exposed. Women who used the internet every day had high HIV testing (19.4%, CI 18.9 to 19.8) in comparison to those listened radio every day (13.6%, CI 13.1 to 14.0) and watch television every day (14.1%, CI 13.7 to 14.5). Using binary logistic regression analysis, odds of women exposed to radio, television and internet were 1.2, 1.5 and 2.5 times respectively more likely to have HIV testing than those not exposed (P value &lt;0.001). <h3>Conclusion</h3> Urban women exposure to internet has high impact in getting HIV test in Nepal. Internet plays a crucial role as a source of information for urban women in getting HIV testing in comparison to radio and television. The Ministry of Health, and International Development Partners should develop the intervention such as mobile apps, website as information source as more women are using mobile phone and internet in Nepal. <h3>Disclosure</h3> No significant relationships.",https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1136/sextrans-2019-sti.243,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

This study in the city of Pokhara, Nepal, explored Dalit identity using two rounds of focus group discussions involving a total of 23 individuals drawn from a range of Dalit caste groups with a variety of livelihoods. The results describe the caste-based discrimination experienced by the participants and the different strategies they employ to either reinvent themselves by changing names; or embracing their caste-heritage and taking advantage of affirmative action programmes. Whilst urban migration can provide some relief from discrimination, the study reveals that caste still remains prominent in the lives of Dalits in Pokhara.

Compared to foreign direct investment (FDI) or foreign aid (grants & loans), the money injected to the economy of Nepal through remittances is markedly larger. Huge investment in the real estate sector and large sums of money applied for share subscription indicate the need and opportunities of channelizing remittances in the infrastructure development and productive sector. However, most studies on remittances are focused on the ex-post analysis of the economy and few studies focus on the planning and policy issues aimed to utilize remittances. This paper reviews literature on utilizing remittance money and analyzes the prospects of capitalizing remittances in Nepal. A conceptual model is proposed on utilizing remittance money for infrastructure development. The proposed model of a remittance investment trust aims to synergize the three best attributes of the three domains of stakeholders, namely, abundant remittance money of the people, excellent management skills of the private sector, and the superior public trust to the government. Remittance money can serve as a great investment vehicle for executing properly investigated and attractive infrastructure projects. As estimated for Lumbini province, the remittance investment trust may contribute to fulfill 20% of the deficit of investment towards achieving the sustainable development goals. While the model is proposed for a province, it is expected to be replicable to the national and sub-national governments in Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/55075/42217,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

This study specifically addresses this issue by investigating evolving spatial interactions between natural hazards, ever-increasing urban areas, and social vulnerability in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. The methodology used in this work considers: (1) the characterization of flood hazard and liquefaction susceptibility using pre-existing global models; (2) the simulation of future urban built-up areas using the cellular-automata SLEUTH (Slope, Land use, Excluded areas, Urban extent, Transportation, Hillshade) model, which requires satellite imagery for statistical calibration and validation; and (3) the assessment of social vulnerability using a social vulnerability index tailored for the case-study area. Results show that the total built-up area in Kathmandu will increase to 352 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by 2050, which is effectively double the equivalent 2018 figure of 177 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The most socially vulnerable villages will account for 29% of the total built-up area in 2050, which is 11% more than their current proportion. Built-up areas in the 100-year and 1000-year return period floodplains will respectively increase from 38 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 49 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; today to 83 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 108 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;in 2050.

Urban rural temperature and humidity difference i.e. Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Urban Dry Island (UDI) respectively have been reported for cities and regions worldwide, mostly with local field sites that are extremely diverse in their physical and climatological characteristics. Generally, the UHI study relies on simplistic descriptors such as “urban” and “rural”. While these descriptors may be evocative of the landscape, they are insufficient in providing information like its site properties which have direct impacts on the surface layer climate. To fulfil the gap and for the clarity “local climate zone” (LCZ) classification is a very good tool. Each classification is unique in its combination of surface structure, cover, and human activity. The standard framework for each zone helps to classify an area for reporting and comparing field sites and their temperature observations. The LCZ not only helps in UHI and UDI study but also helps in planning smart environment and human friendly cities, landscape, and global climate change investigation. Nepal now being a federal state, many states having smart developmental drive of cities focusing only on physical infrastructure without considering UHI effect must incorporate study of cities by LCZ for sustainable urbanization.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/kjem/article/download/61867/46561,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Nevertheless, urban areas still support approximately 20% of the world's bird population. In Nepal, urbanization has been rapidly increasing in recent decades, yet little attention has been paid to urban biodiversity exacerbating the impact of urban expansion on threatened birds. In this perspective article, we explore studies on urban birds in Nepal to identify existing research patterns, discuss what has been known, outline gaps and pave immediate future interventions in studies of avian urban ecology in Nepal. There has been a significantly lower number of studies on urban birds in Nepal compared to neighbouring India and China in the last 10 years. Studies of urban birds in Nepal are at a very early stage focused on the diversity and richness in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Butwal with no baseline data for other major cities. Our understanding of bird homogenization or extinction as well as the effects of birds on cities, such as their rapid colonization and potential role as pests, may be limited by this dearth of knowledge about urban birds and biodiversity. Therefore, we have outlined future research opportunities in avian urban ecology in Nepal such as long-term bird surveys, interdisciplinary field of studies, diseases study, management of urban green spaces, avian adaptation to urban environments, colonization and extinction patterns in cities, and conflicts, challenges, and management strategies related to urban avian ecology. With this article, we call the immediate attention of scientists, urban planners, and related stakeholders to use birds as a model system to study urban environments which could be a good start in building a bird-friendly city.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/njz/article/download/60810/45565,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Given that BRI infrastructures materialize in parallel with Chinese-funded reconstruction projects, we pay attention to the role of post-disaster politics to unravel how ongoing urban transformation does not only affect the present and the future but also people's histories and post-disaster memories by treating places of (re)building as empty of previous life and history. By drawing on 16 months of fieldwork, we show that despite the evident role of the BRI as an agent of urban transformation, the materialization of most BRI projects depends on geopolitical rivalries, negotiations, unstable local coalitions and escalating social contestation. We conclude that in the post-disaster era, BRI projects have become new vehicles towards Naya [new] Nepal, along with many other infrastructural myths that preceded the country's modern history. Nonetheless, the Naya urban Nepal that is emerging from the ruins of the past is contested and uncertain, a far cry from the days of the Panchayat regime and the civil war, when such gargantuan projects were rarely challenged by Nepali people. This is the unique trajectory of Silk Road urbanization in Nepal: an ultimate path to reach a long due rural-to-urban transition that is inextricably linked with decades of infrastructural violence and precarity and strongly shaped by people's struggles against the unequal geographies of BRI-driven urban transformation.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0962629822001184,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

The nutritional status of adolescents being shaped by socio-cultural, environmental, and economic factors has also been impacted by their food habits and level of physical activity. The current nutritional shift and rapid urbanization had emerged overweight as an additional burden for consistently prevalent undernutrition issues. So, the study aimed to identify the prevalence of and risk factors for overweight among school adolescents. Methods A school-based cross-sectional analytical study was carried out among school adolescents in a Sub-metropolitan city of Nepal. A random sample of 279 adolescents from nine schools was included in the study. The anthropometric measurement of the height and the weight were measured as per the standard. The odds ratio with a 95% CI was calculated and a p-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered as cut off for statistical significance by fitting into the final multivariable logistic regression. Results The overall prevalence of overweight was obtained as 9.31% (95% CI: 6.40 − 13.3). The mean age of respondents was 15.5 years. The early aged adolescents were more overweight than compared to middle-aged adolescents (AOR: 0.27, CI: 0.028–2.67) and late adolescents (AOR: 0.66, CI: 0.068–6.44) respectively. Similarly, adolescents residing in rural areas had 0.35 (AOR = 0.33, CI: 0.030–3.71) odds of being overweight compared to their counterparts.

The foundation of this study is based on five key primary questions in the thematic area of “plant-health relationship for subjective wellbeing in later life of retirees”. This study involved fifteen participants: four women and eleven men aged 60-80 years who were retired from 20 to 40 years of service in governmental, semi-, and non-governmental organizations. They were living with their families and had fairly similar physical and cognitive abilities. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed using the descriptive phenomenological method. Retired professionals from different sectors (education, police force, banking, agriculture, Army, engineering, nursing, community development, etc.) were found to be active, having a good understanding of plants and their relationship to human wellbeing. Most of them spent more than three hours daily in their horticultural activities (like kitchen gardening, rooftop gardening, terrace gardening, lawn or indoor plants). They utilized their competence and experiences gained from parents and ancestors, keeping themselves busy and productive after retirement.

The findings of the study clearly revealed that climate change and its associated impacts on the lives of people have further exacerbated the existing inequalities among the social groups – the access to drinking water for the marginalized social groups further declined because of drying of water sources and other disasters affecting the availability of water. Based on these empirical facts, this chapter highlights the need to develop an interdisciplinary approach to advance a research and policy agenda on climate justice and disaster risk management (with valuable insights from elsewhere). We conclude that a climate justice framework is needed in the context of Nepal that considers distributional, capabilities, procedural, and recognition issues and aspects of vulnerability, resilience, and adaptive capacity.

Nepal matters because it is in such spaces where fertile agricultural land is disappearing and houses are being built. This chapter argues that Nepalese urban planning efforts are highly dependent on the local authorities' relationships with elites in different parts of the city. From 2002 to 2017, a central government with non-elected officials espoused informality, while after 2018 a federal government with newly elected local government officials is adopting incrementalism as an urban planning logic. By utilising the concepts of informality, incrementalism and learning, a space is opened to think and consider the limits of knowledge and power of the local authority. The following questions are raised: For how long will the rural areas and their elites be allowed to circumvent urban planning laws?

So, ownership of land has multi-faceted understanding around the world. For the developing country like Nepal having diverse societal arrangements, land tenure system plays important role in economic, social and political structure. As Nepal is in the process of implementing federalization, assessment of land tenure security shall be one of the instruments for developing new land related policies and assessing the effect of new policies afterward. The objective of this paper is to perform SWOT analysis on the status of land tenure security in Nepal by reviewing the history of the tenure system and current tenure system, studying country reports and research papers and analyzing policies and institutions. The study shows that despite some initiatives by government, NGOs, bilateral agencies and media to improve land tenure security, land tenure insecurity prevails in all areas of the country even in registered lands. It is found that stable  rganization, registration of most of the built-up and cultivated land, advocacy to protect the right of landless has strengthened the land tenure security. However, the tenure rights of socially and economically disadvantaged people and displaced people from disasters have not been properly addressed and those people are at high risk of eviction from the place they are living. The study recommends that land tenure insecurity arising from political, legislative and organizational behavior should be managed by appropriate interventions and policy reforms. As most of the analyses of land tenure security in Nepal have been performed in a descriptive way, this study explicitly investigates the issue through SWOT analysis.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJG/article/download/23005/19537,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Here we describe an approach to systematically map the single hazards and multi-hazard interrelationships that have a potential to impact Kathmandu, Nepal, one of the focus cities of the UK Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) Tomorrow&amp;#8217;s Cities research hub. Using an existing classification of 21 natural hazard types (across six hazard groups: geophysical, hydrological, atmospheric, biological, space), we first searched for evidence of each of these occurring in or affecting Kathmandu. We used systematic mapping to find and select evidence, applying a simple Boolean search with keywords and reviewing publications across all years available on online databases before selecting evidence from 2010 onwards where available. The spatial boundary around Kathmandu was not specified, rather we chose evidence based on recorded or potential impacts in the city. When searches returned many results (i.e., over 100), we skimmed titles and abstracts for spatial and temporal occurrence to select up to 5 sources. We examined and integrated evidence from diverse sources, including academic literature, grey literature, traditional media (e.g., English language Nepali newspapers), global and national disaster databases and social media. This evidence was then used to assess potential multi-hazard interrelationships that may occur in Kathmandu. Using this blended evidence, we found 21 single hazard types that might impact Kathmandu. We found case study evidence for 11 interrelationship types that have had previous impact in Kathmandu with many more that are theoretically possible. The results illustrate the complexity of the hazard landscape, with many single hazards and multi-hazard interrelationships potentially impacting Kathmandu. This knowledge can inform the development of dynamic risk scenarios, to use in planning and civil protection, thus strengthening multi-hazard approaches to disaster risk reduction in Kathmandu.&lt;/p&gt;",,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

At present load shedding is being managed by significant import of electricity from India thus increasing trade deficit of Nepal. The accelerated alternative methods of generation of electricity in Nepal need to be explored. This paper assesses the potential of rooftop solar Photovoltaic (PV) system in residential buildings in their major cities namely Kathmandu valley, Pokhara and Biratnagar of Nepal. The data indicated in this paper are collected from the predefined set of questionnaire and field survey in the randomly sampled households in 2016. Form the quantitative analysis of the data, it is found that the average roof top area available for PV installation in residential buildings are 14.5 sq.m, 12.45 sq.m and 19 sq.m for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Biratnagar cities respectively. Considering 557,027 residential buildings in Kathmandu; 77,523 in Pokhara and 33,075 in Biratnagar, total PV power potential is estimated to be 810 MWp, 96.5 MWp and 63.5 MWp in respective cities. To estimate the energy potential the annual average peaksun hours considered are 5.54, 5.58 and 5.13 for Kathmandu, Pokhara and Biratnagar city respectively, data taken from Solar and Wind Resource Assessment (SWERA) report. The total power potential in all three cities is found to be 970 MWp which could generate 1,310 GWh that comes out to be 24% of the electricity sold by Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) in fiscal year 2017/18. If shade free roof top space available of the 50% residential buildings are utilized for PV installation (333,762 numbers), about 12% of the Nepal’s utility electricity sold in the fiscal year 2017/18 could be saved annually. The technical barriers for the grid connection of roof top solar is not a major issue now as NEA has set the guidelines for it.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JIE/article/download/32199/25456,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

The PV systems were installed on the rooftop of the Nepal Telecom office at Sundhara, Pokhara, and Biratnagar. The generation data was collected through the web interface of the data logger installed at the sites. Long-term comparison (four years) of the plant at Sundhara and the same system comparison of plants at Pokhara and Biratnagar were performed. Long-term analysis of the plant at Sundhara found that the final yield decreased from 2.91 kWh/kWp in 2019 to 2.21 kWh/kWp in 2022. Similarly, the performance ratio decreased from 91.0% in 2019 to 67.3% in 2022, capacity utilization factor decreased from 12.1% in 2019 to 9.2% in 2022, and system efficiency decreased from 16.8% in 2019 to 12.5% in 2022.  The same system installed at Pokhara and Biratnagar had slightly varied performance owing to the variation in meteorological parameters. The average air temperature at Biratnagar (26.7°C) was higher than at Pokhara (13.1°C) while the amount of solar radiation at Biratnagar was just higher by 4%. This led to the reduction of final yield by 9% at Biratnagar than at Pokhara as higher temperatures at Biratnagar caused more reduction in the power output from the solar panels.

Population growth and improved road accessibility has led to increased construction and an expansion and alteration of the built environment. The growing availability of modern construction materials like concrete and steel allows for new architectural designs and the erection of additional storeys on existing buildings, which contributes to the instability of the building stock. The aftermath of the April 2015 Gorkha Earthquake demonstrates the severe consequences of such haphazard construction practices in seismically active locations. A lack of implementation and enforcement of regulatory frameworks for building construction and spatial planning raises the risks for the local population. Taking Musikot as a characteristic case study of rapid urban change, this article analyses it’s increasing local earthquake-risk in light of insufficient seismic building code implementation and risk-sensitive urban planning. Applying an approach that combines repeat photography and field mapping, the urban development of Musikot and the increasing fragility of the building stock are assessed using a modified seismic evaluation scheme for local building types. Almost one fourth of all construction was found to be at high risk of damage to earthquakes. It is argued, that without proper training in earthquake resistant construction techniques and awareness campaigns, the (mal-)adoption of modern construction materials will amplify earthquake risk in rural centres.

This study was undertaken to compare the vitamin D status in urban and rural population of South India among pregnant women and their newborns.Material and Methods: Ninety one pregnant women and their newborns (46 urban and 45 rural) were recruited. Maternal Vitamin D levels and serum concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and Vitamin D were measured in the cord blood.Results: Eighty two (90%) of the pregnant women, 38 from rural and 44 from urban, had vitamin D deficiency. However, the mean vitamin D levels were low in urban (9.42 ± 12.2) compared to rural women (35.86 ± 16.3,p=0.037).Hypovitaminosis D was noted in 88% of the newborns, deficiency being more in neonates born to urban women. Though the dietary calcium intake was uniformly low, it was lower in rural (960.1 ± 139.9 mg/d) Vs urban mothers (1060.1 ± 150.6 mg/d, p< 0.001). Urban mothers were found to be exposed to sun for lower duration of 0.3 hours compared to rural mothers 0.5 hours. Similarly the surface area of body exposed to sun was lower in urban mothers (7.5%) compared to rural mothers (15%, p=0.0001). A moderate positive correlation between mother-neonate pair was noted.Conclusions: The magnitude of Hypovitaminosis D observed among pregnant women and their newborn warrants public health intervention in terms of vitamin D supplementations during pregnancy.J Nepal Paediatr Soc 2016;36(3):243-249",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNPS/article/download/15156/13932,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Municipal authorities of burgeoning peri-urban areas in the lower Himalaya region are struggling to deal with the new geographies of water demand. Rapidly growing towns primarily access water from upstream rural water sources, while upstream communities themselves are increasing their water consumption as they gradually integrate in the peri-urban area themselves. This ‘reorganization’ of water has intensified contestation between upstream rural communities and downstream urban authorities. This paper examines the different narratives mobilized in the contestation of water transfer projects to the rapidly growing town of Dhulikhel in Nepal. Our analysis deploys Follman’s three perspectives on peri-urbanity to throw light on these discourses. From a transitional perspective, it shows how peri-urbanization heightens water demands across the peri-urban zone and heightens competition between water users. A territorial perspective questions the administrative subdivision of the peri-urban region, and its effects on the way water users envision water sharing as restricted within territorial boundaries. Finally, a third, functional perspective reveals how in more rural municipalities, the traditional rural character is emphasized to claim priority in the access to water, thereby giving rise to a divisive identity politics. From this analysis, we argue that peri-urbanization is a dynamic process shaped not merely by urban expansion, but by the interactions between rural and urban communities and functions. While increasingly integrated, peri-urban territories, by intensifying competition for resources, are also a fertile ground for a re-assertion of rural identities and rural-urban binaries.",,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

This study examines the effects of UHI by comparing normalized Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Kathmandu Valley and assessing the influence of land use changes on UHI intensity between 1990 and 2021. The result shows that built-up area has expanded by 30.7% of the total area, while the agricultural area has decreased by 33.59%.

Therefore, this study examined school-based ECE programs compared with independent ECE programs in an urban region in Nepal. The study employed weighting estimation approaches, using unique cross-sectional data of 652 children (483 children from 138 school-based programs and 169 children from 50 independent programs) aged four years from the Lalitpur municipality. The study found that, relative to independent programs, school-based programs are negatively associated with children's development, particularly in the cognitive and socio-emotional domains. The mean differences in these outcomes remained statistically significant with medium effect sizes (d = 0.31–0.43) even after accounting for available confounders. The results also suggest that lower levels of classroom structural quality, such as teacher's education, class size, and learning resources, may partially account for the lower developmental outcomes of school-based programs compared to independent programs. Practice or Policy: The findings highlight the need for stakeholders to focus on improving the quality of school-based ECE programs to address inequity in the current ECE system in Nepal.

With the demand for fire services increasing due to rapid growth in population and infrastructure development, the limited number of fire stations, insufficient human and physical resources, poor street connectivity, narrow streets, and delays in response to calls for emergency services have resulted in significant property loss, environmental impact, serious injuries, and even loss of life. Although a substantial body of research exists on understanding fire patterns and fire station site selection in developed countries, there is a noticeable lack of similar research in developing countries, which can be attributed to a lack of available data and interest. This study utilises ward-level urban fire incident data in Kathmandu from July 2019 to February 2023 to examine the spatial pattern of fire risk, fire service coverage and identify potential sites for fire stations. Results reveal a significantly higher fire rate in the central part of the city. Fire rescue service cannot reach most areas in Kathmandu within 5 min, with some areas exceeding 10 min response time.

As most of the cities in Nepal have been growing haphazardly, the cities lack sufficient open space. However, the value of open space in dense cities like Kathmandu has been recognized more after the Gorkha Earthquake 2015 as the open spaces were extensively used for risk relief, treatment, recovery, and rehabilitation during and after the earthquake.

The concept of urban governance and water security is inextricably tied as the need of improved water services historically grew with the expansion of cities calling for critical governance arrangements. In light of the above, this paper examines the existing state of water security in Dhulikhel. By examining the power relations between ‘fringe’ and the ‘core’ areas, the paper depicts the growing inequity across the 9 wards of Dhulikhel pertaining to water access and distribution based on caste, class, ethnicity and gender. Two fundamental questions that guide this paper are: 1) Why disparities exist between the core and fringe categories in Dhulikhel Municipality? 2) How does the core-fringe category shape the power of communities in the water governance? The findings clearly show that there is a huge discrimination between the core and the fringe, the poor and the non-poor within the core in water availability, distribution and decision making. Establishing an equitable water justice system calls for uprooting the existing social discrimination in water security to empower the fringe communities.",https://newangle.sias-southasia.org/index.php/new/article/download/10/8,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

The major aims were to study, quantify, and understand the concentrations and variations of TSP and major water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) in the valley with limited data. The annual average TSP mass concentration was 135.50 ± 62.91 µg/m3. The average analyzed total WSIIs accounted for 14.4% of total TSP mass. Major anions and cations in TSP samples were SO42− and Ca2+, respectively. Seasonal differences in atmospheric conditions explain the clear seasonal variations of ions, with higher concentrations during pre-monsoon and winter and lower concentrations during the monsoon period. Neutralization factor calculations suggested that Ca2+ in the Pokhara valley mostly neutralizes the acidity in the atmosphere. Principle component analysis, NO3−/SO42− ratio, and non-sea salt fraction calculations suggested that the WSIIs in the valley were mostly derived from anthropogenic activities and crustal mineral dust, which was also supported by the results from precipitation chemistry over the central Himalayas, Nepal. In addition, back trajectories analysis has suggested that the air pollution transported from and through Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) during the dry periods, which has resulted in high ionic loadings during this period. Average NO3−/SO42− ratio was found to be 0.69, indicating the dominance of stationary sources of TSP in Pokhara valley.

Agricultural activities contribute directly to emissions of greenhouse gases through a variety of processes including the source categories such as enteric fermentation in domestic livestock, livestock manure management, rice cultivation, and agricultural soil management. Diverse traditional agriculture systems, unique diversities in land types and unavailability of required disaggregated data at the national level as defined by the emission factor data base (EFDB) of the IPCC 2006, were the problem encountered while calculating the emission status in this study.

One third of GDP comes from agriculture and there are numerous opportunities in agriculture mainly because of varied agro-climate prevailed in the country. Niche specific commodities that have comparative advantage could be produced in fair quantity to meet the demand of huge market of neighboring India and China as purchasing capacity of people in those countries has improved markedly mainly for quality agriculture commodities. Trade deficit, food insecurity, income generation, poverty reduction, and employment generation could be addressed by turning present status of subsistence agriculture into robust, vibrant and commercial agriculture through technology led agro-industrialization. There are agro-commodities which are imported from India and other countries in huge quantity by the scarce hard currency earned through remittance. Evidence shows that almost 70% of the remittance is spent for agriculture commodities which have high potentiality to produce within the country even after local consumption. Such produce could be exported to other countries to mitigate trade imbalance, enhance export promotion and import reduction and promote graduating Nepal from LDC to DC within the stipulated time frame as proposed a couple of years ago by the government of Nepal. Nepal should come up with functional, pragmatic and implementable agriculture plan and policy to harness huge possibility of agriculture commercialization to meet the consumption demand per se within and outside the country. This paper highlights to address prospects and limitations of agriculture commercialization and suggests some way forward to make agriculture more vibrant and robust to address trade deficit, food and nutritional insecurity and livelihood enhancement of Nepalese as a whole thereby Nepal can tailor her pace of development with neighboring countries to meet the aspiration of Nepalese in the 21st century.Agronomy Journal of Nepal (Agron JN) vol. 4, 2016, Page: 38-63",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/15515/12519,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

This paper aims to analyze the constraints and opportunities of vegetable farmers in Kirtipur. Altogether 80 farm household survey were conducted in four major areas of Kirtipur. A total of 20 key informant interviews (KII) were also conducted to understand the perception of farm households on commercial vegetable farming. The result shows that around 94% of the total sampled farm households have leasehold farmland that has spread to different settlements of Kirtipur Municipality. Out of total leasehold farmers, 69% have written agreement with the landowner. The result also shows that the farmers cultivate vegetables in an average area of 5.67 ropani (2884.49m2). Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) are the primary vegetable products, whereas cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) and other green leafy vegetables are mostly cultivated as secondary vegetable products. Dug wells are the major sources of irrigation on vegetable farmland. Out of the total sampled farm households, about 42% of farmers are associated with farmers group and 37% have basic training on vegetable farming. Majority of farmers have savings from vegetable production and marketing. Despite few constraints like price fluctuation (81%) and high middleman margins (71%), vegetable farming in Kirtipur has many opportunities particularly being a major source income and livelihood (93%), self-employment generation (87%) and growing market demand (83%). The opportunities in commercial vegetable farming have continuously attracted the farmers in Kirtipur; however, the existing constraints has deprived farmers from their expected returns. Therefore, this paper recommends to portray possible options to promote opportunities and overcome the existing constraints to retain commercial vegetable farming as a sustainable source for farm households in Kirtipur.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23418/19847,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Although rivers have limited floodplains, floods have been increased because of floodplain encroachment, improper drainage, land use changes in upper catchment, and climate change. Although the earthquake could have a high impact, the seismicity is low compared to the national context. During pre- and monsoon seasons, windstorms have a high impact over a limited area and are hard to predict. Fires are not widespread in the settlements but common during hot, dry months due to compact rural settlements, nonresilient house designs, and inadequate safety measures. Besides, lack of adaptation capacity as a result of poor awareness, widespread poverty, and poor disaster response have contributed to a high vulnerability to multihazards. Mitigation actions identified include risk-sensitive land use planning, flood control and hydraulic structure design, efficient urban drainage, waste management, resilient housing, and disaster safety plans.

The government has been spending a significant portion of its budget on imports, and it aims to reduce this dependence by increasing domestic production and achieving food security goals. To understand the dynamics of this issue, system dynamics modelling steps were employed. The key variables considered in the model testing were domestic production, imports, per capita consumption, productivity per hectare, and average area expansion rate. The study utilized time series data from 1991 to 2020 and projected the analysis up to 2050 using Stella Architect, a computer-based software program. The findings reveal that both the population and imports have exhibited exponential growth over the years. The model also indicates goal-seeking behaviour, with the government setting targets for yield increment based on available harvest areas. However, the policies implemented thus far have mostly been quick-fix approaches focusing input subsidized programs. According to the model, an increase of 70-100% in rice production will be required by 2050 to meet the growing population's demand. The study presents three policy options for achieving rice self-sufficiency: 1) a 2% annual increase in average area expansion, 2) raising productivity from 3700 kg ha-1 to 5000 kg ha-1 and 3) increasing productivity to 3900 kg ha-1 while reducing per capita rice consumption from 200 kg to 130 kg. The study suggests that adopting the recommended policy implications can help increase rice production in Nepal. Decision-makers should adopt a dynamic approach to the rice production system to address the issue of slow growth and achieve national self-sufficiency and food security goals.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/62168/46954,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

The objective of this study was to identify land market impact factors in the context of the introduction of land use regulation in Nepal. Through a combination of desktop review and the incorporation of stakeholder perspectives, the paper presents a new approach for determining land market impact factors due to land use regulation where both generic and country issues are considered. A desktop review was carried out to identify a preliminary set of impact factors, which were reclassified through intuitive analysis based on the degree of thematic closeness. Perspective-based impact factors were identified through the qualitative analysis of primary data collected through semi-structured interviews with the Nepalese land market stakeholders. These independently derived impact factors were compared with the desktop literature review impact factors, resulting in 14 land market impact factors across four dimensions, including transaction cost, valuation, mortgage availability, taxation, and compensation across the economic dimension; lot size, subdivision restrictions, and coordination across the institutional dimension; awareness, expectation, and proximity across the social dimension; and risk reduction, quality of residential land, and suitability of zoning classification across the environmental dimension. There was significant overlap and commonality across factors identified from both the literature review and semi-structured interviews. The land market impact factors determined in this study may be adapted and generalized across other countries and could be utilized to better understand the impacts of land policy decisions on urban planning and development. Further research is recommended on the process to operationalize the use of these factors to quantify the impact of land use regulation on different land markets.",https://www.mdpi.com/2413-8851/8/2/58/pdf,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Using data from the third wave of the Household Risk and Vulnerability Survey 2018, logistic regression is employed to analyze both the likelihood of LPG adoption and household expenditure on LPG under conditions of natural shocks. The findings reveal that households experiencing natural shocks are 5 percent less on average likely to adopt biogas or LPG. Furthermore, household expenditure on LPG decreases by 4.43 percent relative to cooking fuel expenses particularly for firewood by the households experiencing natural shocks. This reduction highlights a decline in the intensity of clean energy use among households concurrently using LPG and firewood.

This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing an estimate for quarterly GDP for the period of 1997/98 Q1 to 2017/18 Q4 following well established Chow-Lin procedure. The quarterly exports and government tax revenue are used to extrapolate the magnitude and movement of quarterly GDP. The results show a deterministic seasonal movement over the quarters. In particular, increased economic activities are observed in the second and fourth quarters while making a comparison on quarter to quarter basis. It is expected that this paper will partially fulfill the gap of unavailability of quarterly GDP figures in the public domain, and documents that the researcher may use suitable econometric exercise to obtain inter-temporal disaggregation of low-frequency data such as annual GDP into quarterly figures.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/36036/28143,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

A questionnaire survey was conducted with construction team who are related to the project. For the case study of the project, contract documents were obtained from the related offices which were thoroughly studied to obtain the project related findings about variation orders relating to project cost and completion time. Five ranking linkert scale have been used for ranking the perception based relative importance index of respondents about causes of variation orders. Existence of variation orders inside Tribhuvan University premises, Kathmandu has been noted from the study. 9.85%, 5.99%, 10.37%, 12.32% and 21.02% cost above the contract amount has been incurred at the completion of the projects respectively. Similarly, 26.67%, 83.33%, 12.5%, 20% and 25% time for the successive contract has been increased by the extension of the contract completion time. From the study, main causes of variation orders are known to be change of plan, change of scope, defect of bill of quantities, lack of specified and appropriate competent construction manager and impediment in prompt decision making. Similarly, causes of variation orders impacting project cost are additional work, client financial problems/ delay in payment of bill and change in design. Causes of variation orders impacting project time are change in design, delay in payment and dispute between parties to the contract. The control measures for the variation orders are appointment of project manager to supervise design, preparation of bill of quantities with good estimate and adequate financial planning. The findings of this study will be beneficial for developers, designers and contractors in building projects and also to the Governmental authorities to develop preventing measures to eliminate or reduce variation orders.",,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

However, mainstreaming climate change issues into sectoral policies from the government can be seen as recent activities in Nepal. Nepal has contributed negligible amount of emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) of global greenhouse gas, it is the fourth most vulnerable country in the world. In this context, this paper aims to review climate change adaptation policies in terms of sectoral integration. This paper has adopted text-mining method for information retrieval and knowledge mining and followed step-by-step approach to undertake review of policies. It concludes that National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010 can be a milestone in sectoral adaptation of climate change issue largely because it has provided the national framework for sectoral adaptation to climate change. However, NAPA ignores the importance of structural and institutional reforms needed for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into sectoral agencies. Climate change Policy, 2011, Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) 2011, Constitution of Nepal, 2015, Local Government Operation Act (LGOA) 2017, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017 and National REDD+ Strategy, 2018 are other prominent legislative and policy frameworks that have significant contribution in sectoral integration of climate change adaptation issues. However, lack of climate change act in order to implement fully these policies into practice for its implementation can be a major obstacle to achieve the goal.

This paper concludes that newly endorsed Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act (2017) can be a milestone in disaster management of Nepal not only because it has replaced about 40 years old Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 but also for the first time, it saw disaster risk management as an process focusing on different stages of disaster management cycles, preparedness, response and rehabilitation and mitigation. The provision of well-structured functional institutional set-up from the centre to local level can have positive outcome in disaster management. However, it overlooks significant aspect, such as the declaration of disaster-prone zones limiting the right of provincial disaster management committee only for recommendation to the Government of Nepal. Most of policies, strategies and legislations focused on some specific disasters such as flood, landslide, earthquake and GLOF/avalanches at national level paying less emphasis to the local level. Even now, most of the policy interventions towards different cycles of disaster risk management have laid emphasis on preparedness and response rather than to rehabilitation and mitigation. The conflicting provisions in Acts such as Water Resource Act (1992) and Building Act (1998) with Local Government Operation Act (2017) have made overlapping of their roles and responsibilities. So, the policy formulation and institutional set-up needs to be complemented by the ability and competence to operationalize the intent of the relevant acts and policies at all levels of government.The Geographical Journal of NepalVol. 11: 1-24, 2018 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/19546/16004,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Thus, the main objective was to explore the epidemiology of unintentional childhood injuries in urban and rural areas of Kavrepalanchok district. A cross sectional analytical study was done in Bethanchok rural municipality and Dhulikhel municipality of Kavrepalanchok district. The respondents were interviewed using a pretested semi-structured questionnaire. The details of injuries sustained within the past 12 months were included. A total of 667 children aged 1–16 years were surveyed, among which 26% from rural and 17.2% from urban areas had unintentional injuries in the past 12 months. Falls were the most common mode of injury in both the areas. Similarly, the proportion of burn was more in rural area (16.1%) whereas, Road Traffic Injuries were more in urban area (12.5%). Majority of the injuries occurred at home (54.5%) while the child was playing (64.1%). Factors like child’s gender and place of residence affected the occurrence of unintentional injuries (p<0.05). Out of total injured children, 18 of them had not recovered and 11 were left with some form of permanent disability. As the rate and pattern of unintentional childhood injuries in the rural and urban area differ, the prevention strategies should focus on risk factors that apply to both the areas and awareness should be created among the parents and primary caregivers about the fact that childhood injuries are predictable and preventable.",https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287487,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

A hybrid footprint measurement tool was built considering the principal factors affecting ecological footprint (EF). The correlation between settlement type (squatter and non-squatter) and the EF (as measured by the mean CEBI) was tested using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Knowledge, attitude and behavior of people regarding the environment sustainability were studied through questionnaires and field observation. The average CEBI of non-squatter settlements was found to be significantly more than that of squatter settlements. Squatter households in the sample had a statistically significantly lower environmental impact (in terms of energy and water consumption) than non-squatter households (p<0.01). The highest contribution to the total CEBI was from the food sector, followed by waste production. People’s attitudes towards the environmental sustanability varied and most of the squatter households had no clear opinion. Knowledge of environment-friendly practices were found comparatively more in non-squatter households. A majority of the respondents were ignorant about renewable energy. Identification of factors mainly responsible for increasing footprint is needed to design interventions for promoting sustainable development. The findings from this research will be useful for urban planners and other concerned professionals to make amends in sector policies for the sustainable development.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/62359/47444,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Electronic health technologies are a promising strategy to mitigate the rising burden of non-communicable diseases by strengthening primary healthcare center service delivery. However, electronic health implementation in Nepal is limited. Furthermore, electronic health use at the primary healthcare center level is chronically understudied. This qualitative study seeks to understand the perceived awareness, benefits, and determinants of electronic health uptake in Nepal, focusing on primary healthcare center-level non-communicable disease management. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 27 participants including policymakers, health experts, facility administrators, providers, and non-communicable diseases patients in 2019. We selected six urban primary healthcare center facilities via cluster convenience sampling for recruiting facility administrators, providers, and patients, and used convenience sampling to recruit policymakers and experts. We conducted thematic data analysis inductively and deductively using the electronic health readiness assessment framework to understand perceived barriers and facilitators of electronic health implementation. Results: While there was general awareness and acceptance of electronic health, multiple barriers impede readiness for implementation. These include policy making gaps, language barriers, low user technical literacy, concerns of overreliance on technology, and inadequate training for administrators and providers. Stakeholder suggestions include creating electronic health interfaces that meet the needs of end users (providers and patients), providing training to enable end users to effectively use electronic health technologies, and strong policy support at the national level. Conclusion: We identify several determinants for effectively promoting the use of electronic health for non-communicable diseases service delivery at the primary healthcare center level in Nepal.",http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20552076221114182,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Most of the urbanization is dominated in large and medium cities i.e., metropolitan, sub-metropolitan, and municipalities. Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies in the sector of urban land governance are growing day by day due to their capability of mapping, analyzing, detecting changes, etc. The main aim of this paper is to analyze the urban growth pattern in Banepa Municipality during three decades (1992-2020) using freely available Landsat imageries and explore driving factors for change in the urban landscape using the AHP model. The Banepa municipality is taken as a study area as it is one of the growing urban municipalities in the context of Nepal. The supervised image classification was applied to classify the acquired satellite image data. The generated results from this study illustrate that urbanization is gradually increasing from 1992 to 2012 while, majority of the urban expansion happened during 2012-2020, and it is still growing rapidly along the major roads in a concentric pattern. This study also demonstrates the responsible driving factors for continuous urban growth during the study period. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was adopted to analyze the impact of drivers which reveals that, Internal migration (57%) is major drivers for change in urban dynamics whereas, commercialization (25%), population density (16%), and real estate business (5%) are other respective drivers for alteration of urban land inside the municipality. To prevent rapid urbanization in this municipality, the concerned authorities must take initiative for proper land use planning and its implementation on time.

This study adopts a qualitative research design with narrative inquiry approach. For this, the experience of four research participants from Kathmandu valley were purposefully selected. In addition to listening and reflecting to their life stories about engagement to abandon agriculture occupation, their activities, emotions, and lifestyle were also narrated, observed and analyzed. The findings of this research indicate that several socio cultural aspects such as modernization, urbanization, industrialization had greater influence in this process. People in the name of being modern, were gradually shifting from traditional sector (agriculture) to modern economic sectors. The research hence concludes that potentiality of agricultural sector is still high for the country to generate employment and thus it is important to redefine the agricultural policy to attract youth towards it.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/tvet/article/download/45185/33905,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

The basic tools of data analysis are vector error correction model, long-run structural modeling, Granger causality test, generalized impulse response functions, persistence profile, and variance decomposition analysis. The paper shows that the remittance inflow and economic growth have bidirectional relationship in the long run, but there is no relationship in the short run. Remittance affects the dynamics of other variables like investment, financial development, and investment on human capital which indirectly affect the performance of the economy through these variables. Findings indicate that remittance could promote financial development in the short run. It also shows the possibility of negative shocks in remittance flow could have a permanent negative effect on educational attainment. It concludes that an environment for investment should be created for enhancing the role of remittance on economic growth. Policies promoting flow of remittance through formal channels and financial literacy should be effective tools for channelizing remittance for economic growth. The government should prioritize the educational sector to prevent dropout of the students from schools when the households are hit negatively due to remittance shocks.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/58540/43805,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

NAST, since its inception in 1982, has been continuously working in this area, introducing different technologies through many projects. It extended R&D and financial support to different individuals and industries working on biobriquetting. It was able to establish a biomass laboratory and Briquette Training Centre with workshop facilities to extend R&D and pedagogic support to university, college students and private sector. Many trainings were conducted under the Biovillage program and different projects.

A total of 943 adolescents (grades 9-11) in 8 schools from 3 provinces in Nepal participated in the study, and were selected by multi-stage, cluster, random sampling. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire (response rate; 91.9%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis (<0.05 significance) revealed that family SC (OR = 0.83) and PSS from family (OR = 0.95) were negatively associated with substance-use. Self-esteem (OR = 0.90), family and school SC (OR = 0.80 and 0.91, respectively), and PSS from family and friends (OR = 0.95 and 0.96, respectively) were protective against suicidal risk. None of the independent variables showed a preventive association with sexual behavior, but self-esteem was positively associated (OR = 1.11). Therefore, to improve the likelihood of adolescents becoming healthy adults, family and school level interventions to enhance self-esteem, PSS, and SC are helpful in protecting them against substance use and suicidal behavior. On the other hand, adolescents with high self-esteem are at greater risk for inappropriate sexual behavior and should therefore be monitored.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352827319304562,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Building upon ethnographic fieldwork among the urban poor in Kathmandu in the period 2010–2014, this chapter takes a closer look at how some of those who were earlier excluded from formal schooling navigate within a rapidly changing educational landscape. Analysing how poor families make choices when selecting schools for their children, and what factors that inform their education strategies, this chapter demonstrates that although the families were short on financial recourses, they managed to navigate through both private and public schooling, and many were also successful in finalizing university education. In doing so, this chapter adds to debates on how commodification of education, class production, and recent social and political changes contribute to shape the educational practices of urban poor people in Nepal and South Asia.",https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/58089772/oso-9780192884756-chapter-4.pdf,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

The adoption of rain water harvesting was mostly driven by trainings that farmers received while controlling for age, poverty status and off-farm income. The adoption of RWH technology more than doubles household agricultural and livestock income. Instrumental variable approach was used to check the robustness of the findings. Adopters benefited from an increased supply of irrigation water, which allows them to diversify their crops from cereal production to high-value crops during dry season.

This paper attempts to assess the key economic features of women and their degree of association on empowerment by place of residence. For this, the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, 2016 data were used. In total, 9,875 currently married women aged 15-49 years were used to analyze by applying descriptive and bivariate analysis techniques. The findings showed rural women have poor economic status compared with urban women. Agriculture is the main profession of women among both rural and urban areas but the non-agricultural profession is lower especially among rural (11.7%) women to compare with urban (24.6%) women. Similarly, unpaid work seems still prevalent in both urban (46.6%) and rural (59.6%) areas. The male domination is clearly observed in earning a position with their husband, being paid in the same job, and ownership of property related to land and house. The study showed that there is a positive and significant relationship between working women and their empowerment in both rural and urban areas. The better economic status of women has higher empowerment in comparison to the women who have poor status. Hence, economic power has an automatically positive influence on women's empowerment. However, it needs to be paid high attention to improve the prevailing poor women’s economic status in different circumstances. ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/hssj/article/download/49811/37155,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

The benefits of green spaces extend beyond their availability. This study aimed to assess the availability, quality, distribution, and environmental status of green spaces in Bhaktapur district using remote sensing, geographic information system, and field observation. The green spaces included in the study were forests, shrublands, grasslands, and water bodies. The study used satellite image classification to identify available green spaces in the district. Normalised difference vegetation index was used for analysing the vegetation quality of the green spaces. Weighted urban green space index map was prepared based on weighted land use land cover, vegetation index, and distance to green spaces to analyse the distribution of green spaces. Analysis of the environmental status of green spaces was carried out by scoring each green space using the weighted urban green spaces index and additional environmental parameters. The study identified 48 grasslands, 102 shrublands, 45 water bodies, and 634 forests/trees. The vegetation quality of forests was high throughout the district, grasslands had moderate quality while shrubland had low green quality. Among the water bodies, rivers were polluted by litter and sewage disposal. The weighted urban green space index showed that 24% (30.01 km 2 ) had very high green space availability while 23% (28.00 km 2 ) area had poor green space availability. The discrepancy in the distribution of green spaces was observed in municipalities of the district.

We carried out population surveys of Indian flying foxes in the Sallaghari Forest in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal by direct roost count method from July to November 2023. Further, we quantified the intensities of anthropogenic noise at every five-meter interval along the transects from the forest edge towards the main forest and recorded the minimum roosting heights at each point. Indian flying foxes were found to be roosting on trees belonging to six species. Eucalyptus sp. was the most abundant roost tree (50%) in the forest whereas the highest relative abundance of roosting Indian flying foxes was on Populus ciliata (40.1%). The regression analysis revealed that tree DBH and height and the combined interaction of height and canopy cover significantly increase the abundance of Indian flying foxes. The noise intensity at ground level and roosting height of Indian flying foxes showed a significant strong positive relationship indicating their roosting at higher tier under intense noise. We recommend measures for reducing anthropogenic noises and conserving large and tall trees to ensure the roosting habitat of Indian flying foxes in urban setups.",https://www.ecocycles.net/ojs/index.php/ecocycles/article/view/439/297,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Among them, the flood is one of the natural disasters and that occurred in the Narayani River basin. The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising. In order to effectively manage and prepare for potential flood hazards in the study area, an analysis of the flood risk assessment was conducted by taking into consideration three primary factors: the flood hazard map, flood exposure, and flood vulnerability. The layers of the population, crops, schools, hospitals, and road network were all exposed to flooding, and the factors that determined flood vulnerabilities were literacy, urban area, and agecomposition (less than 14 and more than 65). The higher flood risk area was found in Ward number 1, 3, 4,16,18,26 of Bharatpur metropolitan, Gaindakot municipality ward number 1 and 12, 15 of Madhyabindu Municipality.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-74923-1_822,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

The survey was conducted from February 3 to April 6, 2021, where a total of 116 respondents were selected randomly from Morang and Sunsari districts. The rooftop adopters had 30.5% and 33.2% of the roofs under farming in Morang and Sunsari, respectively, having the size of the roof of rooftop adopters significantly larger than nonadopters. A binary logit model was used to determine the factor affecting the adoption of RTG where age, gender, schooling year, training, and farming experience have a significant effect on the adoption of RTG. Locally available material was given preference under farming and nutritionally important 50 species were reported with tests of the daily food requirement of the respondents. The diversity indices suggest that ornamental plant diversity is more followed by vegetables. Though, adopters are continuing the garden but have reported that lack of proper policy and ineffective management makes it difficult to protect the life of roof. Concludingly, respondents and other willing people must be provided with training, financial support, and proper extension services as lack of training and extension services are the major problems reported in the study area.

An elasticity indicator shows 1% of land conversion in Siwalik resulted in 0.47 % and 0.21 % changes in ESVs during the two periods, respectively. Overall findings of this study, suggest that ESV has increased in the Siwalik region of Madhesh province in the last two decades, primarily due to an increase in forest cover. This increase should be taken as an opportunity to leverage policy support and programmatic implementation to increase forest cover and reduce land conversion",,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Standard fire safety status check was done with comparing with NBC 107:1994. A standard check list was prepared and compared with current status of buildings. Data was collected from site visits with check list and key informant interview. During survey of the existing commercial building it was found that not all the guideline mentioned in NBC 107: 1994 was followed. Many aspects of door detailing and stairs detailing were considered in Hanuman Central whereas in case of one stop mall staircase was narrow. Design aspect of Hanuman Central was found more advanced. There were four Exit route however only two of them lead to open space. One escape route lead to basement parking and another was behind the building from where street was nearly 300 m far. Semi enclosed stairs were present in all four buildings. No proper signage of exit was found. One stop mall seems to be more prepared and concerned about the fire safety. Smoke detector, dry powder extinguishers was found in working condition.

Physical activity level among general population in Nepal is reported to vary considerably. However, knowledge on physical activity in Nepali diabetics is very limited. Engagement in physical activity could be influenced by perception of barriers against adopting the behavior and benefits of adopting it. This study explores the prevalence of physical activity and factors that promote and hinder the behavior among urban residing diabetic patients from Nepal. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional design was adopted using a simple random sampling of type 2 diabetic patients from two diabetes clinics at Lalitpur and Kaski districts of Nepal. Two hundred and seventy participants were surveyed to obtain information on physical activity using Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Metabolic equivalent values were calculated and categorized into high, moderate and low levels of physical activity. The information on perceived facilitators and barriers was collected by Exercise Barriers and Benefits Survey scale. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the measures were estimated using multinomial logistic regression. Results The study showed relatively high prevalence of physical activity among the urban Nepali diabetic patients; 52% were moderately active and 28% highly active. Travel and work-related activities were the major contributors. Male participants, educated and those living in extended families were more motivated for physical activity than their counterparts. Physical fitness, strength and flexibility, better sleep at night, social interaction and longevity, were identified as the major facilitators. Family responsibilities, busy schedule and family discouragement were identified as barriers against being physically active. Conclusion The diabetic patients were mostly moderately physically active. Future research could explore different context-specific ways of remaining physically active, apart from walking and doing household chores. More focus should also be placed on leisure time physical activity as it was found to be low. Interventions could be designed by promoting the facilitators and addressing the barriers of physical activity, which is likely to reduce the healthcare costs of management of diabetic complications.",http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0199329,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

To accomplish this task, Marxist, Post-Marxist theories are taken into consideration in order to indicate how an institution or the process of institutionalization as such is debated and perceived in social science academia. Likewise, the research also uses the popular research methodology of pragmatism which focuses on data collection, analysis and field study. The research is conducted in Sunil Smirti Gaupalika (Rural Municipality) of Rolpa district and focuses on the role of institutions in order to transform particularly the economic life of the people. The research divides institutions into two parts. The first one includes the governmental local institution Gaupalika. The second part includes INGO/NGOs. This division enables to decipher and historicize what these government and non government institutions have done independently and collectively to uplift the life of target group. The research finds that INGO/NGOs and locals institution in the remote village like Sunil Smirti Gaupalika have played significant roles on uniting the economically poor and make individual and collective efforts to fight against poverty. They work to find out the poor and economically weak section of the society by setting target group, generating the awareness and providing conductive environment for putting collective effort in their fight against poverty to a certain extent. Therefore, these two types of institutions have been found tremendously supportive in uniting what Marx calls “have-nots” of Sunil Smirti Gaupalika. However, the research also finds that mostly Brahmin/Chhetri communities have been benefitted by these programs.

In this context nurturing resilience in the face of various uncertainties of environmental, socioeconomic and other sociopolitical risk is an urgent matter. Resilience has become an important goal for many cities throughout the world leading to the enhancement of urban ecology and maintenance of essential ecosystem goods and services to make sure the sustainable future for all. The Kathmandu metropolitan city is one of the fastest-growing capital cities with recent and frequent evidence of unplanned development, loss of green space, tragic events of an earthquake, flood and other environmental problems causing devastation, economic damages, and loss of human life/health, and habitats. In this background, the paper evaluates suitable sites for urban green space development using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) based multi-criteria analysis methods with geographical information system (GIS).Variables taken for this study are school point data, health facility’s location data, emergency service’s locations, water bodies, emergency road network data, recent land use/land cover data, population data, existing park, and slope. The unit of a study is a metropolitan city. Our evaluations demonstrate the spatial distribution of different not suitable areas, less suitable, moderate suitable, and highly suitable area respectively, of the 4.47%, 7.19% of the area are high and moderate suitable area, while the largest area 78.87% is less suitable and 9.47% are not suitable for the development of green open space. The result indicates human occupancy is everywhere and per capita, open green space in the city is very below the global average. The local government must think about different modality for development of green open space in collaboration with other government agency occupying more open space or engagement with private sectors.

Technological tools like GIS and Remote Sensing, and Spatial metrics/indices has been used for spatial analysis. The study shows that within ten years time span of 2003 to 2012, urban land use has gone drastic change in Kathmandu valley. Remarkable change in terms of pace and direction is evident in agriculture and built-up classes which signifies the rapid urbanization trend in the valley. The finding shows that spatial structure of the urban landuse of the valley is impending towards more heterogeneous and diverse landscape. Similarly, spatial fragmentation analysis highlights characteristic development of new isolated urban patches inside relatively larger agriculture patches fragmenting them into number of smaller patches.

Utilizing a descriptive research methodology, data was gathered through close-ended and open-ended questionnaires, case studies, and field observations across various impacted communities. Secondary data sources included existing literature on landless housing reconstruction and community-based initiatives. The findings reveal that the landless communities suffered greatly due to seismically vulnerable structures, lack of preparedness, and insufficient use of critical seismic features. These communities often lack access to vital information that could mitigate disaster risks. The study further explores how residents have innovatively rebuilt their homes by integrating safety measures, utilizing salvaged materials, and combining traditional knowledge with scientifically validated techniques.

Data was collected from 305 children over six months from September 2019 to January 2020. Anthropometric measurements (weight and length) were collected of all children and their mothers’/care takers were interviewed on the Infant and Young Child Feeding practices. Data was analyzed using WHO Anthro Survey Analyzer, Microsoft Excel and STATA 15Results: Early initiation of breastfeeding was 47.9% and use of bottle was 48.5%. Minimum dietary diversity, minimum meal frequency and minimum acceptable diet were 66.2%,79.1% and 54.4% respectively. Consumption of nutrient-poor packaged foods was 63.0%with biscuits being the most common type (52.1%) and 32.8% of the children were found to be drinking tea.

But the urban areas still have rural characteristics and insufficient infrastructures. Due to the increasing urbanization, the maintenance of sufficient open spaces, greeneries and the preservation of agricultural lands has become important urban issues in Nepal. The loss of productive lands has resulted in decrease of food self-sufficiency and green spaces in the cities.

Spatio-temporal urban growth processes and its types were identified, which allows the construction of spatial logistic regression (SLR) models and subsequently urban growth projections. Results indicate that population density, proportion of built-up land area in the surrounding area and land value are the strongest predictors of overall urban growth. For infill growth, the most significant predictors are distance to urban centre, proportion of built-up land area in the surrounding area, distance to major roads and population density, whereas land value and proportion of built-up land area in the surrounding area are the major predictors for expansion.

It is due to declining soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Several studies have been done to restore and improve the soil quality, however conservation agriculture (CA)-based practices of minimum tillage, crop residue retention and appropriate crop rotations has been observed to be promising across the globe. Studies on CA under Nepal’s rainfed farming systems of Terai and hills of Nepal improved the soil quality, increased individual crop and system yields, reduced labor demand and was economically profitable. However, lack of adequate soil moisture during planting in initial seasons, inadequate tillage equipment and weed management options are the key constraints of rainfed farming to be transformed into CA in initial stages. In Nepal, the introduction of animal-drawn direct seeding equipment, management of residues or mulches, mechanical or herbicidal weed management options for small-scale rainfed hill farmers can be of paramount significance in scaling-out of the CA based practices in Nepal. For this, further on-station and on-farm verifications of CA based practices need to be carried out across the various cropping systems and agro[1]ecological regions of the country by Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC), Nepal in collaboration with international CG centers, universities, extension and development institutions.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44723/33659,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

During the asymptomatic phase of prediabetes, an estimated 20-30% of persons may develop complications like retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, neuropathy and nephropathy. Screening and lifestyle management may help to delay or arrest progression to diabetes. In primary care settings, point of care devices that measure glucose in capillary blood can be used for diagnosis of diabetes. This study was carried out to evaluate the performance of fasting capillary glucose (FCG) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurement in screening for diabetes and prediabetes among adults in a semi-urban community in the Kathmandu district of Nepal. An observational, cross-sectional study design was used and FCG, FPG performance was evaluated by the 2-hour plasma glucose levels (2-hr PG) following Oral glucose tolerance test (75g glucose) using WHO 1998 criteria. Linear regression was performed to assess correlation co-efficient (r) between FPG, FCG and 2 hr PG. Bland Altman plot and Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to assess concordance, measure ROC AUC and determine sensitivity and specificity of the measurements at recommended cut-off values for identifying diabetes and prediabetes. Among the study participants (n=162), 104 were female and 58 were male. Prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes was 4.32% (95% CI 1.75% to 8.70%) and 7.14% (95% CI 3.89% to 12.58%). Strong positive correlation was seen between FPG and FCG (Spearman’s r 0.67). FPG & FCG had a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.49 & 0.45) with 2 hr PG levels (p<0.0001). FCG and FPG ROC AUC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.97) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.97) in comparison to 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.0) for the gold standard 2 hr PG. At 110 mg/dl and above, FCG had an optimal sensitivity and specificity of 84.21% and 81.12% in comparison to 47.37% and 100% for FPG. At 100 mg/dl, the sensitivity and specificity of FCG was 100% and 51.75% in comparison to 57.89% and 97.20% for FPG. In conclusion, at each recommended cut-off value, FCG was more sensitive than FPG with no significant difference between ROC AUCs of the two tests. Hence, FCG may be a suitable, sensitive, and convenient screening tool for diabetes and prediabetes in community-based settings. Larger prospective studies may validate the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of similar screening strategies in the Nepalese community.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/nmcj/article/download/27615/22825,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

This study aimed to identify the gender differences in prevalence and risk factors of comorbid diabetes and hypertension (CM) among adults aged 18 years and above in an urban community in Kathmandu, Nepal. A community-based cross-sectional analytical study was carried out in Gokarneshwor Ward 1, 2 and 3 among adults aged 18 years and above from September 2020- May 2023. Diabetes (DM) was defined as persons previously diagnosed by a physician and/or on anti-diabetic medication. Hypertension (HTN) was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥90 mm Hg or those who were diagnosed by a physician and/or receiving antihypertensive medication. Comorbidity (CM) was defined as persons with diabetes and hypertension. Information regarding socio-demographic data, behavioural and biological risk factors, anthropometric assessment and morbidity were obtained from adults aged 18 years and above using a Family study proforma. Multinomial logistic regression analyses with the referent category being persons with no diabetes or hypertension (NDH) were performed for three categories HTN vs NDH, DM vs NDH and CM vs NDH. Among 1538 adults with 776 women, overall prevalence of comorbidity was 5.3% (95% CI: 4.3 – 6.5); among men 6.1% and 5.5% among women. After adjusting for age, for both women and men, being currently married, alcohol use, family history of diabetes and generalized obesity were associated with comorbidity. However, these associations were more robust for men. Moreover, measures of central obesity were associated with comorbidity for men alone. Though alcohol use was higher among men, the association with comorbidity was more robust for women. Paradoxically, lower educational status among women and higher education among men were associated with higher odds of comorbidity. In conclusion, prevalence of comorbid diabetes and hypertension may differ marginally among men and women. Though comorbidity rates appear to be lower in Nepal in comparison to other countries in South Asia, the rising burden emphasizes the need for tailored public health interventions that address modifiable risk factors among men and women.

Methods: In total, 300 women consented to participate in the study, of which 267 women were able to participate in a follow-up 1 month after discharge. We developed a household water insecurity scale (HWIS; total score range 0–24 points) by adapting the household food insecurity access scale. Results: The Cronbach's coefficient alpha for the HWIS was moderately acceptable. Psychological health was assessed in terms of postnatal depression and physical health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The median score of the HWIS was 8, and more than 60% of the participants answered that they sometimes or often worried about not having enough water, used only small amounts of water, had a lack of hygiene, and had insufficient time for childrearing. Multiple regression models showed that women with high levels of stress derived from household water insecurity had greater odds of probable depression and lower physical HRQOL scores than did women with low HWIS scores. Conclusion: The results suggest that improving water security is necessary to foster maternal psychological health in developing countries.",http://iwaponline.com/jwh/article-pdf/14/2/317/394759/jwh0140317.pdf,,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
