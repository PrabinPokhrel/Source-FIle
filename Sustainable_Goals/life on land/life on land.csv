Here, we report on evidence that interfacing two metal thin films can suppress spin transmission and absorption. We examine spin pumping in spin-source/spacer/spin-sink heterostructures, where the spacer consists of metallic Cu and Cr thin films. The Cu/Cr spacer largely suppresses spin pumping—i.e., neither transmitting nor absorbing a significant amount of spin current—even though Cu or Cr alone transmits a sizable spin current. The antiferromagnetism of Cr is not essential for the suppression of spin pumping, as we observe similar suppression with Cu/V spacers with V as a nonmagnetic analog of Cr. We speculate that diverse combinations of spin-transparent metals may form interfaces that suppress spin pumping, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our work may stimulate a new perspective on spin transport in metallic multilayers.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

It uses the Pearson correlation matrix to study the relationship between stock prices ad macroeconomic variables. The results obtained from correlation analysis revealed that market performance of stock prices is found to respond positively to broad money supply and gross domestic product and negatively to the inflation rate as expected. Also, the NEPSE index is not affected by the changes in the per capita income of the nation.

This is perhaps an unsurprising conclusion, but still worth noting given the current policy debates about development aid around the world, which range from 'close the [World] Bank!' on the one hand to 'triple development aid!' on the other (Verweij and Gyawali 2006). Nepal is strewn with highly expensive development failures that have lined the pockets of Western consultants and companies, as well as less-than-honest domestic decision makers (see Chapters 3, 4 and 10). These include the infamous Arun 3 dam and similarly large hydro projects, often pushed by the World Bank and other aid donors (Chapter 8).

Ecologically sensitive areas as well as mountainous regions face some similar challenges when it comes to solid waste management (SWM). This study recommends that solutions need to be steadily built on a framework in order to successfully and sustainably manage mountain waste. This report presents various recommendations and implementable actions that may be adopted in a phased manner in order to overcome SWM challenges faced in mountain areas. The presented recommendations to manage solid waste in mountain areas are generally aligned with the integrated SWM framework and are summarized in the report. This study represents the first attempt of the World Bank to examine SWM issues in these unique, ecologically fragile areas that face concurrent challenges of high poverty and increasing pressures from tourism development. Chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two discusses the current landscape of the SWM sector in Nepal. In chapter three, the report investigates the current situation regarding SWM in the mountain areas of Nepal. Chapter four looks at the complexity of managing solid waste in mountain areas as well as the various challenges and opportunities that arise. Chapter five presents a framework or foundation on which solutions can be steadily built and presents recommendations and related implementable actions along a phased approach. In conclusion, chapter six briefly summarizes the role of the World Bank in the SWM sector and how it can provide support to clients to improve SWM services and practices in mountain areas in the South Asia region and elsewhere.

Among them, the flood is one of the natural disasters and that occurred in the Narayani River basin. The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising. In order to effectively manage and prepare for potential flood hazards in the study area, an analysis of the flood risk assessment was conducted by taking into consideration three primary factors: the flood hazard map, flood exposure, and flood vulnerability. The layers of the population, crops, schools, hospitals, and road network were all exposed to flooding, and the factors that determined flood vulnerabilities were literacy, urban area, and agecomposition (less than 14 and more than 65). The higher flood risk area was found in Ward number 1, 3, 4,16,18,26 of Bharatpur metropolitan, Gaindakot municipality ward number 1 and 12, 15 of Madhyabindu Municipality.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Data entry and analysis was done on IBM SPSS V20. Descriptive statistical measures were employed. Results: This study showed that cancer was seen in advanced age group with no sex wise variations. Majority was married, literate, from rural area, of upper caste and upper lower socioeconomic status. Cancer of lung, rectum and bile duct were more frequent in males in contrary to that of breast, ovary and cervix in females. Malignant neoplasm of digestive organs in males and that of female genital organs in females were the commonest to occur according to ICD-10 classification. Conclusions: Cancer is rapidly emerging non-communicable disease throughout the world. Despite lack of population based disease registry, patterns of disease from this hospital study emphasize prioritizing the health promotive activities against cancer in the general population.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/22601/19232,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The main aim of this study is to identify and evaluate the durability characteristics of some sandstones against slaking, freezing-thawing and abrasion. Lithosomes were characterized in the field. The following laboratory tests included measurements of dry density, specific gravity, water absorption, Slake Durability Index (SDI), Sulphate Soundness (SS), and Los Angles Abrasion (LAA). Sandstones from the Lower Siwalik Subgroup (LSS) are massive to cross-stratified, very fine- to medium-grained, and occasionally calcareous, whereas the sandstone from the Middle Siwalik Subgroup (MSS) are mostly cross-stratified to few massive, medium- to coarse-grained with salt-and-pepper appearance, and uncommonly calcareous. Sandstones have four different types of deterioration and had high to extremely high SDI. The majority of the sandstones have displayed similar slaking tendencies. Under the five-cycle SS test, the majority of sandstones from LSS and MSS have experienced low final weight loss (below 10%). However, two from LSS and three from MSS have experienced greater final weight loss. The LAA values range from 29.66% to 99.14%, and except two sandstones from LSS, rest of the samples have exceeded 45% abrasion showing they were incompetent in terms of abrasion test, and are highly susceptible to abrasion. The uniformity factor ranges from 0.21 to 0.44 indicating that all the sandstones were of non-uniform hardness. Correlation among physical parameter and durability indices was weak to moderate probably because of varied nature of sandstones.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/50823/37954,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Integration of vermicompost, biofertilizer (Azotobacter chrococcom) and chemical fertilizer can improve the situation. A field experiment was conducted to assess the combined application of vermicompost, chemical fertilizer and biofertilizer on the growth, yield, and  nitrogen uptake of wheat at Rampur Chitwan from November 2021 to April 2022. The experiment was laid out in a strip-split plot design with five N levels as horizontal factors (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% of recommended dose), two vermicompost levels (0 and 5 t ha-1) as the vertical factor, and two biofertilizer levels (with and without application) as the sub-plot factor with three replications. Data on growth, yield attributes and yield of wheat, nitrogen uptake were   collected, analyzed and presented. The research result revealed a significant influence of biofertilizer and nitrogen levels on grain yield of wheat. Full dose of nitrogen resulted a significantly higher grain yield (4441.71 kg ha-1) than other nitrogen levels (0, 25, 50, 75 % of recommended dose with grain yield 2792.11, 2982.20, 3771.17. 4231.63 kg ha-1 respectively). Biofertilizer application had significantly higher grain yield (3726.76 kg ha-1) compared with no biofertilizer application (3560 kg ha-1). There was significant interactions between biofertilizer application and nitrogen levels on number of grains per spike and sterility percent of wheat. The number of grain per spike was highest with 100% recommended N with biofertilizer application (47.52 grains/spike) followed by 75 % recommended N with biofertilizer application (46.53 grains/spike).

The experiences gathered from Irrigation Sector Projects implemented under various donor agencies such as the World Bank (WB), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and UN/ILO have shown that successful irrigation projects must be defined and planned according to specific ecological regions and pertinent to the local environment. An integrated development approach considers the land use, roads, market, and other economic activities as they relate to prospects for poverty alleviation. Land evaluation and subsequent land use planning according to the soil, climate, land profile, and suitability of agriculture practices should be considered in the development works to ensure true benefit to the rural populations. The integrated approach as such will provide long term sustainability through environmentally sound practices. This approach has been widely applied in the European countries, Korea, Japan, and Sri Lanka.This paper primarily focuses on the irrigation and development approaches most suitable to Nepal’s three ecological regions. High mountain regions should be developed with pasture land, horticulture, organic vegetable farming, and tourism. Irrigation technology in these areas should be simple pipe conveyance, and tank irrigation. In the mid-hills horticulture on the sloping terrain and cereal crops in the river valleys with other diversified cropping systems should be applied. The Terai region is the ‘Bread Basket’ of Nepal, and has high potential for diversified agriculture and industrial development.For development in these regions to succeed, road networks and transportation facilities are essential to economic growth. Road transportation maximizes opportunity for tourism and other economic activities. Development work must be planned in an integrated approach, which should be based on appropriate land use patterns for environmentally sustainable practices. An ideal solution would be to envision the watershed as the unit for eco-friendly sustainable development planning involving all the stakeholders under the watershed purview. As an example, the principles of Integrated Water Resources Management Planning (IWRMP), and Integrated Watershed Management Plan (IWMP) have been successfully applied in the USA and Australia (Box 1). It has illustrated that vegetative covered catchment stores large amount of rain water, increases groundwater table, reduces erosion of soil, and lastly decreases the intensity of flood hazard. Whereas, the naked catchment areas are highly erodible, does not store rain water, susceptible to high erosion and landslides, and increases the flood intensity by three fold than a vegetative covered one. The vegetative cover increases the water resources availability for over all development for agriculture.                               HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 20Page: 31-40",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/16486/13409,,SDG 15: Life on Land

GEE eases the way in extracting, analyzing, and performing different operations for the earth’s observed data. Land cover classification, Centre of gravity (CoG), and their trajectories for all LC classes: agriculture, built-up, water, forest, and barren area were extracted with five-year intervals, along with their Ecosystem service values (ESV) to understand the load on the ecosystem. We also discussed the aspects and problems of the spatiotemporal analysis of developing regions. It was observed that the built-up areas had been increasing over the years and more centered in between the two major cities. Other agriculture, water, and forest classes had been subjected to fluctuations with barren land in the decreasing trend. This alteration in the area of the LC classes also resulted in varying ESVs for individual land cover and total values for the years. The accuracy for the RF classifier was under substantial agreement for such fragmented LCs.

Nepali city leaders are also aspiring to make their cities smart. A smart city basically has clever improvements made in three sectors of its operations: technological, human, and institutional. Globally, many cities have recently made impressive enhancements in at least one or more of these areas. Nepal’s National Planning Commission (NPC) in 2016 had released a concept paper on smart cities for Nepal, defining smart cities as sustainable, information and technology-based, with high quality services and replicable (NPC 2016). As most Nepali cities still operate with limited infrastructure, services, and amenities, making them smart is a challenging task. However, some elements of a smart city can be incrementally and selectively implemented by the Nepali urban governments. This paper assesses the successes and challenges in some of the smart cities globally, and as an example assesses the pollution reduction and efficiency impact of adopting a bus-rapid transit system in Nepal. It is seen that a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system for the Kathmandu Valley consisting of electrical buses, will drastically reduce air pollution, and improve mobility for the residents. Urban leaders in Nepal can begin to identify such a transit related and other smart elements to be gradually implemented in their cities which will improve efficiency of urban services, enhance quality of life for the urban residents, and promote sustainability of the overall urban system.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/45769/35807,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Identifiation of the cause in class II div 1 malocclusion with the help of lateral cephalograms is crucial in diagnosis and treatment planning. Materials and Methods: Digital copies of lateral cephalograms of Class II div 1 patients visiting the Orthodontic department at Nobel Medical College were obtained. Web-based digital tracing, Webceph Plus version 1.5.0, was used for Steiner’s and McNamara’s analyses. The cephalometric values were compared with the established values of the Caucasians and the Nepalese norms wherever applicable. The comparison was done using an independent t-test with a level of signifiance set at 5%. Result: As compared to Caucasians and Nepalese normal, Class II div 1 patients in our study had significantly increased ANB angle (6.4±2.1°, p<0.001) and proclined upper (UI-NA=28.7±7.3°, p< 0.001) and lower incisors (LI-NB=29.6±6.9° p<0.001).

However, there is a widespread view that young men and women are becoming more at ease in each other's company and beginning sexual experiences prior to marriage, putting them at risk of the consequences of unsafe sex. This research aims to evaluate the factors associated with premarital sexual behavior and its consequences among Nepalese college-going adolescents and youths. This cross-sectional web-based study included 415 Nepalese students over the age of 18 who were enrolled in a bachelor's degree program in a discipline other than health science. Data was collected from students online using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Pearson's chi-square (χ2) and logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between the independent and outcome variables. Most participants (61.7%) had dating experience and 21.2% had premarital sex. About three-fourths (76.1%) of participants had premarital sex before the age of 20 years and the ages of sexual debut ranged from 13 to 25 years. The major reasons for sexual debut were desire, curiosity, continuation of love relationship, and peer pressure. One-third of students (33.0%) reported having more than two sex partners, and 11.4% had intercourse with commercial sex workers. Among students who had premarital sex, 13.7% of participants or their sex partners, had to undergo abortions because of unintended pregnancies. Having an illiterate parent (AOR=11.0; 95% CI=2.01-60.87), high pocket money (AOR=4.2; 95% CI=1.1-16.2), increased dating culture (AOR=18.8; 95% CI=4.8-74.2), a close friend who has experienced premarital sex (AOR=5.2; 95% CI=2.21-12.21), and exposure to pornography (AOR=97.87; 95% CI= 9.5-10001.4) were predictors of premarital sex among Nepalese college students.

Methods: A prospective study was conducted at Chitwan Medical College for a duration of 2 years from January 2017 to December 2018 among the patients undergoing hemodialysis via CVC. The data collected were related to patients’ demographics, site of catheter insertion, and duration, microbiological data including cultures from catheter sites, blood, and catheters’ tips and antibiotic sensitivity. Catheter related infection was divided into catheter related local infection (CRLI) and catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI). Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 21.0. Results: A total of 41 cases of CVC related infection (CRI) were documented with an incidence rate of 6.94 episodes per 1000 catheter days at risk. Out of the total CRI, 39.02% were CRLI and 60.98% were CRBSI. Fever with chills and rigor were the most common clinical presentation. Risk factors for the development of CRI were duration of catheter in situ, repeated change of CVC and the use of CVC for indications other than hemodialysis (HD). Staphylococci and Klebsiella were the most common organisms isolated in culture. Conclusion: The rate of CRI among Nepalese patients undergoing hemodialysis is high. Prolonged duration of CVC usage, recent change of catheter and the use of the HD catheter for the purpose of institution of intravenous medication have been found as the risk factors for CRI.",https://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/1036/953,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Before using this tool in any population, its validation needs to be assessed. This study was carried out to check validation in cardiac surgical patients in Nepalese patients. Method: This is a prospective observational analytical cohort study in 500 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement surgeries (mitral valve, aortic valve or double valve replacements) and valve and aorta replacement surgeries (Bentall procedure). The data were entered in the Microsoft excel software and were analyzed using Chi Square test from Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Version - 17) package. Calibration power and discriminative power were calculated. Result: The model’s validation was assessed by its calibration and discriminative power. Calibration power was assessed using Hosmer- Lemeshow test (Chi-square test). It gave P value of 0.14 indicating that the model adequately fits the data and can predict mortality. Discriminative power was assessed by calculating area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve which was 0.71 indicating satisfactory discriminative power. In low and moderate risk groups, observed and predicted (additive and logistic) mortality were satisfactory. In high risk group, observed mortality was higher than predicted mortality. Logistic EuroSCORE value was nearer to observed value. Conclusion: EuroSCORE can be applied in Nepalese cardiac surgical patients in low and moderate risk groups satisfactorily though additive EuroSCORE is better in prediction. In high risk groups, logistic and additive EuroSCORE under predicted outcome than the observed mortality. However logistic EuroSCORE was better in this group of patients.

The study conducted 45 households questionnaire survey in total using simple random sampling in ward number six of Chhathar Jorpati rural municipality. The statistical analysis of collected field survey data was preformed through correlation test and standard deviation. The result shows that the socio-economic condition and the livelihood of the vegetable farmers is improving in recent years. Before doing commercial vegetable farming, farmers cultivated potatoes and used to exchange their production with cereal crops to the neighboring villages. Farmers used to cultivate maize in their farmland, but due to the climatic and the topographic condition it took almost nine months (from January to October) for production. Among the total households, 24.4 percent farmers have seven members in their family and the average family size is 6.3. The Chhetri is the dominant ethnic group of the study area.

The presence of evergreen subtropical and temperate deciduous broadleaf forest (Quercus, Betula, Juglans, Alnus), needle-leaved element (Pinus, Tsuga) and high altitude taxa (Picea, Abies) with Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae show mixed pollen assemblages indicating warm and humid paleoclimate. The coniferous pollen indicates the altitude was higher during the deposition time and the presence of Betula, Quercus, and Juglans suggests temperate forest. Domination of Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae shows a strong influence of the Himalayan topographic barrier during the sediment deposition.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/31260/24731,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Imminent water crisis due to climate change, water demanding nature of traditionally cultivated rice, increasing scarcity of labor and escalating labor costs drive the search for alternative management methods to increase water productivity, system sustainability and profitability in rice cultivation. Direct seeded rice (DSR) technique has received much attention and popularity nowadays because of its low-input demanding nature that can mitigate emission of green-house gases and adaption to climatic risks. DSR involves sowing of dry seed into a prepared seedbed, pre-germinated seed into a puddled soil surface and standing water. The development of early maturing varieties and use of efficient nutrient management practices along with increased adoption of integrated weed management techniques have encouraged many farmers to switch from transplanted to DSR culture. DSR technology is highly mechanized in some developed countries like USA, Australia, Japan, China, Korea etc. This shift from traditional rice to DSR will substantially reduce crop water requirements, soil organic-matter turnover, enhanced nutrient management, carbon sequestration, weed management, greenhouse-gas emissions and enhance crop intensification. However, weed and nematode infestation, blast, panicle sterility, lack of suitable varieties for DSR and lodging are major challenges. Based on existing evidences, this paper reviews the integrated package of technologies for DSR, potential advantages and challenges associated with it.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44786/33689,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Low maize productivity in the western hills of Nepal has traditionally been associated with the absence of high yielding varieties. The purpose of this study was to find single cross maize hybrids that would be highly productive and adaptable for summer planting in western hills of Nepal. An alpha lattice design with three replications was used to evaluate one hundred single cross hybrids, including checks at NMRP, Rampur; DoAR, Surkhet; and DoAR, Doti during the summer season of 2019. In the evaluated maize hybrids, all measured traits showed significant genetic variation, indicating the presence of substantial genetic diversity among tested hybrids and significant genotype by environmental interaction highlighting the variable performance across locations. RML-145/RL-105, RML-97-1/RML-98, RML-145/RML-146, RML-138/RML-2, and RML-97-2/RL-105 was among the top 17 hybrids with grain yields of 8-9 t ha1. Significant correlations of grain yield with plant height, ear height, test weight, cob length, and cob diameter suggest that these are the important traits while selecting the hybrids for yield. The study also employed 20 SSR markers to explore genetic diversity of 25 inbred lines which were used for developing top yielding hybrids, grouped these inbred lines into five distinct cluster showed moderate genetic diversity, and higher yield performance of hybrids associated with diverse background of parental lines.

Numbers of vegetable crops grown were increased with respect to yield and net return from both the winter and summer vegetables. With the opening of organized markets and large scale increase in income, farmers were attracted towards vegetable cultivation that provided wide range of vegetables for consumers as well. Earlier farmers cultivated vegetables only when there would be fallow land after the harvest of main season cereal crops while after the adoption of new technology farmers grew vegetables all the yearround. Among the popular vegetables during summer was cucumber in the hills and okra in the Terai covering more land than other vegetables crops in the study area.

These measures can only be effective when the people co-operate. The awareness and health-related behavior have a major role in determining society’s response. Meanwhile adolescents are at the risk of deviating from disciplined health-related behaviors due to turbulence arising from their hormones despite of their awareness. This study aims to study COVID-19 awareness and its impact on health-related behavior of adolescents. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional web-based online study of 299 adolescents enrolled in various educational programs, between ages 13 to 19 years was conducted between June 18, 2020 and July 11, 2020 in Nepal. The questionnaire consisted of demographic characteristics, 16 items on knowledge and 40 items on behavior. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests and binary logistic regression were conducted in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Results: A total of 299 adolescents were enrolled in the study. Majority (92.6%) of the adolescents had adequate awareness. Positive health-related behavior was seen in 72% of the adolescents. Spiritual behavior was the most affected in comparison to physical, social and psychological behavior. Adolescents with adequate awareness on COVID-19 were 10.67 times more likely to perform positive health related behavior (P=0.005; 95% CI=2.01-56.47). Conclusion: Majority of the adolescents had adequate awareness. Significant percentage of adolescents had positive health-related behavior. Positive behaviour was not proportionately in level with adequate awareness. Effective health programs and policies are needed to transform adequate awareness into positive health-related behaviour for effective control of disease.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/35124/29410,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The mechanism of the LSL failure process is not well understood due to the different deformation stages controlled by geological structures and causative/ triggering factors. Regional tectonic structures and local rock mass characteristics play a vital role in the formation of LSLs. Engineering geological characterization was performed to evaluate the rock/soil properties, and the associated state of danger (cracks, seepage, etc.). The rock mass rating (RMR) and geological strength index (GSI) methods were used to estimate rock mass quality and strength parameters. The estimated strength parameters together with laboratory test data were used to set up a two-dimensional (2D) landslide surface to simulate the failure scenarios. The simulation of landslide models was iterated under different loading conditions by incorporating geological heterogeneities. The results have demonstrated that the movement of the slope was affected by different stress conditions over time, which were verified using spatiotemporal landslide data. The landslide exhibited a three-stage failure mechanism with the development of tension-induced cracking at the rear and shearing failure of the critical locking section in the middle section. The tension shear and joint-step-path rupture along joint surfaces occurred during different stages of the landslide failure processes. The simulated results showed that the genetic development of LSL is mainly attributed to the geological structures and sudden changes in stress conditions. Thus, the research outcomes can be illustrative to evaluate the role of geological discontinuities, geotechnical parameters and triggering effects by the numerical simulation techniques for the failure mechanism of LSLs.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57921/43297,,SDG 15: Life on Land

However, empirical studies have shown mixed results. This study attempts to assess the impact of Double Taxation Avoidance (DTA) Treaties on inflow of Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) in Nepal. This study uses a comprehensive panel database containing annual flow of FDI from 89 countries for the period of 1990-2016 as well as other factors that might affect FDI flow into the country. We used pooled OLS and fixed effect methods. The study finds that singing DTA agreement have had small but positive impact on the inflow of FDI. Specifically, Nepal receives, on average, between 91.90 to 216.54 million more FDI per country per year from countries with DTA agreement compared to countries without such agreement.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/48036/35996,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The explanations for the high-income country mortality trends are multiple and certainly include incidence reductions, but better treatments are also contributory. How to bring to Nepal the global lessons in achieving better cancer care is uncertain. We need to create an environment of ideas and a powerful vision to meet the needs for better major cancer management for Nepalis.Broadly, the Nepalese challenges are in creating more accessible and affordable care of sufficiently high-quality to make a difference. Hospitals are the major places where these issues have to be considered. To address these challenges, we offer a vision and suggest here strategies of major organizational changes in: Innovative staffing models, emphasizing teamwork, with increases in responsibilities, activities and work force percentages of non-physician health professionals; Increased outpatient care and tele-health; 3.Creating and following evidence-based diagnostic pathway and treatment clinical practice guidelines and checklists; 4. Increased application of information technology tools, particularly electronic medical records; and 5.

Compared to foreign direct investment (FDI) or foreign aid (grants & loans), the money injected to the economy of Nepal through remittances is markedly larger. Huge investment in the real estate sector and large sums of money applied for share subscription indicate the need and opportunities of channelizing remittances in the infrastructure development and productive sector. However, most studies on remittances are focused on the ex-post analysis of the economy and few studies focus on the planning and policy issues aimed to utilize remittances. This paper reviews literature on utilizing remittance money and analyzes the prospects of capitalizing remittances in Nepal. A conceptual model is proposed on utilizing remittance money for infrastructure development. The proposed model of a remittance investment trust aims to synergize the three best attributes of the three domains of stakeholders, namely, abundant remittance money of the people, excellent management skills of the private sector, and the superior public trust to the government. Remittance money can serve as a great investment vehicle for executing properly investigated and attractive infrastructure projects. As estimated for Lumbini province, the remittance investment trust may contribute to fulfill 20% of the deficit of investment towards achieving the sustainable development goals. While the model is proposed for a province, it is expected to be replicable to the national and sub-national governments in Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/55075/42217,,SDG 15: Life on Land

River flooding is caused by heavy monsoon rainfall, weak geology, unplanned infrastructure construction along the embankments, and mining in upstream riverbeds. The Andheri Khola (river) is a tributary of the Sunkoshi River that frequently floods, affecting the inhabitants along the way. In Nepal, little effort has been made to comprehend the flood risk in tiny catchment regions such as Andheri Khola, despite the fact that this sort of small catchment is affecting Nepal's numerous new rising towns and urban areas in many ways.

Spatial and temporal dynamics of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values are the most useful and reliable technique to analyze the general vegetation dynamics at the regional level. Thus, this study analyzed the spatial pattern and temporal trend of NDVI values of naturally vegetated areas in the Madi Watershed of Nepal relating to its geomorphic and built-up density factors in 2000, 2010,and 2020. Lands at images were used to derive NDVI values and SRTM DEM and the topographic map were used to derive geomorphic factors and built-up density. This study excluded cultivated land, built-up area, water body, cliff, snow-cover area, glacier, and glacier moraine areas to derive only naturally vegetated areas. Human population data was collected from the population censuses. Field observation and information collected from the field to verify ground reality in 15 different watersheds. This study revealed that there is a significant increase in natural vegetation in all parts of the watershed. However, there is the highest rate of increase in vegetation in lower plain areas, where the population density is the highest. The overall increase in natural vegetation is because of the decreasing human and livestock population, changes in lifestyle, etc. The highest increase in natural vegetation in lower plain areas is because of the alternative use of cooking energy and building materials in urban and accessible areas, decreasing the number of livestock. Thus, it can be concluded that there is a significant impact of population dynamics on vegetation in the Madi Watershed of Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/53490/40066,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes (SEPLS) result in balanced interactions of nature and society with wise and adaptive management of ecosystem services and limited use of land within the carrying capacity and resilience of the ecosystem. The collective declaration of World Peace Biodiversity Park (WPBP) in the region near Pokhara is a notable example of a SEPLS. WPBP's main vision is to promote the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity based on ecotourism. With financial support from the government, local communities and the private enterprise Back to Nature, have implemented various activities, including construction of an eco-trail, restoration of a natural pond, plantation, bioengineering measures, and declaration of WPBP with a ticket house as per the management plan (2020–2024). Initiation and development of the activities of WPBP through its conservation committee have contributed to conservation and restoration of the ecosystems by reducing siltation and recharging water tables, thereby maintaining soil fertility in its first year. The capacity of local communities in ecotourism business was enhanced to offer visitors quality trekking experiences and to help retain the spending of visitors in the local economy to the extent possible. Issues such as overexploitation of natural resources, forest fires, expansion of alien invasive plant species, outmigration, and lack of appropriate institutional structures, are barriers to ecosystem restoration, and therefore should be urgently addressed to ensure greater benefit for the local and indigenous people. Private community partnerships and support from government for the WPBP declaration, underpinned by the principles of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and ecotourism principles, have contributed to the unique and sustainable landscape in accordance with the SEPLS concept based on the balanced management of land, water, and living resources. The Panchase landscape offers a great potential to blend nature and culture for ecotourism initiatives that have direct implications for ecosystem restoration. Financial, technical, and collective participation from key stakeholders based on effective implementation of a management plan is a prerequisite for realising the dream of nature-based tourism and transformation of WPBP into a ""Living Laboratory of Ecotourism.""",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-981-99-1292-6_4,,SDG 15: Life on Land

EbA comprises adaptation strategies that value the role of ecosystems in reducing social vulnerability to climate change. Among the different biological groups on earth, fungi play not only an important role to maintain the biogeochemical cycle/nutrient cycle in ecosystems (supporting and regulating services), but also contribute to the socio-economic and cultural benefits of societies (provisioning and cultural services). Here, we present our knowledge and scientific understanding on how these neglected groups of biodiversity-fungi are crucial for ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) approach based on our field experience, review and associated expertise on caterpillar fungus (Ophiocordyceps sinensis), and other wild mushrooms found in Nepal. Several species of fungi are used by local communities as food, medicines, and environmental income. Fungi are important sources of household income for mountain communities in Nepal providing a cushion during shocks and disasters and supporting food security, health care, education and building shelter. For the holistic EbA approach, it is essential to strengthen local institutions as well as indigenous local knowledge which could be an important policy intervention for the identification, conservation, and sustainable management of ecologically, socially and economically useful fungal species.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The disease affects the rural poor socio-economical community causing significant death among untreated patients (Per capita income of Nepal US $ 400.00). An effort was made to estimate treatment cost on clinically diagnosed VL patients in three VL endemic districts of Eastern development region of Nepal.Materials & Methods: During one and half year period in 2012/2013, approximately 500 cases were diagnosed as VL from three district hospitals; two zonal hospitals and one tertiary level hospital of Eastern Terai districts of Nepal. Total 172 cases were selected randomly from the three VL endemic districts of Eastern Nepal and interviewed at their homes. Results: On an average, cost for VL treatment during hospitalization was Nepali Rupees (NRS) 4032.67±313.47, where median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 17 (five to 35) days. The patients were  iagnosed symptomatically as VL after 45 ± 6 days of feeling illness. The treatment cost of patient before diagnosis was NRS 2379.93 ± 202.30. Patient reached the treatment center after 17 ± 2 days of diagnosis and referral from community level. Total 83.7% patients came for follow-up after average 30 ± 2 days of discharge with an average expense of RS 360.34 ± 49.88. The death rate of VL patients during treatment and within one month of discharge was 7.6%. It was found that the average funeral cost was NRs 9598.00 ± 1259.00. Conclusion: This study concludes that, average treatment cost for VL treatment during hospital stay was NRs 4032 and before treatment was around NRS 2380 and follow up cost was NRs 360. Early diagnosis and treatment in treatment center without significant delay can not only reduce the hospital stay and treatment cost, but also saves life of VL patients.JCMS Nepal. 2016;12(2):60-5",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JCMSN/article/download/15454/12556,,SDG 15: Life on Land

An investigation of diurnal cycle of precipitation revealed an afternoon maximum during the pre-monsoon season (March–May) and midnight–early morning maximum during the summer monsoon season (June–August)over the southern slopes of the Himalayas. The summer monsoon exhibited a robust spatial variation of diurnal cycle of precipitation, during afternoon-evening time, primary rainfall peak appeared along the Lesser Himalayas (~2,000–2,200 m above mean sea level), while early-morning rain in contrast showed maximum concentration along the southern margin of the Himalayas (~500–700 m above MSL). An afternoon-evening rainfall peak was attributed to higher rain frequency, whereas early-morning rainfall peak was attributed to fewer but rather intense rainfall.

This unique species is distinct due to its long, slender snout and being approximately twice the length of other river dolphins.As an important indicator species for the health of river ecosystems, the Gangetic Dolphin is highly sensitive to changes in water quality and habitat degradation. Unfortunately, this species is considered endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species due to various threats, including habitat loss, pollution, and accidental entanglement in fishing gear. Numerous conservation efforts are being implemented to protect this endangered species, including establishing protected areas and conservation programs to reduce pollution and promote responsible fishing practices. Nevertheless, continued conservation efforts are necessary to safeguard the future of the Gangetic Dolphin and its vital role in maintaining the health of river ecosystems.Dolphins are intelligent, social animals that play an important role in aquatic ecosystems where they live. They are top predators and help maintain the food chain's balance in the ecosystem. Additionally, many people enjoy seeing wild dolphins, which promotes tourism. Dolphins are found worldwide and in diverse aquatic environments including oceans, coastal, estuarine and freshwater - and in temperatures ranging from sub-zero to more than 30 °C. There are 36 species of marine dolphins. The most common species of marine dolphins are the Bottlenose Dolphin, the Common Dolphin, and the Orca, also known as the Killer Whale.River dolphins, on the other hand, are much rarer and found only in a few river systems worldwide. Freshwater, or river dolphins, are cetaceans living exclusively in freshwater rivers and lakes. There are several species of freshwater dolphins, each with a distinct distribution range: These include the Amazon River Dolphin: also known as the Pink River Dolphin, found in the Amazon River and its tributaries in South America, including the Orinoco, Araguaia, and Tocantins rivers. The Indus River Dolphin (Platanista minor) is found only in the Indus river system, including the Sutlej, Ravi, and Beas rivers of Pakistan and India. Baiji Dolphin: also known as the Chinese River Dolphin or Yangtze River Dolphin, was once found only in the Yangtze River in China, but unfortunately, is now considered functionally extinct. Franciscana Dolphin, also known as the La Plata, is found in the estuary of the Rio de la Plata in South America, including Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina, while the Irrawaddy Dolphin inhabits rivers and estuaries of Southeast Asia, including the Mekong River, the Irrawaddy River, and the Mahakam River in Indonesia. Platanista gangetica gangetica is localized in the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna and Sangu–Karnaphuli rivers systems in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. This species is locally known as ‘susu’ after the noise it makes when it breathes. Ganges River Dolphins, often considered the “Tiger of the Ganges”, is an indicator species with the same role in a river ecosystem as a tiger in a forest. However, it is essentially blind and relies on echolocation, which means the dolphin senses sound waves in the water to navigate, detect prey and communicate. It is estimated that there are approximately 2,500-3,000 Ganges River Dolphins left living in the wild. Furthermore, dolphins play critical ecological roles in the ecosystems they inhabit, such as controlling prey populations and maintaining the health of their habitats.As mentioned earlier, the Gangetic Dolphin is one of the world's most endangered freshwater species, with only a few thousand individuals remaining in their natural range. Their survival faces various significant challenges, including habitat degradation, pollution, illegal, destructive and overfishing, navigation, and climate change.The construction of dams, barrages, roads, water diversion and extraction projects, sand mining, dredging, navigation, and varying anthropogenic activities have caused a significant impact on the natural habitat and its fragmentation, impacting dolphins. The contamination of rivers and other water bodies with chemicals, sewage, plastics, and other pollutants causes severe threats to the health of the dolphins and their prey, leading to a decline in their population.Dolphins face accidental deaths from fishing practices such as trawling, gillnetting, and purse-seining, leading to their entanglement and drowning. They may also get caught and killed as bycatch when fishing for other species. Overfishing also depletes the availability of adequate fish for dolphins, which may result in a decline in their population. Additionally, dolphins face injuries and accidental deaths due to collisions with fishing and other boats, leading to a cascading impact on the ecosystems they inhabit.Climate change-mediated consequences, such as rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, etc., affect the flow of rivers and the availability of food and habitat for dolphins, thus impacting their survival. Navigation-mediated noise pollution causes disruptions in the dolphins’ capability to communicate and echolocate, thereby disturbing their ability to locate prey and communicate with one another. Navigation and anchoring disrupt essential dolphin habitats, which may decrease prey availability and ultimately impact the abundance of dolphins in the area.Lack of awareness and ecological education about the importance of Gangetic dolphins and their conservation among local communities, school children, other stakeholders and policymakers hinder conservation efforts. Even the loss of a few individuals can significantly impact dolphin populations, given their low reproductive rates and long lifespans, particularly in areas where their populations are already threatened or declining.The Gangetic dolphin has been declared the national aquatic animal of India and Nepal to increase conservation awareness for the endangered species. Bangladesh and Bhutan have also taken steps to protect the species. Although they have not declared this species their national aquatic animal, both countries promote sustainable tourism and watch dolphin habitats.Conservation efforts and regulatory measures are being taken to protect the Ganges river dolphin. The Indian Government has launched several programs, including the Ganges River Dolphin Conservation Action Plan and the National River Conservation Plan, to conserve the species and its habitat. These plans focus on reducing pollution in the Ganges river, the primary habitat of the dolphin, and increasing public awareness about the need to conserve this species. The Government has also established protected areas for the dolphin and has launched programs to study its behaviour and habitat. Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, Bhagirathi Dolphin Sanctuary, and the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve deserve mention. The Bangladesh government is also implementing the Dolphin Conservation Action Plan, which includes establishing protected areas and promoting ecotourism. Bangladesh has designated protected habitats for the Gangetic dolphin, including the Sundarbans, and established nine sanctuaries to protect riverine cetaceans, with a management plan for the three dolphin sanctuaries of the Sundarbans. The 20 km segment from the Halda River mouth to Sattar Ghat has been identified as a dolphin hotspot. Activities harmful to dolphins and their habitats are strictly monitored and prevented in these areas. The Nepalese Government has established protected areas like Bardia National Park and the Karnali River Dolphin Conservation Reserve. Non-government and Government-led conservation organizations are collaborating to raise public awareness and implement community-based conservation programs about the importance of conserving dolphins and implementing sustainable fishing practices. Research is ongoing to better understand the species distribution, population size, and potential threats. Bhutan, where the Gangetic dolphin is not a resident or endemic species, is equally committed to conserving aquatic biodiversity and has taken steps to protect its riverine habitats and species. In Bhutan, the Government and organizations like the Royal Society for Protection of Nature are committed to conserving aquatic biodiversity and have conducted surveys to assess the population and distribution of river dolphins. While no dolphins were sighted in the Mangdechhu river, further studies are recommended to understand the species’ status in Bhutan.Conservation efforts are directed towards reducing dolphin bycatch, including implementing fishing gear and fishing practices regulations, educating fishermen on responsible fishing practices, and establishing protected areas. Responsible navigation practices minimize disturbance and avoid sensitive habitats to promote dolphin health and abundance. Reductions in boat traffic may increase the availability of food and ease of catching prey for dolphins. Other factors, such as changes in environmental conditions, may also impact dolphins and require further research.Several regulations have been implemented in the region to conserve these rare creatures. These include: The Wildlife Protection Act of India (1972, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Life_(Protection)_Act,_1972) protects the Gangetic dolphin under Schedule I and prohibits hunting, poaching, capturing, or killing any wild animal, including dolphins.The National River Conservation Plan, launched by the Indian Government to conserve and manage rivers and their ecosystems, with a focus on the conservation of the Gangetic dolphin and its habitat.International agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention on Migratory Species, signed by South Asian countries to protect the Gangetic dolphin and other endangered species in the region. These agreements provide a framework for cooperation between countries in conserving these species and their habitats.The Gangetic river dolphin is endangered in Bangladesh and protected under the Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act of 2012.In Bhutan, the species is considered sacred and protected under the Forest and Nature Conservation Act.In Nepal, gill nets, a significant threat to the Gangetic dolphin, have been banned in areas where the species is found.Conserving the Gangetic Dolphin is challenging and requires collaboration between governments, conservation organizations, and local communities. Implementing these regulations and working together can ensure the survival of these amazing creatures for future generations.River Dolphins are considered indicators of ecosystem health in river basins. Recent reports in newspapers and social media, although qualitative and descriptive in nature, have highlighted the awareness about probable impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on the changing riverine ecosystem health and the population of dolphins. The pandemic has significantly impacted human health and socio-economic conditions worldwide; the virus quickly spread across the globe, leading to millions of infections and deaths and overwhelming healthcare systems. Social distancing measures, such as lockdowns and quarantines, have been implemented to slow the spread of the virus but have had significant socio-economic impacts, such as widespread job losses, business closures, and reduced economic activity. This reduction in economic activity appears to have led to impacts on the aquatic environment and biodiversity. Reducing human activities, such as travel and transportation, navigation and fishing, has reduced pollution. It is reported in India that the water quality of the Ganges river has improved due to a reduction in the anthropogenic activities.Sincere efforts are underway in India and neighbouring countries of South Asia to protect the endangered Gangetic river dolphin. These efforts include implementing water quality standards, conserving and restoring river habitats, and reducing fishing and human-induced disturbances. Several protected areas have been established in India and other neighbouring countries. Habitat conservation is a key component of India's “Namami Ganga Programme”. Local communities are being targeted through conservation education programs to raise awareness and mobilize their active participation in complying with existing acts and regulations to prohibit activities that negatively impact dolphins. Certain international and regional agreements have been signed to support conservation efforts. Research is also being conducted to better understand the species’ ecology and behaviour. Such forward-looking and proactive conservation measures aim to prevent the extinction of the Gangetic River Dolphin and increase its population. However, more must be done to ensure the long-term health of the river systems and the species that dwell in them. This needs implementation of an organized collection of quantitative experimental scientific data to document the response of dolphins to changing physical, chemical and biological conditions of the ecosystem.In order to enhance our knowledge and research about the ecology of dolphins a webinar was convened from August 24–25, 2020 sponsored by IFSI, ICAR-CIFRI, NMCG, PFGF, India and AEHMS, Canada: Exploring the impact of COVID-19 on the ecosystem health of rivers and its dolphin population: Present status and future strategy for conservation in India-Bangladesh-Myanmar-Nepal. The event led to the publication of this special issue of Aquatic Ecosystem Health and Management due to the persistent efforts of the AEHMS.Now there is a need to consider holding a follow-up workshop with the suggested theme of “Uniting for the Survival of the South Asian River Dolphin: Conservation Strategies for an Endangered Species.” Such a workshop would provide a platform to report scientific research, deliberate and discuss the progress made post-webinar period, and conceptualize a collaborative regional initiative appropriate for the critical nature of the South Asian River Dolphin's survival. Such a workshop would also invite innovative conservation strategies for freshwater river dolphins with enhanced use of emerging technology, including tagging to track their movements and habitat use via satellites, acoustic monitoring to estimate population size, community-based conservation involving fishing reduction and educational outreach programs, AI (artificial intelligence) to analyze satellite imagery data for habitat identification, and DNA analysis for population structure and genetic diversity. These innovations would enhance our understanding of the ecology of river dolphins towards planning more effective conservation projects in the future.Thanks are due to Dr. B.K. Das of CIFRI and various sponsors for initiating the webinar and Dr. M. Munawar, AEHMS for organizing this special issue. The reviews and revisions by Drs. Martin Van der Knaap and Mohiuddin Munawar, and meticulous editing by Jennifer Lorimer and Susan Blunt of AEHMS improved the original version of this prelude and is greatly appreciated.",https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/msup/aehm/article-pdf/26/1/3/1990739/3prelude.pdf,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Phenomenologists concentrate on the structures of consciousness as individuals experienced and expressed while turning an objective world or phenomenon into a subjective one through objectivation, internalization and externalization/ institutionalization process. The structuralist holds that the creation of an institution is a reproduction of interaction between structures and actors. And other theorists (e.g., Leach et al., 1999; Ostrom 2005, 2009; Gupta et al., 2010; Young, 2010) consider that institutions for natural resources conflate with social institutions and mediate their relations. Although these theories are not explicit epistemologically in a pragmatic sense, they have indicated language, rules, (embedded) practices and knowledge are the referential artifacts of institutions. These theories are found applicable in the institutionalization/socialization history of CF as it had gone through the social rejection (i.e, objectivation) during the 1970s, internalization during the 1980s, and socialization of it during and after the 1990s. The socialization of CF after the 1990s was due to the formation of CF as a social space (a ‘structure’ or ‘institution’) to discuss social and environmental issues into one place where forest dependent users (‘actors’) rationalize the use of forest and its conservation for local environment in a more pragmatic sense (i.e., mediate people-nature relations). An institution for natural resources is, therefore, the combined perspectives of phenomenologists, structuralists, and those who think institutions as a mediator of people-nature relations. Thus, an institution is political (i.e., relations and interactions) and ecological/economic (i.e., access to natural resources, livelihood practices).",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/35547/27788,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The study demonstrates the comparison between different options to deal with flood and make a sound decision, based on economic rationale for long-term benefits. The present study compares ecosystem based adaptation options with engineering options using cost benefit analysis in order to protect village from flooding. Through stakeholder and expert consultations, ecosystem based adaptation options and economic options that are feasible in the village and catchment to mitigate the floods were listed. Economic analysis of these options and the different combinations were done using cost benefit analysis. Analysis was carried out for each of the different combination of options. Focus on ecosystem based adaptation options provide high benefit to cost return in terms of avoided damages and considering engineering options efficient in flood and erosion control in initial stage in spite of its high cost. The study suggests that reforestation in upland forest areas; plantation along riverbed and management of rangeland should be prioritized.

The process is key to sustainable forestry and can be accomplished through natural regeneration, which occurs when new seedlings or sprouts are produced by trees left on or near the site. The study is to calculate the regeneration status of the tree species in community-managed forests. The sampling points were generated by using the random table. The sample quadrate size was taken 20m×20m for a tree, 5m×5m for a sapling, and 1m×1m for the seedling. In five community forests, altogether 30 quadrates were taken for a tree, 60 nested quadrates were taken for a sapling and 120 nested quadrates were taken for a seedling. The tree layer, sapling layer and seedling layer were differentiated by taking reference tothe Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) class. An individual having DBH ≥ 5cm is considered a tree, an individual having DBH value between 1cm to < 5cm is considered a sapling, and individuals having 1cm to < 5cm DBH are considered as a seedling. The DBH distribution curve was obtained by plotting diameter class in x- axis and density on y- axis. All studied community forests are mixed forest dominated by tree species Castanopsis indica, Diospyros embryopteris (Diospyros malabarica), Shorea robusta, and Schima wallichii (Schima wallichii choisy). The regeneration potential of the Tilahar community forest(CF) is found high despite high grazing and other human intervention.

Parcel fragmentation is the division of a parcel into two or more parcels. This research was carried out to analyse the current status of parcel fragmentation in Nepal. According to the findings of this research, parcel fragmentation in Nepal is haphazard mainly focussing on urban and peri urban arears consequently parcel being irregular in shape & smaller in size and ultimately incrementing huge number of land owners with in fixed area. In the context of Nepal, factors that drive parcel fragmentation are cultural, social, legal, economical, frequent disasters, geographic variations, unmanaged migrations, haphazard land use planning amongst others. The uncontrolled and unmanaged parcel fragmentation in Nepal is the major challenge for land use planning and its implementation. Dense parcel fragmentation has created land related disputes. it is recommended that the government should reformulate and implement the proper land use policy as well as its supporting acts that encourage landconsolidation in agricultural zone and reducing haphazard parcel fragmentation in urban and peri urban areas.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJG/article/download/50885/38021,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Objectives: In the current constraint of poor availability of such information, National Census Sample Survey information was utilized to understand the mortality pattern of major forms of injuries in relation to all diseases. Methods: A nationally representative sample was drawn from six districts and 52 municipalities as a part of national census sample survey. The instrument included respondent-reported deaths in the family, the cause of death, the age and sex. Results: The national representative information on the pattern of diseases shows that there were7,010 deaths as a result of the external causes of injuries (4,803 males and 2,207 females) in a period of one year prior to the survey in 2001. Suicides, transport related accidents and other accidents accounted for the largest proportion of injuries. Other accidents ranked sixth, suicide 9th and transport accidents 10th leading cause of death for both sexes and all diseases. Conclusion: Injuries accounted for as many number of death as tuberculosis and many times more than malaria or HIV/AIDS in Nepal.

Fires, floods, landslides and epidemics are the most frequent hazard events, which have cumulatively caused a significant loss of lives and property every year. However, due to diversity in physiographic, climatic and socio-economic conditions within the country, the type, frequency and degree of the impact of such events differs in different places.

Nepal’s response to the US-led Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) signifies the same. For Nepal, crossing seas was culturally associated with sin as an objective to fulfill the isolationist policy adopted until the political change of 1950. As such, Nepal’s interaction with the sea was not so friendly in the past. However, these historical shreds of evidence cannot suffice as the reason behind her denial of joining the IPS. Most of the available literature divulges the sensitive geographical position of Nepal in the context of the rise of China and the projection of a ‘new Cold War’ for its reluctance to join the Indo-Pacific strategy. However, they fail to probe into the domestic intricacies contributing to the hesitation. In this context, this paper primarily tries to dwell upon the actors and factors that have influenced Nepal’s dubiety in joining the Indo-Pacific Strategy. Thus, this paper aims to fulfill two objectives. First, to analyze the role of geographical sensitivity, and second, to scrutinize the domestic interplay of things.

Improper visualization of primary fistulous tract and the associated abscesses or secondary tracts a r e the causes of recurrence. Earlier imaging modalities like conventional fistulography, endosonography and CT scan have had limited role. Even without endorectal coils, 3T MRI has multi-planar imaging capability and excellent soft tissue differentiation to show perianal anatomy, primary and secondary tracts with associated abscesses in relation to sphincter complex. It provides excellent road map to surgeons for preoperative evaluation. The objective of the study was to evaluate the role of 3T MR in imaging of perianal fistulas. Methods: A retrospective study was done among 32 patients who were referred for MR fistulogram for suspected perianal fistula at Jeebanta Advanced Kathmandu Imaging, Durbar Marg, Kathmandu, Nepal. All images and findings were obtained and recorded with the help of Philips Ingenia 3T digital broadband MR scanner. Imaging was performed in oblique coronal and oblique axial plane. MR images were studied and grading system was applied according to the St James’s University Hospital Classification. The data were entered in a performa and was analyzed using IBM SPSS V21. Results: Male to female ratio was 7:1. According to St. James University Hospital MR Imaging classification of perianal fistulas, most of the patients (25%) had Grade 4 followed by (12.5% each) Grade 0, Grade 1 and Grade 2 and (6.3% each) Grade 3 and Grade 5 fistulas. Mean age was 37.28 years (Std. deviation 11.9). Common internal opening in axial image was found at 5 0’ clock positions (31.3%). Mean length of the fistulous tract was 3.9 cm (Std. deviation 2.3). Conclusion: Perianal fistulas are more common in males and Grade 4 fistulas are the commonest.

Nepal has hitherto adopted an isolated and sectoral silo policy approach to development planning that has remained the dominant mode of planning across many countries in the world with few exceptions until recently when inadequacies of sectoral planning became apparent. The search for alternatively more integrative approaches came into the forefront of development discourse in the backdrop of shrinking natural resources, climate change, inexorable demand of a rapidly growing urban population, and other needs and requirements at a global scale.   The river basin-wide W-E-F-E nexus development policy strategy offers significant potential for optimum water resource utilization driving development of all sectors, including agriculture. The fundamental aspect of the W-E-F-E nexus policy framework entails the understanding of interdependencies and interactions amidst its components (water, energy, food, and ecosystem) and assessing their synergistic impacts on food, energy, water, and environmental securities in the basin. The W-E-F-E nexus policy framework aims to harness the synergy created from the interaction of interlinked components to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). This paper argues that Nepal government must carefully weigh the pros and cons of designing singular run-of-river mega hydro-project visa-vis multipurpose water reservoir projects with provisions of integrating irrigation, drinking water, inland waterways, and flood control infrastructures besides hydro-energy leveraging W-E-F-E nexus relationship.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

If one looks at the total quantum of water that flows out of Nepal in one year, the above message sounds valid but as the flow of water is not under anybody’s control and flow occurs under gravity as it precipitates or exits the water springs, it should be considered in two dimensions: volume and time. In my opinion, Nepal is water stressed most of the time of year: flood stressed during the monsoon and drought stressed during the rest of the year. Nepal is rich in ice-mass, which is depleting at an alarming rate due to global warming giving rise to formation and increase in volume of glacial lakes that increases the vulnerability and risks to the economic activities along the river basins. Similarly, Nepal is rich ing round water resource with the total annual replenish able reserve of about 12 BCM mostly located in the Terai plains. The most debatable is the surface water that mostly falls as rain during the monsoon and cascades down crossing into India, is often devastating, as it passes. Nepal’s water resource is generally related to its hydropower potential calculated as 83,000MW by Dr. Hari Man Shrestha back in the sixties. Hydropower potential is a number that is based on the energy potential and the market, therefore, it is changing from time to time due to change in demand pattern and the market rates. Myopic view of looking at the Himalayan waters relating it to energy production as the energy production (TAF-June 2018) comprises a meager percentage of total benefit which lies mostly on multiple use of water directed towards the following two aspects: (1)Reduction in the losses of life and property due to floods and unwanted mountain phenomenon, mostly flood related disaster risk reduction, and (2) Flood Water management for converting the curse of floods into assets by way of its multiple uses, both consumptive as well as non-consumptive including food revolution, navigation, fishery, water supply, replenishment of ground water, energy production and recreation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/24569/20671,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Research related to these risk behaviors especially among adolescents is essential considering their role as future citizens of the country.Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the burden of cardiovascular risk behavior amongst the adolescents of Kaski district, Lekhnath Nepal.Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out among the adolescents of Lekhnath Muncipality Kaski District. Total 350 participants from five different schools from Lekhnath Muncipality took part in the study and the sampling technique was simple random method by using a random number table. Self administered questionnaires were used to collect information on identification of risk behaviors.Results: Descriptive statistics and Chi square test were computed. Out of 350 adolescents 175 males and remaining 175 females were interviewed. Alcohol and tobacco consumption were more amongst males whereas fast food and soft drinks were more amongst the females. Nearly 40% of the adolescents were not involved in physical activity. Tobacco and alcohol consumption was 26% and 16% respectively, which was higher amongst the late adolescents group studying in the 11th and 12th standard. In this study fruits and vegetables consumption was very less only 42% whereas soft drinks and fast food consumption was more 83% which shows that the adolescents are not aware about their food habits. Some participants did not consume fruits due to low purchasing power to buy fruits. Adolescence is a period of experimentation and so some participants told that they have just started taking alcohol and also started consuming tobacco for fun and were not aware that it was cardiovascular risk behavior.Conclusions: The adolescents had a high burden of cardiovascular risk behavior and if immediate intervention is not done to reduce these high risk behaviors many may be vulnerable to cardio vascular diseases in the future. J-GMC-N | Volume 11 | Issue 01 | January-June 2018, Page: 10-13",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/20787/17069,,SDG 15: Life on Land

As Nepal is in the process of implementing federalization, assessment of land tenure security shall be one of the instruments for developing new land related policies and assessing the effect of new policies afterward. The objective of this paper is to perform SWOT analysis on the status of land tenure security in Nepal by reviewing the history of the tenure system and current tenure system, studying country reports and research papers and analyzing policies and institutions. The study shows that despite some initiatives by government, NGOs, bilateral agencies and media to improve land tenure security, land tenure insecurity prevails in all areas of the country even in registered lands. It is found that stable  rganization, registration of most of the built-up and cultivated land, advocacy to protect the right of landless has strengthened the land tenure security. However, the tenure rights of socially and economically disadvantaged people and displaced people from disasters have not been properly addressed and those people are at high risk of eviction from the place they are living. The study recommends that land tenure insecurity arising from political, legislative and organizational behavior should be managed by appropriate interventions and policy reforms.

We collected information from locals living near the Ramsar site using focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and household (HH) surveys. We identified five invasive alien plants in the Ramsar sites in Pokhara Valley. A total of 18 ecosystem services were recorded from discussions with residents living near the Ramsar sites. Our study found that the economic benefits generated from the provisioning service, calculated based on the market price in the year of data collection, were worth a total of International$ 9.05 million. The value of provisioning services was International$ 0.1 million HH−1 year−1. Our estimate showed that the value of provisioning services before the occurrence of invasive alien plants in 1989 was International$ 0.19 million HH−1 year−1 higher than in 2019. Those who benefit from the Lake clusters mentioned that the invasive alien plants led to a decrease in economically important plants such as medicine and fruits and decreased fish production. Other impacts have included: reduced natural beauty, loss of biodiversity, and obstruction of recreational boating, which has discouraged tourism in recent years, among other impacts. Our results show that the rampant spread of invasive alien plants has a severe impact on ecosystem services. The impact on the associated economic value is alarming.

In the countries of South-East Asia region, Kala-azar occurs mainly in three countries- India, Bangladesh and Nepal. The disease occurs in agricultural villages where houses are frequently constructed with mud walls. Even people residing in endemic areas have poor practices for its prevention. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 150 community people of Katahari Gaupalika, Morang. Simple Random sampling technique was used for the selection of three wards among seven wards, probability proportionate was used for the selection of the population from the ward. The desired sample was selected purposively. Data were collected from face-to-face interview techniques using a structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done by using SPSS 16 version. Results It is found that nearly two-thirds of the respondents (63.3%) had moderate awareness, more than one-fifth (22%) of the respondents had adequate awareness while (14.7%) of the respondents had inadequate awareness of Kala-azar. Similarly, more than half (55.3%) had moderate preventive practice, (25.3%) had inadequate preventive practice and nearly one-fifth (19.3%) had adequate preventive practice. The mean score for awareness and practice was 16.633 and 5.54 respectively. Conclusion The study was conducted to assess the level of awareness of Kala-azar. This concluded moderate awareness of respondents on Kala-azar which suggested that there is still a need to improve the awareness of the respondents particularly on its causative agent, preventive measures and complication. However, to improve their awareness to an adequate level, awareness-raising programs focusing on preventive practice should be conducted",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Based on epidemiological records the DENV-1 and DENV-2 serotypes have traditionally been the most incriminated serovars in terms of national disease burden according to the Epidemiology and the disease control division (EDCD). Since the beginning of January 2022 up until the 28th of September 2022 over 28000 cases of confirmed and suspected cases of dengue fever have been reported to the WHO with a total of 38 deaths being documented across all of Nepal’s provinces. To date the predominant implicated serotype or serotypes have not been identified. The province most adversely affected is the Bagmati province which accounts for 78.2% of the cases and 68.4% of the fatalities noted in Nepal. A further rise in cases has been noted as of the 8th of August 2022. This dengue outbreak is the largest recorded outbreak within the small mountainous regions recent history. The latest data released by the Ministry of health and population of Nepal (11th December 2022), has recorded a total of 54232 cases with the Bagmati province accounting for 42143 thereof and Lumbini province 4984 respectively.

The Ramaroshan Wetland Complex (RWC) of Achham District, Nepal is one of the high-altitude wetlands facing human induced degradation and loss. Herpetofauna are key bio-indicators of environmental health and habitat quality and are useful to assess habitat conditions of such threatened ecosystems. This study quantified the land use and land cover (LULC) change in the RWC and documented the diversity and distribution pattern of herpetofauna. The LULC in the area (13.94 Km2) was analyzed for 1989, 2000, 2010 and 2021 by supervised classification of remote sensing images. Surveys were conducted along 25 transects, each of 200 m in length and environmental variables were recorded for every observation of herpetofauna. The LULC analysis revealed an overall loss of 16% of the total water body between 1989 (0.25 Km2) and 2021 (0.21 Km2). Eleven species of herpetofauna (five amphibians and six reptiles) within five families and two orders (i.e., Anura and Squamata), were recorded with low diversity (H’ = 1.88312) and evenness (E = 0.3642) indices. The herpetofauna had a hump-shaped distribution along the elevation gradient with the highest richness and abundance at 2300 m asl. Amphibian abundance decreased with increasing distance to nearest water sources, whereas reptile abundance increased. Amphibians were more abundant in agricultural field and marsh land, whereas reptile abundance was higher around human settlements. Results indicate that the wetland area in the RWC is declining at an alarming rate and, in turn, might account for the low diversity and abundance of the herpetofauna.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/1/135/pdf,,SDG 15: Life on Land

However, this foodstuff may be contaminated with heavy metals from the raw ingredients, production, and packaging methods, which could bring serious health issues. Therefore, this study aimed to determine cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (FAAS) in a total of thirty-seven different brands of milk-based, cocoa-based, and sugar-based chocolates available in local grocery shops of Kathmandu city, Nepal and to evaluate associated health risks in children and adults using USEPA deterministic approaches. The results revealed concentrations of Cd, Ni, and Pb in the range of 0.021 – 0.585, 1.90 – 7.24, and 0.57 – 4.29 mg/kg respectively in studied chocolates and an overall mean concentration of 0.199, 4.22, and 1.94 mg/kg respectively. The observed concentrations exceeded the maximum permissible limits set by FAO/WHO (2001). A higher concentration of all studied metals was found in cocoa-based chocolate compared to milk-based and sugar-based chocolates. The positive and significant correlations (p < 0.05) among Cd, Ni, and Pb in studied chocolates indicate the possibility of contamination from common sources. Similarly, the estimated ADDing values were higher for all metals in cocoa-based chocolate for both children and adults. However, children were more prone to metals exposure than adults since their dietary intake was higher than adults. Cocoa-based chocolate in this study posed a non-carcinogenic risk to both children and adults since their hazard index (HI) values exceeded the acceptable limit (>1.0). In addition, Cd and Ni posed carcinogenic risks to both receptor groups through the consumption of all three categories of chocolate. Therefore, this study suggested the use of less contaminated raw materials in chocolates as well as regular monitoring of the production chain as an attempt to ensure the quality and safety of the food products.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNCS/article/download/62680/47334,,SDG 15: Life on Land

During the same period, in Himal, ESV was also found lowest i.e. 1.13×109 USD yr-1. The ESV has increased in all provinces except in Karnali, Madhesh province and among all physiographic regions ESV has decreased in High Mountains and Himal in between 2000 and 2019. The climate study showed that temperature has increased by 0.02 oCyr-1 and precipitation has decreased by -3.95 mmyr-1 during 1990-2020 in Nepal. These changes of temperature, precipitation and land use dynamics have influenced on ecosystem changes and consequent ecosystem service values in national, provincial and ecological scales.

With early detection and management, lives of many children can be saved, eyes can be preserved and vision can be restored. The study was aimed at finding out the clinical features, methods of management and outcome of the disease in a tertiary eye care centre of institute of medicine in Nepal. Methods: A prospective case series study was done between 2014 -2017 at BP Koirala Lions Centre for Ophthalmic Studies, Institute of medicine, Nepal. The diagnosis of retinoblastoma was made on the basis of history and clinical examination. Additional information was obtained from radiological procedure whenever required. International classification of retinoblastoma (Shields) was used to clinically classify the retinoblastoma lesion and the management depended on the stage of the disease. Results: A total of 36 patients with retinoblastoma fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study, 23 males and 13 females with sex ratio: 0.57. Median age at diagnosis was 36±13.825 months. In 19.4% of cases the disease was bilateral. Leukocoria, red eye and proptosis were common signs observed in 46.5%, 33.3 % and 16.3% of case respectively. Enucleation and exenteration were the commonest modality of treatment. Six patients died during the course of treatment and during follow up period and 8 patients were lost before one year of follow up. Conclusions: Despite the advances in the field of retinoblastoma, the prognosis still remains poor due to delay in presentation in our centre.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/823/739,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Long-term comparison (four years) of the plant at Sundhara and the same system comparison of plants at Pokhara and Biratnagar were performed. Long-term analysis of the plant at Sundhara found that the final yield decreased from 2.91 kWh/kWp in 2019 to 2.21 kWh/kWp in 2022. Similarly, the performance ratio decreased from 91.0% in 2019 to 67.3% in 2022, capacity utilization factor decreased from 12.1% in 2019 to 9.2% in 2022, and system efficiency decreased from 16.8% in 2019 to 12.5% in 2022.  The same system installed at Pokhara and Biratnagar had slightly varied performance owing to the variation in meteorological parameters. The average air temperature at Biratnagar (26.7°C) was higher than at Pokhara (13.1°C) while the amount of solar radiation at Biratnagar was just higher by 4%. This led to the reduction of final yield by 9% at Biratnagar than at Pokhara as higher temperatures at Biratnagar caused more reduction in the power output from the solar panels.

Altogether, plants belong to 76 distinct plant species from 49 phylogenetic families: 56 are used to cure 61 ailments, 27 for rituals, 25 for food, 20 for timber, 17 for fuel, 17 for fodder, 11 for soil enhancement, and eight for pesticides. Four caste groups have statistically different knowledge, and younger informants report a lower average number of useful plants. Conclusion: Agricultural landscapes in Nepal are reservoirs of biodiversity. The knowledge of the use of wild and tended plant species in and around these farms differs by the caste and age group of land manager. Conducting research on agroecosystems will contribute to a deeper understanding of how nature is perceived by locals, to more efficient management and conservation of the breadbasket of Nepal, and to the conservation of valuable, but disappearing traditional knowledge and practice.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13002-020-00382-4.pdf,,SDG 15: Life on Land

As time pass by, new emerging health problems, shifting of epidemiological trends in disease patterns, rapid increase in population, new and emerging health problems, increasing commercial interests of private health sector and shrinking resources all contribute in inequity to health care.2  Hence it is extremely important that research addresses priorities and focuses on the most important health issues and conditions. Research must serve as a driver for health system, policies and practice. For this to happen, the health research systems should be fully accountable for sake of transparency and also have to be capable of delivering the desired returns. We are fortune to take benefit from documented experiences from history. The main goal of medical research article is to share one’s valuable experience so as to contribute to the progress of science.3  Conducting a medical research and publishing it in a medical journal, is sharing an important knowledge and experience to the world. A physician from one part of the world may have significant load of certain disease and sharing management experience in that particular disease may help doctors of other part of the world treat such kind of patient. Furthermore, author may also have individual benefits, like higher positions in academic hierarchy.4  The Journal of the institution reflects the academics wealth of the institute. Earlier, only few used to grab opportunities for professional growth via publication, majority of them suffer to lack of publication culture in the institution resulting in fossilization of their professional caliber.5  In developing countries like ours, to do quality medical research is often difficult. Furthermore, getting the article published in medical journal is another challenge. Leading international medical journals underreport on health research priorities for developing countries because of improper material, methods quality. Many factors play role in the paucity of inclusion of research papers from developing countries. Lack of resources like funding, proper man power and less access to scientific literature in similar setting leading to poor research output, faulty manuscript preparation and language proficiency may be the common problems. Inadequate laboratory facilities and training may be the other cause. Hence, researchers in developing countries should be supported and encouraged to produce material of the quality by proper guidance and required trainings. Open access journal is the window to the research world. It is one of the tools to increase publications. These journals facilitate the publication of local research output and may play defining role in helping researcher to improve their publication records, and make it accessible to other researchers. This type of open access journal is an important entity in national publishing that will hopefully gain broader prominence as awareness increases and the above efforts are implemented. To make our journal an index and of international stature is strenuous but with the help from our fraternity, we will surely reach the goal soon. Our journal will surely serve as a medium to access information, updated knowledge and a symbol of ideal journal in Nepal.  This journal is the result of hard work, dedication and sacrifice.

Disturbance-dependent grasslands, often associated with hydromorphological and fire dynamics, are threatened, especially in subtropical climates. In the Nepalese and Indian Terai Arc Landscape at the foot of the Himalayas, natural and cultural grasslands serve a viable role for rhinos (Rhinoceros unicornis) and the prey of the Royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris). The grasslands are vulnerable for encroachment of forest. We aimed to establish the effects of environmental drivers, in particular river discharge, river channel dynamics, precipitation, and forest fires, on space-time dynamics of these grasslands. The study area is the floodplain of the eastern branch of the Karnali River and adjacent western part of Bardia National Park. We created two annual time series of land cover with the use of field data, remotely sensed LANDSAT imagery and a supervised classification model. Additionally, we analysed aerial photographs of 1964 and the pattern of grassland patches. From 1964 to 2019, grasslands saw a transition to forest and grassland patches decreased in size and number. Outside the floodplain, successional setbacks of grassland coincide with extreme precipitation events. Within the floodplain, successional setbacks of grassland correlate with the magnitude of the annual peak discharge. However, this relationship is absent after 2009 due to a westward shift of the main discharge channel of the bifurcated Karnali River with a vast expansion of alluvial tall grasslands (Saccharum spontaneum dominant) as consequence. Since 2009, hydromorphological processes in the floodplain have become more static. This is supported by an observed decrease in water coverage (-53 %) in the dry season, an absence of successional setbacks, and decreased morphodynamics of river channels. For forest fires, the surface area that annually burns is observed to be more variable in recent years and the maximum extent affected by fires is in an increasing trend. Because the hydromorphological processes in the floodplain have become more static, other sources of disturbances – ephemeral streams, anthropogenic maintenance, grazing and fires – are more paramount to prevent encroachment of grasslands. Altogether, our findings underscore that a change in the environmental drivers impact the surface area and heterogeneity of grassland patches in the landscape, which can lead to cascading effects for the grassland-dependent fauna.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The related wave of research has thus turned to analysis of the dynamics of contentious politics from a comparative perspective. Unfortunately, these studies use country level datasets for their analysis, creating a mismatch between the original actor-based theoretical framework and the empirical conceptualization of contentious collective action. We discuss the conceptual challenges this theoretical-empirical gap generates and highlight how contentious dynamics can be studied with a bottom-up sub-national approach. To do so, we present a new fine-grained dataset of contentious collective action in post-conflict Nepal (2007 to 2010). We descriptively show how this type of data can help us improve our understanding of repertoires of contentious politics. This paper highlights the relevance of gathering information on active organizations to study the inherent dynamics of contentious politics.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Indeed, it is remarkable that cartooning has endured, and even made advancements, given the topsy-turvy world of Nepalese government and politics. However, as the chapter shows, cartoonists faced some harrowing situations in the closing years of the millennium, when there were many changes of political administration, a Maoist military movement, and emergency periods.

It is the most common cause of unilateral corneal blindness which is a major public health concern for developing countries. Incidence of microbial keratitis in Nepal is higher (799/100000 per year) compared to developed countries like United States (11/100000 per year) due to varying epidemiological factors. Early clinical diagnosis, initiation of proper antibiotic therapy, identification of causative microorganism and management of predisposing factors together are necessary for rapid recovery and prevention of severe visual loss.  Methods: This was a retrospective study of all consecutive patients diagnosed with suspected microbial keratitis and subjected to corneal scrapping in Cornea Department of Rapti Eye Hospital who attended during November 2021 to October 2022. The major outcome measures studied were predisposing factors, microbial spectrum, antibiotic sensitivity, treatment outcomes and surgical interventions required. Results: A total of 68 eyes of 68 cases diagnosed with microbial keratitis and subjected to corneal scrapping were enrolled in the study. Mean age of the study participants was 49.6 ± 19.6 years and male to female ratio was 1.96:1. Ocular trauma was the most common predisposing factor (48.5% of cases) followed by use of steroid.

Full immunisation is a state of obtaining all vaccination according to the Immunisation schedule of Nepal. Methods: The secondary data of Nepal was downloaded from the DHS Program. A total of 1709 children aged 16-23 months were analysed for descriptive statistics. All the analyses were weighted by its sampling weight. The full immunisation status indicates those who completed 1 dose of BCG, 3 doses of Polio, 3 doses of DPT and 1 dose of Measles. The independent variables are further subdivided into enabling, predisposing and external environmental factors. Results: Over half of children (52.6%) were from Terai, nearly a quarter (23.0%) from province 2. More males (53.5%) and the majority of (86.1%) children with birth order one to three were immunised. Mother aged < 20 years (62%), working father (96.1%), working mother (59.7%), educated father (87.3%) and educated mother (70.7%) had children with complete immunisation.

The prevalence of malocclusion is highly variable and its range is very wide and heterogeneous. Aims and Objectives: To assess the prevalence of various malocclusion traits and to evaluate the orthodontic treatment need based on the Dental Health Component (DHC) of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) among the patients visiting the College of Medical Sciences (COMS), Bharatpur, Chitwan. Materials and Method: A total of 530 patients visiting dental OPD, College of Medical Sciences, Bharatpur, Chitwan were included in this study among which 288 were male and 242 were female patients. Out of the total 530 subjects, malocclusion was observed in 359 individuals. Therefore, all subsequent results and fidings reported in the study are based on these 359 subjects exclusively. Intraoral examination was carried out to assess malocclusion based on Angle’s classifiation, overjet, overbite, open bite, crowding, spacing, and crossbite. The statistical test employed in the study was the Chi-Square test, which was utilized to assess the presence of a signifiant difference. Result: The present study showed that Class I (55.2%), malocclusion  was most prevalent followed by Class II (40.9%) and then Class III (3.9%). Increased overjet (41.2%), deep overbite (40.7%), anterior crowding (70.8%), midline spacing (17.5%), and anterior crossbite (16.4%) were more prevalent occlusal traits. DHC (Dental Health Component) of IOTN (Index of Orthodontic Treatment Needs) showed more in grades 1 and 2 (61.88%) followed by grades 4 and 5 (26.03%).

This study evaluated spring’s five physicochemical data (pH, EC, TDS, DO and temperature) for 75 springs in two seasons (pre and post monsoon). The aim of the research presented in this paper is to assess physicochemical parameters of spring water, understand their seasonal and spatial variation and the factors controlling the variation. Physicochemical parameters were correlated with each other to understand the processes and an attempt has been made to understand groundwater processes studying the physicochemical parameters. Groundwater is slightly acidic to slightly alkaline with pH ranging from 5.5 to 7.5 and is weakly to very weakly mineralized with EC range of 21.6–234.0 μS/cm in pre-monsoon and 10.5–189.8 μS/cm in post-monsoon. TDS ranged between 5.3–116.9 mg/l and 10.8–94.9 mg/l, DO between 3.1–9.4 mg/l and 2.4–7.3 mg/l and groundwater temperature between 18.4–27.9°C and 19.2–27.4°C in pre-monsoon and post monsoon season respectively. TDS and EC are noted to be higher in pre-monsoon whereas pH, DO and temperature are comparatively higher in post-monsoon. The south-east region of the study area shows minimum groundwater temperature. Minimum concentration of EC and TDS were observed in south-east and north-west part of the study area with values increasing towards the river valley. Groundwater temperature shows inverse relation with elevation, pH and DO while correlated with EC and TDS of groundwater in the region. The measured parameters were seasonally and spatially variable. The results indicate difference for measured physicochemical parameters mainly caused due to results generated by cumulative interactions of monsoonal rain, atmospheric temperature, rock-groundwater interaction, residence time of groundwater and seasonal influences. The change in parameters with respect to elevation and relation between different parameters shows shallow aquifer-related groundwater processes.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57917/43296,,SDG 15: Life on Land

A traumatic experience of an unprecedented decade long armed conflict in Nepal between government security force and Maoist insurgents between 1996-2005 forced people migrate to the safer zones for their livelihood security, particularly in the urban areas like Kathmandu. As a consequence an increase in landlessness, joblessness, homelessness, livelihood insecurity, and disruption of the social fabric have been noticed. Now the country is in the post-conflict phase. This study, therefore, seeks to explore coping strategies of the poor people residing in Kathmandu in post-conflict phase by using primary data collected from sampled household based on multi-stage sampling procedures. Livelihood of the poor people is highly influenced by the armed conflict in the past. But the post-conflict phase is characterized by increasing mobility, expanding knowledge and opportunities.

Although breastfeeding is almost universal in Nepal, ranges of regional differences in timely initiation of breastfeeding have been documented. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalance and the determinants of early initiation of breastfeeding among disadvantaged ethnic women in Midwest Nepal. Methods: The data was obtained from a household survey of women who had their last child less than one year of age. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze respondents’ demographic, socioeconomic, obstetric and health services related characteristics. Determinants of timely initiation of breastfeeding were assessed using univariate analysis and further evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis.Results: Of 362 mothers, 65.5% initiated breastfeeding within one hour of childbirth. Mothers belonging to Tharu ethnic groups (aOR 1.788; 95% CI: 1.014, 3.152), health facility delivery (aOR 3.381; 95% CI: 1.795, 6.369) and mothers who were counseled on breastfeeding during ANC attendance (aOR 2.898; 95% CI: 1.038, 8.096) were more likely to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of child birth. Conclusions: Almost two in every three mothers had initiated breastfeeding within one hour of childbirth. The factors influencing timely initiation of breastfeeding were Tharu ethnic mothers, health facility delivery and Ante Natal Care counseling.

Understanding the ecosystem dynamics (ED) from the perspective of both the drivers of changes and the effectiveness of policy−institution−program (PIP) responses is crucial for nature sustainability. PIP response to a management problem, as a sectoral intervention, has been analysed in the past; however, national-level assessment of drivers of ecosystem dynamics and its PIP responses has not been done so far. This paper is aimed at cyclical assessment and chronological analysis (1960–2020) of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the PIP responses to the drivers of ED, taking the case of Nepal. Using a driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework, we have assessed 38 drivers of ED on a decadal basis and analysed > 30 policy instruments as well as 15 periodic development plans (i.e., five-year plans and three-year plans) that have been developed yet. Moreover, we have carried out 300 household surveys to understand local people's demand for ecosystem management. Based on various qualitative and quantitative analyses, we have portrayed pressure, state, and impact of various economic, demographic, technological, governance, globalization, and other drivers, including PIP response to address the drivers of changes. We found that the drivers of ED are non-linear and multifaceted, but the PIP responses are sectoral and incremental (i.e., piecemeal gradation to the previous efforts). Instead of characterization of drivers of ED and public demand, domestic PIP responses are largely influenced by global environmental discourse. Our findings are critical in understanding dynamic drivers of ecosystems and pathways of PIP responses, which might support policymakers and scholars in Nepal and other developing countries in the Himalayas to recalibrate PIP measures for sustainable resource management by suitably addressing the drivers of ED.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0264837723002557,,SDG 15: Life on Land

One of the reasons could be the poor productivity. To improve the productivity of crops, it is essential that new site-specific, high-yielding and widely adopted varietal options for farmers should be developed for sustainability. To identify the varietal responses to environment, multi-location testing is one of the main tools. Following this, we evaluated agronomic performance of eight naked barley landraces collected from five different locations of Nepal with altitude ranging from 1370 to 2500 meter elevations from the sea level during the winter season of 2014/15 in order to assess the landraces adaptability across different locations. Combined analysis of variances revealed that NGRC02306, NGRC04902 and NGRC04894 were the high yielding landraces. The landrace namely NGRC04894 was found the most stable genotype with better adaptability to all tested environments whereas NGRC02306 and NGRC04902 were high yielding landraces adapted to high yielding environment namely Khumaltar. However, the lower yielding landrace NGRC02327 was the earliest and could be preferred by farmers as its maturity allows it to fit better in the rice based cropping system.

The author conducted detailed geological studies and mineral exploration in some of the copper and polymetallic prospects and also reviewed the literature related to copper prospects in Nepal. The present research is able to delineate two distinct copper ore mineralization belts extending from west to east and identify the promising sites for copper ore and polymetallic mineralization that could be feasible for mining. The northern mineralization belt lies close to the Main Central Thrust where the mineralization occurs mostly in metamorphic rocks of garnet amphibolite facies in Darchula,Bajhang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Solukhumbu and Ilam districts. The southern mineralization belt in the Lesser Himalaya occurs in low-grade metamorphic rocks of greenschist facies in Dadeldhura, Rukum, Baglung, Myagdi, Tanahun, Dhadhing, Makwanpur, Dolakha, Udaypur, Bhojpur and Ilam districts. Most of these prospects were locally exploited on a small scale by traditional mining before 1951. Almost all mineralization in both belts is related to hydrothermal dissemination, irregular multiple vein type, replacement and cavity fillings and only a few polymetallic mineralizations at the exo-contact zone of granite bodies. The ore minerals were concentrated during the processes of regional metamorphism at the time of Himalayan upheaval. In general, the copper content in the northern belt appears to be higher in grade and tonnage as compared to the southern belt. The frequent association of tungsten, molybdenum, bismuth, nickel, tin, lead, zinc ores and traces of gold suggests the urgent need for further detailed exploration and evaluation of selected prospects which could be economic deposits and feasible for mining.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57919/43295,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Canal lining determines the cost of project to a great extent but also the discharge delivery efficiency of the irrigation system. Though earthen canal sections are least expensive, simple to maintain and environmentally friendly, they have high seepage rates and demand frequent repair. In the light of need for resource conservation and the general unavailability of labour for maintenance work, a canal lining, though more expensive, may be justifiable in the long run. Technological advances in the construction have made available lighter and more affordable materials that enhance many parts of the irrigation process.It is the private sector that should lead the development of these technologies as they relate to the construction business. We can look to foreign markets to see how canal lining technologies have improved the use of this tool in various environments and soils. In the Nepali context, we use traditional lining techniques like stone or reinforced concrete, which are effective in the plains, but less so in the hills and remote. In this paper, I review some alternatives to traditional canal linings, and examine the virtues of high density polyethylene (HDP) pipe for possible use in irrigation schemes. HYDRO Nepal Journal of Water Energy and EnvironmentVolume- 18, 2016, JanuaryPage -25-29",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/14640/11867,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The result transcripts were analyzed in Atlasti version 7 and prioritized based on their frequency. The proper buying and selling mechanisms were not found in the current drinking water supply scheme in Sundarijal. The poor economic condition of users, inadequate funds in water users committee, and inadequate water collection for sales were determined as primary obstacles associated with PES establishment at the study site. Since the area has immense potential for PES, building additional water collection tanks with filter plants, a collaboration of multiple local organizations in the preparation of baseline document, identification of additional water sources, and adequate funding are perquisite to establish proper payment mechanism.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/forestry/article/download/41742/31731,,SDG 15: Life on Land

This article uses participatory research methods to document and analyse (1) local and regional impacts of climate change on ecosystem services (ES) and livelihoods, and (2) the main current adaptation strategies of local peoples in the mountains of central Nepal. Major observed impacts include reduced precipitation and an irregular rainfall pattern, affecting paddy cultivation and winter crop production. Production is also affected by increased pest and pathogen prevalence. Other impacts include increased livestock disease and reduced forest regeneration. Our results confirm earlier findings of a decrease in the district's forest cover in past; however, substantial efforts in forest conservation and management at the local level have gradually increased forest cover in recent years. Despite the increased potential for forest ecosystem services, the availability of forest goods, in particular fuel wood, fodder and litter, have decreased because of a strict regulation on forest goods extraction. Additionally, new invasive species are colonising these forests, preventing regeneration of preferred and local forest vegetation in some areas and, as a result, the densities of tree crops are changing. Most users cope with these changes by short term, reactive solutions. However, a number of local adaptation strategies, such as changing both agricultural practices and water harvesting and management, are increasing efficiency in resource use. To increase the adaptive capacity of poor households, we suggest it is essential to incorporate climate change adaptations within the local planning process.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/21513732.2015.1027793,,SDG 15: Life on Land

It is also commonly used as diagnostic test in the assessment or characterization of palpable breast mass along with ultrasonography. The purpose of our study was to assess the mammographic findings in women undergoing screening and diagnostic mammography. Methods: This was a prospective cross sectional study analyzing the outcomes of 497 consecutive screen-film mammographic examinations, 369 (74.2%) diagnostic and 128 (25.8%) screening, performed in female patients from 4th July 2012 to 15th October 2012 in Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital. Analysis was based on the final assessment report of mammogram reviewed by the experienced radiologists following Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification. BI-RADS score 4, 5 and 6 were considered as positive, BI-RADS score 1, 2 and 3 were considered as negative and BI-RADS score 0 was considered inconclusive requiring additional imaging. Results: The mean age of women was 46.3 years (range 26-83 years). Among 369 cases of diagnostic mammograms 300 (81.3%) were negative, 27 (5.4%) were positive and rest 42 (8.4%) were inconclusive. Among 128 cases of screening mammograms, 117 (91.4%) were negative, 11 (8.6%) were inconclusive and none of them were positive. Among total (497) numbers of mammographic examinations, 417 (84%) were negative, 27 (5.4%) were positive and 53 (10.6%) were inconclusive. BI-RADS 1 was the most common reported finding comprising 26.8% in diagnostic and 12.1% in screening group. Conclusion: Analysis of diagnostic mammography examinations yields different results compared with those of screening examinations, including different patient demographics; higher number of positive findings; and possibly higher cancer detection rates. Diagnostic and screening data should be segregated during record keeping and analysis of combined results should be based on known differences between diagnostic and screening outcomes.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/668/618,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Available data were collected from the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MoAD), Department of Agriculture (DoA) and Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC). Green house gas emission (GHG) was estimated by using IPCC 2006 guidelines. Agricultural activities contribute directly to emissions of greenhouse gases through a variety of processes including the source categories such as enteric fermentation in domestic livestock, livestock manure management, rice cultivation, and agricultural soil management. Diverse traditional agriculture systems, unique diversities in land types and unavailability of required disaggregated data at the national level as defined by the emission factor data base (EFDB) of the IPCC 2006, were the problem encountered while calculating the emission status in this study. Annual methane (CH4) emission from paddy fields ranged from 111.57 to 133.07 Gg over years 2000 to 2010 but it was found lowest ( 111.57 Gg) in the year 2002 and highest (133.07 Gg) in the year2003.

While Nepal has made significant advances in mitigating under-five mortality, much work is still needed to be done regarding the healthcare of infants. The Nepalese government has identified this as a problem and has introduced a series of interventions to improve the health outcomes of infants. The aim of this review is to identify the goals, interventions, and effectiveness of major infant mortality prevention programs around the country. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. The literature search revealed six programs that Nepal has utilized to combat infant mortality. The Community Based Management of Childhood Illness (CB-IMCI) program utilizes specially trained community workers to help identify and treat children with common childhood illnesses. The National Neonatal Health Strategy (NNHS) links families to the community and then to the broader healthcare system, with success found in its referral system. The Safe Delivery Incentives Program (SDIP) has found success with monetizing safe delivery practices, and shown an increase in safe deliveries with skilled healthcare workers present. Free Newborn Care (FNC) services were aimed at treating sick newborns for free, but ongoing concerns for program sustainability have led to further revision. The Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) is another plan aimed at preventing newborn deaths through improving health system administration and finances, but with limited efficacy data, it is hard to determine its success due to the lack of objective benchmark markers and data collected. Finally, the Birth Preparedness Package (BPP) is a highly efficacious program that encourages communities to plan for pregnancies by planning for delay barriers. Nepal has made significant strides in reducing infant mortality; however, much work still needs to be done. From 1990 to 2020, Nepal has reduced the under-five mortality rate from 138.8 deaths per 1,000 live births to 28.2 deaths per 1,000 live births.",https://www.cureus.com/articles/196847-infant-mortality-screening-and-prevention-initiatives-in-nepal,,SDG 15: Life on Land

This chapter examines whether women and men manage household waste differently at the household level, especially at source segregation, managing recyclable waste (paper and plastic), and composting degradable waste. Using household survey data from the Bharatpur Metropolitan City of Nepal, we find that women are more likely to segregate waste at the source and also manage degradable waste at home better. Still, there is no gender difference in selling plastic and paper waste. In contrast, women are more likely to give paper or plastic waste either to the waste collectors (free) or throw away, suggesting a heterogeneity across gender when it comes to managing household waste. In most cases, women waste managers perform well (segregating at source and composting degradable waste), but they do not seem to do well in all areas of plastic or paper waste management where some sort of sensitization may be helpful.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

However, around 80 percent of remittance received by households is used only for consumption purposes in Nepal. Despite the increasing importance of remittance in the Nepalese economy, the relationship between remittance and private consumption has not yet been adequately studied. Hence, the prime objective of this paper is to analyze the effects of remittance on private consumption expenditure in Nepal. The ARDL bounds testing model is employed in the study to identify the effects of remittance on private consumption in Nepal.

This study finds a positive and significant relationship between remittances and private consumption in Nepal. The impact of other control variables like GDP is positive and significant for consumption. However, the consumer price index has a negative effect on consumption.

Grounded in longitudinal data from the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey from 1996 to 2022, this study aims to shed light on evolving patterns in pregnancy outcomes and inequities in use of abortion services across ecological zones and wealth quintiles.Methods: Utilizing six rounds of Nepal Demographic and Health Survey data, pregnancy outcomes were categorized as abortion, delivery, miscarriage, or stillbirth. Income-related inequality in the utilization of abortion services was assessed through the concentration index, ranging from -1 to 1. Trends over time were evaluated using the annual rate of change.Results: The ARC indicated a substantial rise in induced abortion rates, surging from 0.4% in 1996 to 8.8% in 2022. In contrast, live births witnessed a decline from 92.8% to 81.2%. Significant variations were observed across ecological zones and wealth quintiles, with the Mountain zone and the Poorest group experiencing the most pronounced increases in induced abortion rates. By 2022, the concentration index reached a near-zero value, signifying a near-elimination of income-related disparities in the use of induced abortion services.Discussion: The findings suggest that while there has been significant progress in access to and use of abortion services in Nepal, particularly post-2002 policy shifts, challenges remain. Women from lower socio-economic backgrounds continue to face barriers, indicating the need for a multi-pronged approach to address residual challenges.Conclusions: Nepal has made remarkable strides in enhancing equitable access to and use of induced abortion services, but more needs to be done to guarantee equitable access for all women. Future efforts should focus on policy reforms, infrastructural improvements, and societal change to eliminate existing barriers to reproductive healthcare.Keywords: Abortion services; concentration Index; socio-economic disparities.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Because of rapid population growth and urbanization, land‐use and land‐cover (LULC) changes ultimately impact the services an ecosystem can offer. The LULC of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal have been altered due to urbanization, which is further expected to change in the future. However, a quantitative assessment of LULC impact on ecosystem services has not been undertaken. The purpose of this study is to assess the impacts affecting the ecosystem services values (ESV) in the Kathmandu Valley due to historical and projected LULC changes. We used satellite‐based datasets to assess LULC changes in the past, and Dyna‐CLUE to model future LULC changes. The benefit transfer approach was used to estimate ESV and their changes across time. Results confirmed the increase in urban area of 3.4% per year. This led to declining ESV from 1990 (US$ 231 million) to 2010 (US$ 205 million), which is predicted to decline further (US$ 157 million in 2050); on average US$ 12.3–13.2 million every decade u 1990 2050. This loss in ESV was dominated by the decline in agricultural land (40%, US$ 46.9 million), followed by deforestation (11%, US$ 11.1 million ). Development (like urbanization) often overlooks the values from ecosystem services (ES), but ES quantification serves as a tool to make appropriate decisions during those changes. As shown in this study, ESV can be effectively quantified via application of a parsimonious approach by utilizing globally available datasets. This is especially more important for the data scarce regions of developing countries that are undergoing rapid changes.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ldr.3837,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Using case studies of 6 remote villages nearest to known red panda habitats inside and outside a protected area in western Nepal, this study reports on key informant interviews, focus group discussions, informal interactions, and participant observations to identify and categorize the goods and services provided by these habitats. Among the provisioning and cultural ecosystem goods and services obtained from red panda habitats, local people prioritized seasonal grazing in high-altitude pastures, plant materials for medicines and food, wild plants for energy, transhumance culture, and religious interaction with nature. Their dependence on these services varied with season and location, with greater reliance on the services outside the protected areas. Some services used for valuing ecosystems, such as carbon storage and improved air and water quality and biodiversity, were only ever mentioned in a manner that would characterize them as cultural services provided by mountain deities. They only appear to be acknowledged as services with a use value by people from outside the region. This study suggests that understanding the value of the services provided to local communities could allow development of a policy that would also help conserve red pandas, particularly if income can be obtained for providing services to outsiders who have no perceived local economic benefit.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Here, to help reduce pressure on the panda, we quantified the current use of the most important ecosystem goods and services obtained in and around a protected area in western Nepal, trends over the last 20 years, and factors driving those trends. Our results show that more ecosystem goods and services were sourced by communities living outside the protected area than inside except for fodder and bedding for animals, recreational activities and ecotourism. Incomes inside the protected area were higher than outside. Of the seven main services investigated (i) use of medicinal plants had increased but their availability had declined; (ii) bamboo use remained steady but less was available; (iii) there were no perceived trends in firewood use or availability; (iv) there was less transhumant pastoralism to upland pastures but pasture availability had declined; (v) less fodder and bedding for animals was collected inside the park than outside, but the availability was unchanged; (vi) use of sacred religious sites had declined inside but not outside the park; (vii) the reverse was true for recreational tourism. Direct drivers of change in ecosystem service provision included changes in weather patterns and fluctuations in the market for goods; indirect drivers were institutional governance and regulation, population growth, literacy, poverty, and infrastructure development. Policies that ensure sustainable use of ecosystem goods and services from panda habitats could improve local livelihoods, reduce natural resource degradation and help conserve the panda.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/26395916.2022.2107079,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The objectives of the study were determining the better variety nitrogen management practices for spring rice cultivation. The study was conducted in Factorial Randomized Complete Block Design replicated thrice. Factor A includes spring rice varieties viz. Chaite-5 and Hardinath-3. Factor B includes the nitrogen management practices adopted which were: Recommended dose of N at 3 equal splits, 1/3 at basal +1/3 at 20 DAT + 1/3 at 45 DAT; Recommended dose of N at 3 splits, ¼ at basal + ½ at 20 DAT + ¼ at 45 DAT; N application using leaf color chart (LCC); Zero N, Control and Farmer’s Fertilizer Practices (FFP). Rice seedlings were raised in a wet nursery bed and transplanted in experimental plots on 21st March 2020. The crop geometry was 20 x 20 cm. Growth parameters, grain yield, and yield-attributing traits of rice were recorded. The results revealed statistical differences between the treatments in terms of agronomical parameters, yield attributing characters, and grain yield. Results indicate the recommended dose of N application at 3 splits i.e., ¼ at basal+ ½ at 20DAT+ ¼ at 45 DAT contributes to the higher plant height (104.79 cm), the number of tillers (9.88), grain yield (4.9 Mt ha-1) and straw yield (7.44 Mt ha-1). The highest LAI (2.84), flag leaf length (31.063 cm), and effective tillers/m2 (245.41) were obtained in nitrogen application using LCC. Moreover, the recommended dose of N at 3 splits, ¼ at basal + ½ at 20 DAT + ¼ at 45 DAT, and nitrogen application using LCC showed almost similar performance in most of the parameters. Among the varieties, Hardinath 3 produced the highest plant height (100.86 cm), Flag leaf length (29.509 cm), and 1000 grain weight (29.059 gm) as compared to Chaite 5 (94.613 cm), (26.355 cm) and (24.199 g) respectively.

Periodization of history in Nepal establishes a direct and necessary link between modern Nepal and its national territory. Indeed, the beginning of the modern era is determined by the “unification” of the fifty independent kingdoms and tribal territories that gave birth to the anational territory of Nepal during the second half of the 18th century. Such a correspondence makes modernity and the unified territory of Nepal coincide in a single space time. Yet, a closer examination of the logic behind periodization sheds light on its Kathmandu-centric, and dynastic perspective. This resulted in the formation of a hybrid conception of the national territory and of its center of power. From being the standard of the territory’s time and space, the Kathmandu Valley became the chronotope of the historical narrative dealing with the first half of the 19th century. It continued to form the territory’s remarkable center following the seizing of power by the Rana prime ministers (1846–1951), but now by assuming a futurist dimension, which conversely, plunged the rest of the country back in time.</p>",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The results of the on-site survey indicate that international visitors would be willing to pay entry fees that are much higher than those currently charged (local visitors are currently exempt from paying entry fees). Compared to the existing entry fees of 30 USD, visitors would – on average – be willing to pay about 64 USD per visit. An econometric estimation of the determinants of WTP shows that visitors whose experience in the park is above average are also willing to pay higher entry fees. In addition, visitors would also accept temporary or spatial restrictions of access if these policies would improve the conservation of biodiversity. With respect to conclusions regarding the management of protected areas, the study clearly shows that entry fees of international visitors may be significantly increased in order to broaden the financial basis for effective and efficient biodiversity conservation with the ultimate goal of sharing the benefits of conservation with the local population.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

However, health workers were only competent in 65% of skills. Although the majority were competent in communication skills and empathy, they were not competent in assessing physical and mental health, addressing confidentiality, involving family members in care, and assessing suicide risk. Higher competency was associated with lower stigma (social distance), but competency was not associated with knowledge.

Crustal thickening led to partial melting and formation of leucogranite melts along the top of the GHS, from earlier muscovite dehydration to later biotite dehydration melting with time. The granite was not a diapiric intrusion and does not intrude across the STD low-angle normal fault. A low-angle, north-dipping normal fault, the ductile-brittle Nar-Phu detachment wraps around the top of the Manaslu leucogranite and truncates all leucogranites in the footwall. The detachment formed the roof fault during exhumation of footwall rocks (channel flow) along the upper GHS during the early-middle Miocene. Metamorphism is also entirely regional and not contact metamorphism. U-Th/Pb monazite ages from metapelites show semi-continuous metamorphism across the GHS from ~35-15 Ma. The leucogranites were emplaced as layer-parallel sills entirely within the GHS between ~25-18.5 Ma. U-Th/Pb monazite dates from the Manaslu leucogranites suggest two major intrusion phases at 22.5 Ma (Larke-la phase) and 19.5 Ma (Bimtang phase). The sheeted sill complex was emplaced by progressive underplating with the oldest intrusions structurally above the younger ones. The migmatite melt source was likely buried further to the north. GHS rocks structurally beneath the Manaslu granite show few leucogranite dykes.

One third of GDP comes from agriculture and there are numerous opportunities in agriculture mainly because of varied agro-climate prevailed in the country. Niche specific commodities that have comparative advantage could be produced in fair quantity to meet the demand of huge market of neighboring India and China as purchasing capacity of people in those countries has improved markedly mainly for quality agriculture commodities. Trade deficit, food insecurity, income generation, poverty reduction, and employment generation could be addressed by turning present status of subsistence agriculture into robust, vibrant and commercial agriculture through technology led agro-industrialization. There are agro-commodities which are imported from India and other countries in huge quantity by the scarce hard currency earned through remittance. Evidence shows that almost 70% of the remittance is spent for agriculture commodities which have high potentiality to produce within the country even after local consumption. Such produce could be exported to other countries to mitigate trade imbalance, enhance export promotion and import reduction and promote graduating Nepal from LDC to DC within the stipulated time frame as proposed a couple of years ago by the government of Nepal. Nepal should come up with functional, pragmatic and implementable agriculture plan and policy to harness huge possibility of agriculture commercialization to meet the consumption demand per se within and outside the country. This paper highlights to address prospects and limitations of agriculture commercialization and suggests some way forward to make agriculture more vibrant and robust to address trade deficit, food and nutritional insecurity and livelihood enhancement of Nepalese as a whole thereby Nepal can tailor her pace of development with neighboring countries to meet the aspiration of Nepalese in the 21st century.Agronomy Journal of Nepal (Agron JN) vol. 4, 2016, Page: 38-63",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/15515/12519,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The study acquired studies from Web of Science and Google Scholar for systematic review. Altogether, 90 scientific studies, including 64 on land use and land cover and 26 on ecosystem services, published between 1986 and 2020 focusing Nepal, were assessed. The results show that there were continual changes in land-cover and land-use types in Nepal, as well as in the pace of development due to natural, anthropogenic, and policy factors. According to the national land-cover scenario, forests tended to increase, whereas agricultural land gradually decreased in recent years, with some of the available agricultural land even being abandoned. The scenario of the agricultural land in the Karnali river basin was different from those of the land in the Koshi and Gandaki basins. In the mid-twentieth century, the expansion of agricultural land and massive deforestation were observed, mainly in the Tarai region. Development works, urbanization, and the rural–urban migration led to the gradual decrease in and abandonment of the available agricultural land in recent decades. Further, this overall scenario has determined in provision of ESs. Forests have the highest value of ES, and community forests have played a vital role in their restoration. The concept of payment for ESs has greatly supported socio-economic development and ecosystem conservation.

This paper aims to analyze the constraints and opportunities of vegetable farmers in Kirtipur. Altogether 80 farm household survey were conducted in four major areas of Kirtipur. A total of 20 key informant interviews (KII) were also conducted to understand the perception of farm households on commercial vegetable farming. The result shows that around 94% of the total sampled farm households have leasehold farmland that has spread to different settlements of Kirtipur Municipality. Out of total leasehold farmers, 69% have written agreement with the landowner. The result also shows that the farmers cultivate vegetables in an average area of 5.67 ropani (2884.49m2). Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) are the primary vegetable products, whereas cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) and other green leafy vegetables are mostly cultivated as secondary vegetable products. Dug wells are the major sources of irrigation on vegetable farmland. Out of the total sampled farm households, about 42% of farmers are associated with farmers group and 37% have basic training on vegetable farming. Majority of farmers have savings from vegetable production and marketing. Despite few constraints like price fluctuation (81%) and high middleman margins (71%), vegetable farming in Kirtipur has many opportunities particularly being a major source income and livelihood (93%), self-employment generation (87%) and growing market demand (83%).

Firstly, people displaced due to conflict, primarily Maoist insurgency.

The second and largest group of internally displaced persons are the collateral victims of the armed conflict, primarily poor villagers who have fled their home land due to general insecurity, degradation of the local economy and services, food scarcity, fear of abduction by the Maoists, or fear of harassment and violence by either the Maoists or the government's security forces (including the national police, Armed Police Force and Nepalese Army). This group includes a wide range of rural castes and ethnicities. The internal displacement of villagers has not been chaotic and random, however. These IDPs have generally followed routes already established by rural-to-urban labour migration, settling in destinations and finding employment with the assistance of already-migrated family and community members. The third groups of IDPs due to the armed conflict are youth, primarily boys and young men above the age of 12.

The Tamakoshi basin is a trans-boundary river that originates from Tibet and flows through Dolakha and Ramechap districts before joining the Sapta Koshi river. Few studies exist in Nepal attempting to quantify the erosion rate and susceptibility. However, they are scattered and mainly focus on either rill-sheet erosion or landslide only. Hence, this study attempted to estimate slope erosion by applying the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), and soil and debris erosion from landslide (2000-2019). Spatially distributed erosion intensity maps derived from the RUSLE model, as well as index-based landslide susceptibility map, were integrated to capture both running water and gravity erosion processes. The novelty of this research is that it examined the soil erosion rate using a process-based model as well as from the soil or rock displaced by the observed landslides over the last 20 years. The study estimated gross annual erosion by running water of 9.1million tons/yr, equivalent to the denudation rate of 3.34 mm/yr. Of these, landslide erosion accounts for 7.6 million ton/yr, i.e., 2.88 mm/yr, this covers about 84% of total slope erosion.

It has a high prevalence in the population and is associated with high morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Here, we aimed to study the socio-demographic profiles, etiologies of CKD and associated co-morbidities in patients attending a referral hospital. Methods: We conducted a hospital based, descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study among adult patients with CKD attending Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH), Kathmandu. Patients younger than 16 years and renal allograft recipients were excluded from the study. A diagnosis of CKD was established by the treating nephrologist based on KDIGO 2012 clinical practice guideline. Prior informed consent was taken. Data was collected on clinical features, socio-demographic profiles, major co-morbidities, presumed etiology of CKD and hematological and biochemical parameters of the patients. SPSS version 24 (Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the analysis of data. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Institute of Medicine (IOM). Results: A total of 401 patients with CKD were included in the study. The mean age of the patient was 50.92 years (SD=17.98), male to female ratio was 1.8:1. Among these patients, 86% were Hindu, 24.4% were farmers, 57% were from the Hilly region of Nepal, 51% were active smokers, and 51.6% were alcohol consumers. Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) (36.2%; n= 145), diabetes mellitus (31.9%; n= 128) and hypertension (21.7%; n=87) were the three most common identified causes of CKD. Among the biopsy proven CGN patients, IgA nephropathy was the most common cause. In a large proportion of patients (68.3%) cause of CGN was not known. Most of the patients were in CKD stage 5 (27%), and stage 5D (55.8%). Coronary artery disease (CAD) (in 7% patients), heart failure (in 2.7%) and stroke (in 2.2%) were the most common comorbidities. Anemia was prevalent in CKD from stage 3 onwards, the severity increased with increasing stage (p <0.001). Hemodialysis was the predominant mode of renal replacement therapy (RRT) used by 98.2% of CKD 5D patients. Conclusion: Nepalese patients of CKD are younger; males are more affected than females.

Similarly, there are different causes of trade disputes between china and the U.S.A.. Its comparative advantage is that it can produce goods for lower costs than other countries. So, recent days, American companies cannot compete with low costs of China. Another reason is the view of President Donald J Trump like 'the trade wars good and easy to win'.

Similarly, it affects both economies of China and the U.S.A. and also promotes regional trade and dumping policy. Accordingly, exports base of Nepal is weak and its exports to China are being affected due to trade wars, despite the fact that trade to the United States does not affect.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/35948/28103,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Nested quadrats of 10m×10m, 5m×5m, and 1m×1m were used to collect the data from tree, sapling, and seedling, respectively. Dispersion indices: variance to mean ratio (I), index of Morisita (Iä), coefficient of Green (Cx), and the k exponent of negative binomial distribution were used to identify the distribution pattern of the species. Test of significance of I, and Iäprovided the information on rejection of null hypothesis: C. tamala does not follow the random distribution. The K exponent of negative binomial distribution suggests moderate contiguous pattern, which is in line with the previous studies of vegetation elsewhere.

The government has been spending a significant portion of its budget on imports, and it aims to reduce this dependence by increasing domestic production and achieving food security goals. To understand the dynamics of this issue, system dynamics modelling steps were employed. The key variables considered in the model testing were domestic production, imports, per capita consumption, productivity per hectare, and average area expansion rate. The study utilized time series data from 1991 to 2020 and projected the analysis up to 2050 using Stella Architect, a computer-based software program. The findings reveal that both the population and imports have exhibited exponential growth over the years. The model also indicates goal-seeking behaviour, with the government setting targets for yield increment based on available harvest areas. However, the policies implemented thus far have mostly been quick-fix approaches focusing input subsidized programs. According to the model, an increase of 70-100% in rice production will be required by 2050 to meet the growing population's demand. The study presents three policy options for achieving rice self-sufficiency: 1) a 2% annual increase in average area expansion, 2) raising productivity from 3700 kg ha-1 to 5000 kg ha-1 and 3) increasing productivity to 3900 kg ha-1 while reducing per capita rice consumption from 200 kg to 130 kg. The study suggests that adopting the recommended policy implications can help increase rice production in Nepal. Decision-makers should adopt a dynamic approach to the rice production system to address the issue of slow growth and achieve national self-sufficiency and food security goals.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/62168/46954,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Data from in-depth stakeholder interviews (n = 16), household perception surveys (n = 440), and participant observations (n = 5) were supplemented by meteorological and land use cover change data. Descriptive analysis, index value calculation, Spearman’s Rho correlation, and chi-square statistics were used to understand linkages between socio-demographics, climate change perceptions, watershed ecosystem services importance, and changes in watershed ecosystem services supply. The Mann–Kendall test, Sen’s slope calculation, and land use cover change analysis considered temperature, precipitation, and land use. Among watershed ecosystem services, communities prioritized drinking water as the most important and biodiversity support as the least important. Watershed ecosystem services exhibited decreasing trends, with soil fertility and productivity notably high (89%) and natural hazard control low (41%). Significant alignment existed between community perceptions and local climate indicators, unlike the incongruity found with land use cover changes, especially regarding water bodies. Socio-demographic factors influenced community perceptions. Policy recommendations include analyzing watershed-level community demand and preferences, integrating community perceptions with climate change and land use cover change data in decision making, engaging communities, equitable sharing of the benefits generated by watershed ecosystem services, and considering socio-demographic and topographic diversity in tailoring management strategies.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/1/62/pdf,,SDG 15: Life on Land

They frequently encounter with wildlife and get injured; sometimes they are killed. Similarly, wildlife cross the park boundary and destroy the crops and kill the livestock. Villagers also get their shelters and sheds damaged by them. BNP, therefore, has introduced various programmes to keep the conservation intact without disturbing the livelihood of Buffer Zone people. Several efforts, such as construction of Trench, Machan etc. have been made to address the issues associated with park people conflicts.

Using data from the third wave of the Household Risk and Vulnerability Survey 2018, logistic regression is employed to analyze both the likelihood of LPG adoption and household expenditure on LPG under conditions of natural shocks. The findings reveal that households experiencing natural shocks are 5 percent less on average likely to adopt biogas or LPG. Furthermore, household expenditure on LPG decreases by 4.43 percent relative to cooking fuel expenses particularly for firewood by the households experiencing natural shocks. This reduction highlights a decline in the intensity of clean energy use among households concurrently using LPG and firewood.

Likewise, Dalits and Muslims have higher vulnerability scores compared to other castes / ethnic groups. The estimation suggests that the poverty incidence and vulnerability scores largely overlap, yet the vulnerability scores are consistently higher among all groups indicating a high risk of households falling into poverty.

It is now commonly used to describe all aspects of forensic caseworks; including forensic pathology, that branch of forensic medicine which investigates death, and clinical forensic medicine, which involves interaction between the law, judiciary and the police involving (generally) living persons. The medico legal investigation system in our country still lags far behind the developed countries. The doctors doing the medico legal and post-mortem work at the district level hospitals are often untrained in this sensitive job. It is a job of great responsibility and to leave it to inexperienced doctors is actually doing injustice to the society. Forensic experts handle a very small part of total medico-legal work as most of them work in private medical colleges which are not permitted to handle the work. Mortuaries are housed in outdated facilities. Exposure to the medical students on medico legal cases including autopsy is done only on a sporadic basis taking them to nearby government hospitals and even if they visit the hospitals, inadequate infrastructure prevents better learning. Private medical colleges are conducting postgraduate course in forensic medicine without handling medico legal cases. There should be a post of forensic medicine specialist, at least at the zonal hospitals and the district hospitals handling more medico legal cases. The private medical colleges, especially those enrolling postgraduate students in the field, must seek permission to conduct medico legal works and the government also should not be reluctant in permitting so as it’s not producing adequate experts in itself as per the need of the country.

It may include the use of threat or force. In some cases, the person cannot give consent to sex because he/she is unconscious or otherwise incapacitated. A person may be raped by a stranger, an acquaintance or date or a family member.Methods: The study was a retrospective and descriptive analysis of cases of sexual assault victims examined by the author in the Forensic Medicine departments at Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj and Gandaki Medical College Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal over a period of four years (2012 to 2016). This includes information regarding the age group of the victim at the time of sexual abuse, relationship of the victim to the perpetrator, genital and extra-genital injuries present over the victim’s body and number of cases attended as an expert witness by the author in various courts of Nepal.Results: In the four years period, a total number of 55 cases were examined as sexual assault cases. It was observed that majority were of the 13 - 15 years of age group (46%) followed by <10 years (20%), 16 - 20 years (16%), >20 years (11%) and 10 - 12 years (7%). Regarding the relationship of the victim to the alleged perpetrator, 87% cases (48 out of 55) were related to acquaintances compared to 13% due to strangers. Surprisingly, 3.6% cases (2 out of 48) were due to the biological fathers of the victims. On physical examination of the victim’s body, 36% cases showed genital injuries compared to only 15% with extra genital injuries. The author attended the court as an expert witness in 33% of these cases. Only 7% of the cases were mentally challenged.Conclusion: Young adults remain the most vulnerable group, so education related to sex, morality, humanity and different life skills training should be provided to these groups from their school years itself. The benefits of early intervention and comprehensive care of survivors with the use of standardized protocols along with shorter and lesser traumatic period of court processing to the survivors of these cases should be encouraged.Journal of Gandaki Medical College Volume, 09, Number 2, July December  2016, Page: 43-46",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/17865/14496,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Lockdown is considered to be an effective measure in slowing the spread of coronavirus. The study expects to understand community and healthcare providers’ perspectives on COVID-19 and pandemic responses during and after the lockdown in Nepal. Methods and material: Data were collected through telephone interviews with six representatives of community-based organizations and nine healthcare providers, and the collation of information about COVID-19 from social media, news outlets and government announcements. Data were thematically coded and analyzed according to the themes. Results: Although rapid dissemination of educational information through various social media was found, people reported an information overload on COVID-19 while questioning the authenticity of their sources. Several misbeliefs on the COVID-19 virus are rooted in the Nepalese community. Lockdown for a longer period was deemed an unsustainable preventive measure that directly impacted the income source of daily-wage workers. The fear of contracting coronavirus among healthcare providers at their workplaces was further triggered by the poor working conditions and non-availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). In fighting the pandemic, screening and management of other health issues were ignored. Conclusion: The prevention measures against COVID-19 are important for the local context, however, the communities need access of basic commodities and access to reliable information to enable them to follow these measures. Availability of appropriate PPE for the healthcare providers is required to reduce the fear of contracting the virus from the patients and workplace.

They play a vital role in daily life purposes to big engineering constructions such as dams, reservoirs or hydropower projects. It is mandatory to understand the morphology and dynamics of the river before initiating any projects for easier planning and to prevent possible damage to structures. The Malekhu Khola area is one of the potential areas for urbanization and has already been undergoing development of settlement and other infrastructures. This paper describes the morphology and dynamics of the Malekhu Khola to classify and characterize the river's behavior and competency. The Malekhu Khola is a sixth-order river having its total length of 24.83 km, watershed area of 101.28 km2 and the average gradient of 0.041 m/m. Various morphological parameters were measured with the aid of topographic maps, aerial photographs and Geographic Information System (GIS). The hydraulic parameters, channel sediment and slopes were measured at 10 different transects sites through field surveys. The river was classified using the Rosgen's Level II criteria. The river reaches have been classified as A4-, B4- and C4-type streams. A4- and B4-type streams are moderate-gradient gravelly and low sinuosity rivers whereas C4-type streams are low-gradient gravelly meandering river. The Malekhu Khola gradually changes from A4- to B4-type streams up to 12 km downstream, and then to C4-type stream further downstream, but B4-type streams reappear within the distance of 15 km to 19 km from the origin. This study presents temporal changes in river channel, and flow competence and aggrading/degrading potential evaluation of the Malekhu Khola.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/22873/19438,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Although minimum wages remains an utmost prority as a redistributive tool, studies shows that its fixation are mostly driven by political interest of the incumbent government and the interest of the private sector. Nepal is not an exception to this. This paper attempts to propose a need based method of setting minimum wages for Nepal. In addition to the food and non-food information, unlike previous need based approaches, this study uses housing information from the nationally representative household survey to derive the minimum wages for Nepal.

Attitude can be formed from a person’s past and present. This profession continues to grow and the attitude of the society toward it has been changing gradually. There have been a few studies on the attitude of the nurses toward their own profession in Nepal. The primary objective of this study is to compare the attitude of the nursing students and the practicing nurses toward nursing profession. Methods: A quantitative, prospective comparative cross sectional study design was adapted for this study. Nursing students studying proficiency certificate level (PCL)in a Nursing campus, and the practicing nurses working at a Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) in Kathmandu, Nepal were selected as study population. Attitude scale for nursing profession (ASNP) developed by Ipek- Coban and Kasikci in 2011 was adapted for the purpose of this study. Results: A total of 240 participants were selected for the study. One hundred and twenty were nursing students and 120 were practicing nurses.

The household survey was carried out in Kailash (hill) and Nayabasti (terai) of Chitwan. Descriptive analysis, mean comparison, correlations, and biodiversity indices were used for data analysis. On the basis of biodiversity index, evenness, the adequate number of species, and Sorenson’s coefficient, open-pollinated (OP) (nonhybrid) vegetables were more diverse in hills than in terai, while hybrid vegetables are more diverse in terai than in hills. Hybrid vegetables were mostly grown in terai, where the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides was also higher. OP vegetables dominated hilly areas. Gurung ethnic community had a significant role in the conservation of indigenous vegetable biodiversity. The primary source of seed was home storage in the case of OP vegetables in hills. However, in terai, agro-concerns were used as a significant source of seeds, followed by co-operatives. Co-operatives’ involvement was high in terai as compared to hills, but the role was not significant in vegetable farming. In contrast, assistance in vegetable farming from agriculture service provider organizations was higher in hills as compared to terai. The major problem in vegetable farming was lack of irrigation in both areas, followed by market inaccessibility in hills, whereas climate change was rising as a problem in terai. Markets of produced goods were farm gate, local markets, and distant markets. A middleman mostly did the price determination of the products. Off-season vegetable farming was not practiced in the study areas. However, off-farm vegetable production was typical in hilly areas. Indigenous and OP vegetable biodiversity has been facing various challenges despite their roles in nutrition, indigenous knowledge promotion, and food security. Hence, it is suggested to strengthen government policy toward irrigation facility development, gene bank establishment, marketing facilities, and technology transfer and develop on-farm community based intense organizations for sustainable vegetable diversity conservation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/29731/23899,,SDG 15: Life on Land

A total of 140 papers were obtained from these publications, of which 46 papers (33%) directly focused on forest ES in Nepal. However, the publication trends have increased only in recent years, and the distribution is non-homogenous and clustered around the central and western regions. Many studies (62%) dealt with regulating services, especially estimating carbon stock. We have listed eight major implications of this synthesis while discussing the likely effects of climate change on forest ES in Nepal. Payment for ecosystem services (PES), a global policy design, appears to be a better option to tackle climatic impacts on forest ES through adaptation measures in Nepal, in addition to more collaborative research involving universities and research organizations and expanding in spatial scale and coverage of all ecosystem service categories.",https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/cfa/ifr/2018/00000020/00000004/art00007,,SDG 15: Life on Land

As a result of increased productivity of the forest and restoration of degraded areas, forest users have been able to receive various economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits to strengthen their livelihood. Despite many positive outcomes of community forestry, there are still some factors which haven’t allowed the proper biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services maintenance. The study carried out on 100 operational plans from different parts of the country and it showed that the incorporation status of biodiversity and ecosystem services into community forest operational plan is worse despite the fact that such plan is the main component to lead the destination of any community forest. In addition to this, some gaps and challenges were observed in community forestry which have not favoured to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services management systematically at an optimum level. Among them, duplication problem of biodiversity and ecosystem services related issues in operational plan; timber oriented operational plan; limited provision about wildlife conservation and negative perception of people on wildlife and their conservation owing to human wildlife conflict; dominant socioeconomic factors; impact of introduced species, invasive and alien species; lacking in provision of adaptation and mitigation methods to cope with impact of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services and shrinking of biological corridor due to habitat fragmentation were major issues. Besides this, to address these issues, it was also identified from the national consultation workshop of forest officials and experts that most appropriate uniform methods, measures and mechanisms are needed to be developed for the complete assessment, prioritization, analysis and development of action plans to main stream biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services management into operational plan of community forestry.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/BANKO/article/download/25149/21114,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Considering the need to reduce landslide risks, this research determined the spatial extent of landslide hazard degrees in the Panchase area. The research site, with an area of 278.324 km2, consists of parts of the Kaski, Parbat, and Syangja Districts. A Statistical Index Method was used for hazard analysis that produced weights. Positive weight values for each factor class represented a higher hazard and vice versa. An inventory of the study area identified 556 landslides measuring 1.511 km2 indicating a landslide density of 2 per km2 area. Thirteen percent (36.18 km2) of the total experimental area was rated as a very high hazard zone. Similarly, the area occupied by high hazard and moderate hazard zones were 77.66 km2 (28%), and 81.83 km2 (29%) respectively. The validation showed that the method can produce results with of accuracy of 82.8%. This indicated the hazard assessment process is acceptable and replicable. The factor classes having greater influence for higher landslide hazard are: near the streams, near the roads, barren or grassland, land with phyllite bedrocks, land receiving rainfalls greater than 4,000 mm, lands with an elevation range from 1,000 m to 1,500 m, slopes steeper than 30°, and south-facing slope.

Bringing the time series trade data from reliable sources, this study also attempts to highlight import dependency ratio, correlation of population and GDP per capita growth with total import and pin down plausible reasons behind these pictures. The correlation study between import data to population growth and GDP per capita showed a positive correlation with r values 0.71 (p<0.05) and 0.99 (p<0.05), respectively. National supply sides when combine with domestic production mimics aggregate rice demands and these figures show increasing patterns accompanied by growing imports together with import dependency ratio. India alone dominates the rice trade which accounts for more than 90 percent of Nepal’s import in recent years. These noticeable surges in rice imports can be attributed to liberal trade policies of the respective trade partner countries, improvement in incomes, closer proximity, similar languages, and consumer preferences among others. Opening a domestic market for rice cannot be denied theoretically in favor of welfare-improving policy tools, however, it should be carefully considered to protect local farmer’s concerns. Though growth in rice productivity is encouraging over the recent previous years, there is ample potential to increase further by integrated programs combining expansion of spring paddy, inputs, irrigation, and technology. Moreover, attention should be paid toward consumer’s fine rice preferences aligning farmer’s motivations. The introduction of fiscal policy with application of tariff or non-tariff measures at least for a few years can encourage the domestic rice industry. Above policy adjustment can drive Nepal toward its rice self-reliant footing.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44796/33691,,SDG 15: Life on Land

However, mainstreaming climate change issues into sectoral policies from the government can be seen as recent activities in Nepal. Nepal has contributed negligible amount of emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) of global greenhouse gas, it is the fourth most vulnerable country in the world. In this context, this paper aims to review climate change adaptation policies in terms of sectoral integration. This paper has adopted text-mining method for information retrieval and knowledge mining and followed step-by-step approach to undertake review of policies. It concludes that National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010 can be a milestone in sectoral adaptation of climate change issue largely because it has provided the national framework for sectoral adaptation to climate change. However, NAPA ignores the importance of structural and institutional reforms needed for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into sectoral agencies. Climate change Policy, 2011, Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) 2011, Constitution of Nepal, 2015, Local Government Operation Act (LGOA) 2017, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017 and National REDD+ Strategy, 2018 are other prominent legislative and policy frameworks that have significant contribution in sectoral integration of climate change adaptation issues. However, lack of climate change act in order to implement fully these policies into practice for its implementation can be a major obstacle to achieve the goal.

This paper concludes that newly endorsed Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act (2017) can be a milestone in disaster management of Nepal not only because it has replaced about 40 years old Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 but also for the first time, it saw disaster risk management as an process focusing on different stages of disaster management cycles, preparedness, response and rehabilitation and mitigation. The provision of well-structured functional institutional set-up from the centre to local level can have positive outcome in disaster management. However, it overlooks significant aspect, such as the declaration of disaster-prone zones limiting the right of provincial disaster management committee only for recommendation to the Government of Nepal. Most of policies, strategies and legislations focused on some specific disasters such as flood, landslide, earthquake and GLOF/avalanches at national level paying less emphasis to the local level. Even now, most of the policy interventions towards different cycles of disaster risk management have laid emphasis on preparedness and response rather than to rehabilitation and mitigation. The conflicting provisions in Acts such as Water Resource Act (1992) and Building Act (1998) with Local Government Operation Act (2017) have made overlapping of their roles and responsibilities. So, the policy formulation and institutional set-up needs to be complemented by the ability and competence to operationalize the intent of the relevant acts and policies at all levels of government.The Geographical Journal of NepalVol. 11: 1-24, 2018 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/19546/16004,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Despite recognition of adaption in response to multiple changes in sustainable livelihood and critical climate change literature, risks attributed to biophysical effects of climate change have increasingly assumed importance. Consequently, diversification is promoted as an adaptive approach to reduce such risks. However, understanding livelihood adaptation from the vantage point of climate change alone might lead to a limited understanding of non-climatic factors also shaping it. This paper proposes understanding adaptation through analysing long-term livelihood changes and using society rather than climate change as a conceptual starting point. It argues that such an approach has better potential to highlight a broader range of dynamic drivers operating over decades and to inform contextually grounded rural livelihood adaptation policies. Changes are traced in the overall livelihood trajectories among four rural communities in Nepal, in living memory, to understand the role of adaptation in shaping it. Qualitative life narratives were collected and complemented by key informant interviews, field observations and the analysis of official documents. The findings suggest that livelihoods have shifted not only from subsistence towards income generation but also from engagement in diverse livelihood sectors towards specialisation; the opposite of the advocated diversification. The role of political, economic, social and cultural processes within and outside the community has been prominent in shaping this trajectory.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23416/19845,,SDG 15: Life on Land

So, the paper tries to address the key research questions about the factors influencing crop diversity on the farm and are the household with high farm diversity more food secure or not? The study thus aimed to assess the on-farm crop diversity and their relation to food self-sufficiency in two different agro-ecological regions of Nepal, i.e. Tulsipur sub-metropolitan (inner terai) and Sundarbazar municipality (mid-hill). For this, a total of 70 households were randomly selected, 35 from each region, and semi-structured interviews, direct observation, and focus group discussion were employed to collect primary data. And the richness, Shannon–wiener, Simpson index, and food self-sufficiency level of households were assessed. The Shannon Wiener index of vegetables, spices were found to be 3.770 and 3.721 and that of fruits was found 2.772 and 2.607 in the home garden of Tulsipur and Sundarbazar respectively. Food self-sufficiency was achieved among 40% of households in the Tulsipur while the figure of the Sundarbazar was only 28.6%. The size of cultivated area and species richness was found moderately positive correlated. Statistical analysis showed that agro-biodiversity across two regions had less difference and finally, the paper showed that biodiversity level has a direct link to household food self-sufficiency level which helps in reducing food insecurity. Our results, therefore, promote to make effective implementation of regional food security strategies and policies to improve.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

In Nepal, the southern part of the country comprises Quaternary deposits called as Indo-Gangetic deposit. Sand and silts are dominant in this zone, where groundwater level is also relatively high. In eastern Nepal, several places have experienced ground fissures, sand boiling, and liquefaction during the large earthquakes in the past history. There are several factors including soil properties, groundwater level, grain size of sediments and ground acceleration that contribute to ground liquefaction. The eastern Nepal faced a devastating earthquake in 1934 (magnitude of 8.4), Udaypur earthquake in 1988 (magnitude of 6.6) and Sikkim-Nepal earthquake in 2011 (magnitude of 6.8) and there is still possibility of similar large earthquakes in future. Liquefaction was reported in many places during Nepal-Bihar earthquake that indicates possibility of liquefaction during similar earthquakes. Liquefaction potential values are calculated from sediment grain size, subsurface geology, groundwater level and standard penetration test (SPT)-N values. The epicenter, magnitude, and other parameters of Nepal-Bihar earthquake have been used to calculate the liquefaction potential. A liquefaction susceptibility map has been prepared in the study area that comprises low, medium, and high liquefaction potential zones.

The catchment lies in the Siwalik Hills composing the Siwalik Group of rocks of Middle Miocene to Early Pleistocene age. Owing to the week and fragile geology, the Siwalik Hills are prone to the gully erosion, shallow landslide and debris flow, during the heavy rain storms in monsoon seasons. In the present study, landslide susceptibility assessment was carried out using two methods, rapid field-based assessment and statistical index methods. For the susceptibility mapping of the river bank slopes, field- based method was used. The seven parameters such as slope angle, slope material, reduction to groundwater, effect of drainage, effect of past failure, effect of vegetation cover and effect of land use were used to calculate the factor of safety in the field. The slope areas were classified as highly susceptible (FS<0.7), susceptible (0.7<FS<1), marginally stable (1<FS<1.2) and stable (FS>1.2) categories, and finally, a susceptibility map was prepared. For the total 4.179 sq. km area where rapid field-based assessment was carried out, the areas covered by highly susceptible, susceptible, marginally stable and stable zones are respectively, 21.56%, 22.11%, 17.37% and 38.95%. Among the highly susceptible and susceptible zones identified, 71% sites have experienced recent slope failures.

The construction industry for Roads and Bridges in Nepal is in a transitional phase and the working procedures varies on the individual capacity of each contractor. So, a practical approach is necessary for developing a methodology for estimation of duration. At present the estimated contract duration lacks uniformity among the projects of similar size and nature. With time extension issue getting much attention in recent amendments of PPR, estimation of duration has yet in the shadows among the lawmakers. This research aims at developing an empirical formulae for determination of contract duration based on the historical data of roads and bridges completed within the last five years. A total of 83 bridges and 78 road projects were analyzed. Regression analysis was carried out for developing a mathematical relation between time and cost of the project. The data was made to fit in Browmillow’s time-cost model. Apart from the cost of the project, there are other factors that affect the duration of the project. To address these project specific requirements, modification were recommended to the time-cost model by introducing coefficients in the empirical relation. As per the obtained equation, contract duration is directly proportional to the cost. However, the rate of increase in contract duration decreases with increase in cost. The reason for this is due to the higher level of parallel activities and better use of technologies for the contracts with higher cost. This model can be useful for government agencies, contractors and consultants involved in construction and procurement of roads and bridges in Nepal. The empirical formula obtained as an outcome of this research is applicable for roads and bridge projects of Nepal with estimated amount greater than two crore.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/njce/article/download/43372/32856,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The findings reveal that while PPPs have the potential to attract private investment, enhance efficiency, and promote economic growth, they face several obstacles. Key challenges include an underdeveloped legal and regulatory framework, limited government capacity, and issues related to accountability and transparency. The necessity for a clear regulatory framework is paramount, as it would provide the guidelines needed for effective collaboration between public entities and private investors. Moreover, enhancing institutional capacity and establishing robust accountability mechanisms are crucial for strengthening the PPP model in Nepal. By addressing these systemic challenges, Nepal can better leverage PPPs to improve its infrastructure, stimulate economic development, and enhance public service delivery.

Many hill villages are situated on or adjacent to unstable slopes and old landslides are reactivated from time to time. The rapidly increasing construction of infrastructure, such as roads, irrigation canals, and dams without due consideration of natural hazards is contributing to triggering of landslides and debris flows. Thus, this paper has explored the cause and characteristics of landslides occurrences and their mitigation practices in Nepal. Topographic, geologic and triggering factors, and human intervention causing landslides are characterised to suggest the suitable mitigation options that can be implemented in the mountain hill-slopes. Among the wide range of slope stabilisation measures which are available to practitioner engineer, the lowering of groundwater level in combination of controlling of surface infiltration (e.g. sealing of tension cracks) of water into landslide are the most cost effective options for mountainous terrain because the rise in pore water pressure is one of the basic cause of landslides during the rainy season.

The objective of the study is to find the burden of thyroid disorder in a district hospital of Nepal.Methods: This was a descriptive cross sectional study conducted in Bayalpata Hospital. One year data from July 2017 to June 2018 was collected from the electronic health record system. Data was collected from 999 patients through convenient sampling where thyroid function test was done. Subgroup analysis was done on basis of gender, symptoms at presentation and comorbidities.Results: Prevalence of thyroid disorder in a district hospital of Nepal was 171 (17.11%) at 95% confidence interval, range occurring from 14% to 20%. Among them, 130 (76%) had hypothyroidism and 41 (24%) had hyperthyroidism. Prevalence of thyroid disorder among female was 147 (14.7%) and among male was 24 (2.4%). The most common symptom was depressed mood followed by nonspecific pain disorder, thyroid swelling, paresthesia and menstrual disturbances and common comorbidities reported were depression, diabetes, hypertension, anxiety disorder and chronic gastritis. Conclusions: Our study showed the burden of thyroid disorders in a primary care district hospital with hypothyroidism being more common than hyperthyroidism. Thyroid disorder must be addressed on time to lower the burden. However, most of the rural population of Nepal lack in matters of lack of resources.

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal among 340 neonates suspected of neonatal sepsis. Blood culture was performed and organisms were identified with Gram staining and conventional biochemical methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Results: The prevalence rate of neonatal sepsis was 20.3%. Among 340 neonates, 52.17% were males and 47.82% were females. Gram positive cocci were the most predominant isolates (88.40%). Among Gram positive cocci Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common isolates (72.46%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (7.24%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.34%) and Enterococcus fecalis (4.34%). Gram negative bacilli were found in 11.60% of the growth positive samples of which E.coli and Klebsiella spp were found in 10.14% and 1.44% respectively. Sensitivity to Amikacin was highest among all types of organisms isolated. Vancomycin and Gentamycin sensitivity was highest for Gram positive and Gram negative organisms respectively. Ampicillin resistance was highest among isolates. Among the 69 isolates 48 were Multiple drug resistant. Conclusion: The predominance of Gram positive cocci particularly Coagulase negative Staphylococci is shown. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be reviewed for Multiple drug resistant strains.

However, some spurious expert and vested interest group exaggerated the hydro potentiality and distorted the fact of water resources development prospective in Nepal. This has created confusion among the policymakers, politician and multilateral agencies. As a result, hydropower development in Nepal has headed for wrong course, and now the power sector, the vital impetus for socio-economic development is in dire strait. This paper highlights the uniqueness and distinct technical features of Nepalese Power Sector. In this paper important component like Integrated National Power System/Grid (INPS), Power Generation Modality (Hydropower, Thermal/Nuclear Plants and Diesel Plants) are well described and Master Plan, Project Selection, Construction Schedules and Hydropower potentiality of Nepal are discussed in detail. In a severe power and energy crisis situation in the country, power export is not recommended. Nepal needs 3000 MW to reach the level of other south Asian nations. INPS is owned and operated by NEA; therefore NEA also has the responsibility to prepare master plan for power generation, transmission and distribution. But, the Department Electricity Development a regulatory body of Ministry of Energy of is undertaking / carrying out feasibility study without taking care of INPS/country’s power requirement. This has created duplication of work and confusion; as such the Ministry of Energy deviated from its responsibility of preparing sound policy, regulation and monitoring them strictly.

Remittances are considered to be the most significant source of foreign currency that makes strong position of balance of payments, whereas the volume of imports is one of the most significant elements that lowers the volume of foreign currency reserve of the nation. It is generally believed that remittances have positive effects on volume of imports. On the contrary, if there is more imports than exports, it may run out trade deficit. It does make negative impact on the exchange rate of the home country. A weaker currency can raise the value of remittances sent back to the country, encouraging migrants to send more money home that influenced in growth of remittance. To analyze the relationship between remittance and imports, the study used annual data for 46 years from 1975 to 2020 A.D.

The main intention behind the designing of the scheme was to develop strategy for equitable use of water resources and involve communities, watershed and water user, in the sustainable management of water resources. We administered household survey in both the watershed community and water users to elicit their preferences regarding water source management and drinking water supply. A discrete choice experiment was employed in the case of water users which showed that, for them, water quality and quantity are the most important attributes. The estimated annual willingness-to-pay of water users for doubling water availability is NPR 482,076 (USD 4,505) and for doubling the water quantity and the supply of clean water that can be drunk directly from the tap is NPR 1.18 million (USD 10,988). The results of consultations with stakeholders indicate that the construction of public toilets, the regularization of grazing, off-season vegetable farming and drinking water distribution in the upstream area may contribute to maintaining the quality of water while keeping the watershed community satisfied with regard to water-sharing. These activities require NPR 1.17 million (USD 10,987) in the first year and NPR 425,640 (USD 3,978) annually from the second year on. The estimated willingness-to-pay and cost of the watershed activities indicate that implementing IPES in the Baitadi Town Water Supply Project is financially feasible and socially acceptable. Our study recommends the integration of the IPES design into the project design phase in future drinking water scheme, the best option being its integration into the initial environmental examination at the time of project design.",https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S2382624X18500029,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The paper shows that the remittance inflow and economic growth have bidirectional relationship in the long run, but there is no relationship in the short run. Remittance affects the dynamics of other variables like investment, financial development, and investment on human capital which indirectly affect the performance of the economy through these variables. Findings indicate that remittance could promote financial development in the short run. It also shows the possibility of negative shocks in remittance flow could have a permanent negative effect on educational attainment. It concludes that an environment for investment should be created for enhancing the role of remittance on economic growth.

Prior studies have focused on technical aspects of economic valuation such as biophysical quantification through modeling and mapping, or monetary valuation, while little attention has been paid to the social dimensions. Taking case studies of two dominant community-based forest management systems (community forestry—CF and collaborative forestry—CFM) in the Chure region of Nepal, we investigate how local users and other stakeholders perceive the valuation of forest-based ecosystem services based on proximity (nearby vs. distant users), socio-economic class (rich vs. poor users), and forest management modalities (CF vs. CFM). We found that local users and other stakeholders in the Chure region identified a total of 42 forest-based ecosystem services: 16 provisioning, 15 regulating, and 11 cultural services. While all local users prioritised firewood, water quality improvement, and bequest values as the top three services, genetic resources, hazard protection, and hunting services were valued as having the lowest priority. The priorities placed on other services varied in many respects. For instance, rich users living near a CF showed a strong preference for fodder, grasses, and soil conservation services whereas users living far from forests prioritised timber, fresh water, and flood control services. In the case of CFM, rich users adjacent to forests preferred timber, soil conservation, and carbon sequestration services but those living far from forests chose timber, poles, and flood control as their top priorities. Differences in rankings also occurred among the regional managers, national experts, and forest users. The reasons for these differences and their policy implications are discussed, and ways of reaching consensus between the users are suggested.",https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/10/5/421/pdf,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Absentees and dropouts impose a large resource cost on the educational system and the society. The study examines the economic cost of absentee and dropout students in public schools of Nepal. Using data from public schools in a rural municipality in Nepal, the study estimates the unit cost of absentee and dropout students by level. Cost of human resource, stationery, utility and fixed costs of building and furniture were the components for estimating unit costs. The findings reveal that the unit cost of students was equivalent to U.S. $295, 130 and 143 for primary, lower-secondary, and secondary levels respectively, and an average of U.S. $189 overall. The resource loss due to dropout was around 28, 12, and 11 percent of the total resource spent for primary, lower secondary and secondary levels respectively with an average of around 16 percent. The combined resource loss from dropouts and absentees were found to be 39, 23 and 20 percent for the different levels. On average, 26 percent of the public-school resource was lost due to dropouts and absentees. The main causes of dropout and absenteeism were the lack of interest, motivation of parents and the children to attend the school.

The results show that remittances have a strong positive association with trade deficits. Our findings indicate that remittances have contributed to trade deficits both in the long and short run. It suggests a symptomatic presence of ‘Dutch Disease’ leading to erosion in competitiveness and widening trade deficits. One way to reduce the ever widening trade deficit is to create conducive environment to channel the remittance on capital investment that supports the domestic production capacity.

This study is based on a detailed study of 32 sampled sites out of a total of 275 sites identified in Pokhara metropolitan city, and interviews with key informants in the concerned sites. The results show that there is no uniform trend in the change of open space. The area has remained constant in some sites whereas it has been decreased in some sites and also increased in some sites. Out of the total, 56.25 percent of patches remained constant in terms of area whereas 40.13 percent patches are decreased and increased in only 3.12 percent patches during the period between 1998 to 2018. There has been a net decrease of 24.652 hectors in the area in total. The increase of 3.12 percent attributed mainly to land pooling from individual ownership whereas the decrease is mainly due to the encroachment by individual people as well as for the construction of public infrastructure especially for expansion of the roads. The changes observed are not only limited to the change in the area but also the layout and the using pattern. Both the natural and the socio-economic factors including government policy are found responsible for such change.

Pressure necrosis by the inflated balloon is the commonest culprit. Post-intubation tracheal stenosis is a major indication for tracheal resection and anastomosis. This study was done to find out the indications and results of surgery for post-intubation tracheal lesions. Methods: It was a descriptive observational study of patients with post- intubation tracheal lesions managed in Manmohan Cardiothoracic Vascular and Transplant Center over a period of 20 years (2001 to 2021). Results: Twenty-five patients were treated for post-intubation tracheal lesions. Four had isolated tracheo-esophageal fistula (TEF); eighteen had an isolated tracheal stenosis and three had both. Most had a tracheal resection and end-end anastomosis (REEA) via a cervical approach, resecting an average of 2.7 cm of tracheal length. The average size of stenotic lumen was 4.32 mm. There were no operative deaths. Two patients expired within a month of surgery: one due to fatal restenosis and the other due to sepsis. There were a few immediate and a few long-term complications.

The study is based on reviewing and analyzing the documents relating to the defined objectives and targets, investment policies, investment portfolio, legal framework for investment, and achievements. The study finds that all three social security institutions (SSIs) end up investing the accumulated funds in fixed deposits in the banking and financial institutions (BFIs.). This is despite the act empowering them to mobilize the accumulated funds in several productive sectors and set competitive investment goals. This indicates that they fail to explore productive avenues for sustainable investment of the accumulated funds, which could contribute to the economic development of the nation.

This technique is based on a principle that bones or human body parts correlate positively with the stature. Stature can be estimated from measurements of various body parts such as arm, leg, feet, finger, facial height, nasal height etc. The aim of study was to correlate Stature of Nepalese with Nasal height and estimate Stature from Nasal height.Methods: A cross-sectional study of 214 healthy adults comprising 110 males and 104 females in the age group of 25 to 35 years were carried out. Study was carried out in central Nepal where people from various parts of Nepal are migrated. Total body height and Nasal height were recorded with stadiometer and sliding caliper respectively.Results: The mean of total body height in the male and female was 160.4 (±6.80) cm and 151.8 (±4.88) cm respectively. The mean of nasal height in the male and female was 4.6 (±0.31) cm and 4.3 (±0.29) cm respectively. This study observed that in both male and female nasal height had positive partial correlation with stature; r = 0.18 for male and 0.19 for female. Stature in nepali population could be calculated as: Stature=148.22+3.02x nasal height in male where as Stature=133.01+3.12x nasal height in female.Conclusions: Both Nepali male and female nasal height had positive partial correlation with stature; r = 0.18 for male and 0.19 for female.

This paper analyses this paradox by reviewing the growth of hydroelectricity sector in Nepal. It identifies four phases; the illustration of technical capacity, industrial training and early investments, major policy challenges and paradigm shift and maturing hydropower sector. The spread of improved water mills as well as hydro installations is also reviewed briefly. The paper argues that Nepal will meet much of its projected national demand very soon (2018/19) but attaining self-reliant energy security after displacing fossil fuel is not in the horizon yet. While substantial hydro investments are in the pipeline; a strong, diverse hydro-mechanical manufacturing industry is established. But the electro-mechanical industry is non-existent. Policies have attracted substantial private investment in hydropower sector, but it is not geared towards the use of electricity for overall economic development of Nepal and has yet to streamline policy with respect to lean season augmented flow of water for drinking and irrigation purposes within and outside Nepal. A more fundamental paradox is that Nepal government has yet to acknowledge these anomalies that hinder sustainable economic developments.HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water, Energy and Environment Issue: 23Year: 2018",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/20821/17098,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Nepal has also faced heavy agricultural land abandonment from the mountain regions in the last two decades. This study is concerned with agricultural land abandonment and its impact on soil erosion in the Madi Watershed, Gandaki Province of Nepal. This study used high-resolution aerial photography and Google Earth images to map cultivated land and its abandonment in 1995 and 2020. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model has been used to estimate soil erosion. Studies revealed that more than 40% of the agricultural land was abandoned from 1995 to 2020 and there is higher spatial variability of abandonment intensity. High altitude and steeper slope areas have a higher intensity of abandonment than in lower altitude and lower slope gradients. There is a significant impact of abandonment of agricultural land on reducing soil erosion from 1995 to 2020. The average rate of soil erosion was quite high in 1995 but decreased to 51.5 percent in 2020. There are higher rates of reduction in soil erosion at higher altitudes and marginal lands like steeper slopes and the areas having lower solar radiation because of the higher proportion of agricultural land abandonment. Thus, it can be concluded that agricultural land abandonment during the last 25 years significantly impacts soil erosion control in the study area.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/63935/48383,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The adoption of rain water harvesting was mostly driven by trainings that farmers received while controlling for age, poverty status and off-farm income. The adoption of RWH technology more than doubles household agricultural and livestock income. Instrumental variable approach was used to check the robustness of the findings. Adopters benefited from an increased supply of irrigation water, which allows them to diversify their crops from cereal production to high-value crops during dry season. Given the many weather-related uncertainties faced by rainfed farmers in Nepal, rain water harvesting is potentially a very useful climate adaptation strategy.

This study, therefore, aims to determine the impacts of livestock grazing on vegetation and soil quality in grasslands of core and buffer zones of KTWR. Less grazing intensity was observed at the core zone compared to the buffer zone. Livestock grazing was observed with negative impacts on the richness and diversity of the plant species causing changes in the community assemblages. Invasive plant species richness, however, was found higher in the low grazed areas. Differences in soil pH, phosphorus, and potassium content between high and low grazed areas were not observed. In contrast, soil electrical conductivity, bulk density, and nitrogen content were significantly higher in the high grazed areas.

Some go readily for treatment, others only when in great pain and in advance state of ill health. This is especially true for people with advance age who have to face many physiological changes which act as a barrier to seek immediate help in health care setting. Thus, a study was conducted to analyse the health seeking behaviour among elderly. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 104 elderly aged 60 years and above. Non- probability convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data. Data was collected by interviewing the elderly at their residence. The data gathered was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics in SPSS software. Results: Assessment of the health status of elderly people revealed that, majority of the participant’s 86.5% were suffering from chronic health problem, among them 37.8% suffered from hypertension 11.1% suffered from diabetic mellitus. Whereas, assessment of the practice of health seeking behaviour among elderly stated that all the participant’s 100%  were seeking help for health problem in which 83.7% seek help from modern medication and still 16.3% seek help from alternative medication.  Also, the health seeking behavior was found to be statistically significant with health problem (p=0.002), ethnicity (0.007) and religion (p=0.007) respectively.

A total number of five species of mushroom were collected including two wild (Morchella sp. and Ganoderma sp.) and three cultivated species (Pleurotus sp., Agaricus sp. and Lentinula sp). The moisture, protein, crude fat, total ash, dietary fibre and carbohydrates were determined as nutrients whereas phenolic content, flavonoid content, antioxidant and mineral matter were determined as nutraceuticals. In this study, the highest amount of nutrients contained was protein (34%), fat (7%), fibres (42%), ash (11%), and carbohydrate (60%). The nutraceutical in these mushrooms is phenolic (0.79 μg of GAE/gm), flavonoid (0.585 μg of QE/gm) and antioxidant (0.261±0.036 mg/ml). The concentration of iron (26.19 mg/l) was found highest in all mushrooms, whereas lead and chromium were found in negligible amounts i.e., >1. The comparative study revealed that the nutrients in cultivated mushrooms have highest than in wild mushrooms. Moreover, the nutraceutical is maximum in wild mushrooms (phenolic content of 0.79 μg of GAE/gm, flavonoid content of 0.58 μg of GAE/gm) than in cultivated mushrooms. Furthermore, wild edible mushrooms are a good source of antioxidants than cultivated ones.

There have been a number of damaging shocks in the last decade, including the 2015 earthquake and the COVID-19 pandemic, that have stopped the industry in its tracks. The effects of slow onset climate change are also impacting the industry and are forecast to get worse. An entrepreneurial ecosystem in Nepal has been established to foster resilience among participating businesses. This research addresses whether social capital contributes to the resilience of tourism startups in Nepal and whether an entrepreneurial ecosystem fosters that social capital. Further, it asks whether renewable energy and energy efficient practices have impacted resilience. And, finally, whether there is evidence of transformative change within the businesses studied. Results suggest that relationships generated through enduring historical shocks in the tourism economy in Nepal have fostered social capital, and that the entreprenuerial ecosystem has itself cultivated elements of social capital and resilience in the participating businesses. While firm conclusions could not be drawn as to whether transformative change has occurred in the businesses, the foundation for realising transformational opportunities has been established. This study suggests that resilience can be reframed from its historically ecological confines to be a more fluid and adaptable concept of human agency affected socio-ecological systems and may eventually allow, and be a driver of, transformational change in businesses participating in an entrepreneurial ecosystem.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/jtha/article/download/56189/42019,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Its therapeutic benefits are restricted by several adverse drug reactions (ADR). Therefore, it is necessary to measure its serum concentration for optimal dosing and clinical response and to minimize toxicity. The objectives of the study were to correlate dose of Lithium with its serum concentration and serum concentration of lithium with clinical effect. Material And Method: A cross sectional study was conducted in 213 patients presenting to psychiatric OPD, diagnosed with BPAD and taking Lithium monotherapy at least for 3 months. Data collection was done from 15th December 2018 to14th December 2019. Sociodemographic profile and relevant laboratory investigations were recorded on a self-designed proforma. Young Mania Rating Scale and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were applied for objective assessment of remission. Chi square test was used to correlate categorical data and ANOVA test was used for continuous data using SPSS at P-value of 0.05. Results: Majority of patients were male (51.6%), married (62.4%), Hindu (86.9%) and in remission phase (92%). Dose of lithium was 300-1200 mg/day; serum concentration was 0.26 to 1.51mmol/L, was in therapeutic range in majority of the patients (82.6%) and was positively correlated with the dose of lithium (P-value <0.0001). Conclusion: Lithium is very effective for maintenance therapy in BPAD with wide variation in dose and serum concentration. The dose of lithium should be guided both on the basis of clinical assessment and serum concentration.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JPAN/article/download/36281/28317,,SDG 15: Life on Land

It is used in seizure disorder, organicity, and psychiatric conditions. There is a paucity of literature with regard to the application of EEG in various conditions in our setting.Objective: The current study aims to explore the EEG findings of different cases and their associations in various clinical scenarios.Method: It is a retrospective study on the patients who underwent EEG in the EEG room of Department of Psychiatry at Patan Academy of Health Sciences (PAHS), Nepal for a year. Information was obtained from EEG register and reports. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 23. Frequency distribution was studied and Chi Square test was applied for categorical variables. The only continuous variable studied was the age for which mean, median and standard deviation were computed and the suitable statistical tool was applied after normality testing.Result: Of the total 164 patients studied, mean age was 21.93 years and 51.2% were male. The common reason for EEG referral was to rule out seizure disorder (80.5%), requested mostly from the department of Psychiatry. EEG abnormality was seen in 43.3% with EEG diagnosis of generalized epilepsy in 26.21% and slow wave (46.2%) as the most common EEG finding. Abnormal EEG detection rate was almost similar in both the genders and predominant in those with a clinical diagnosis of seizure disorder (47.88%). The EEG abnormality detection rate was significant in those referred from the Department of Psychiatry and Paediatrics.Conclusion: EEG is a relatively inexpensive and non-invasive test for detection of electrical activity in the brain.

Understanding the genetic variability of MAP, strains are important in diagnosis, epidemiological investigation, and therefore the formation of strategies for prevention and control of the disease. Thus, this study was designed to grasp the molecular characterization of MAP isolates of Nepal, as pioneer research of this area. Total of 46 MAP isolates obtained from cattle population of three different locations of dairy pocket areas of Chitwan, Nepal were typed using IS1311 polymerase chain reaction-restriction endonuclease analysis (PCR-REA) to research the MAP genotype of Nepal. The extracted DNA samples (n=46) were analyzed for the presence of MAP specific sequences (IS900) using PCR and DNA samples were further subjected to genotype differentiation using IS1311 PCR-REA and IS1311 L2 PCR-REA methods. All the DNA samples were positive for the entire three MAP specific sequences based PCRs. This study revealed that ‘Bison type’ strain is the single most prevalent MAP genotype circulating within the domestic cattle population of Nepal. IS1311 PCR-REA showed that MAP DNA samples of Nepal origin belonged to ‘Bison type’, whereas, IS1311 L2 PCR-REA method showed similarity with ""Indian Bison type"" and different restriction profiles of ‘Bison type’ genotype as compared to non-Indian strains. The study concludes that in Nepal, ""Bison type"" MAP stains was prevalent in all the MAP samples obtained from dairy cattle.

ASD is marked by core features including impaired social communication, and restrictive and repetitive behaviours and interest (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition: DSM 5). AAC is a specific type of assistive technology that can benefit person with autism (PWA) of all ages by promoting independence, expanding communication and increasing social interactions. The major objective of this paper is to analyse the current status of AAC assistive technology for person with autism (PWA) in Nepal. The paper first analysed the assistive technology in general and then is inclined toward the current status of its development in Nepal. The research methodology of the paper included interviews and discussion sessions. The data were further reviewed based on the reports from the relevant organizations and learning outcomes from different autism related trainings and workshops. The authors visited various organizations related to autism in Nepal, Autism Care Nepal Society (ACNS) and Special School for Disability and Rehabilitation Center (SSDRC) and carried out interviews and discussions and also participated in various autism related training sessions and workshops.

Riverine landscapes are process-response systems where river flow and geomorphology generate a heterogeneous physical template that influences ecological processes, suggesting that the supply of ecosystem services in riverine landscapes should be congruent with the character and heterogeneity of the physical template. In this study, we examine the congruency between the physical template (river functional process zones; FPZs) and the supply of river flow dependent ecosystem services from riverine landscapes of the Koshi River Basin, Nepal. The supply of ecosystem services was congruent with FPZs. Social factors were shown to mediate the use and value of ecosystem services between FPZs. Heterogeneity of the physical template interacts with place, social activity, and demography to influence the use and potential value of ecosystem services across the riverine landscape. These spatial patterns of greater use of some types of riverine ecosystem services in certain areas of the riverine landscape are indicative of a highly coupled agricultural or ""green loop"" social-ecological system (SES) and show that maintaining riverine template heterogeneity is an important element of this green loop SES that supports 40 million people in the Koshi River Basin.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/24694452.2023.2187338,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Most of our cancer patients present to the hospital quite late. In our everyday practice, we encounter many progressive incurable cancer patients who need palliative care. The goal of the palliative care is to relieve the pertinent symptoms or to improve quality of life (QoL) for patients with advanced cancer. We reviewed the palliative care services to the cancer patients at our center. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the cancer patients who received palliative care alone or in adjunct to curative treatment in Binayatara Cancer Center since its establishment in December 2018 was done. Results: A total of 108 patients received palliative care of which most were at advanced stage of disease (Stage IV). The male to female ratio was 1:1.45. The most common complaints for their visit was pain (62%) followed by nause and vomiting (32%), constipation (28%), anorexia (22%), shortness of breath, abdominal distension, seizure. Most of the patients with pain needed morphine (65%) for pain management followed by tramadol (25%) and NSAIDs (10%). Few of them were also supplemented with TCAs and anticonvulsants. Abdominal distension due to ascites was managed by ascitic tapping, Albumin supplementation while shortness of breath due to pleural effusion was managed by pleural fluid tapping. In one patient with pleural effusion, chest tube was inserted. Three patients with seizure due to brain metastasis were managed with anticonvulsant. A patient of prostate cancer with bony metastasis was managed with surgical orchidectomy. Conclusion: While considering the appropriate and effective use of palliative care, a palliative care physician is often confronted with a full range of multidisciplinary treatment options, and technical considerations that could potentially relieve some symptoms of advanced cancer in our settings.",http://jiomnepal.edu.np/index.php/jiomnepal/article/download/1096/1012,,SDG 15: Life on Land

However, the lack of sufficient study has created the possibility of unprecedented geohazards. In this study, a detailed geological and engineering geological mapping along with the geotechnical analysis of soils and sediments from the Bhainsepati–Pharsidol area of Lalitpur District has been carried out. Detailed geological maps and geological cross-sections were prepared on the scale of 1:25,000 following the most adopted stratigraphy of central Nepal for both hard rocks and Quaternary deposits. Two mappable geological units like the Tistung Formation and the Chandragiri Limestone of the Phulchauki Group are found within the hard rock succession at the study area’s hill sections. Similarly, the Quaternary succession is mapped into the Lukundol Formation and the Chapagaon Terrace deposits of Kathmandu Valley sediments from older to younger succession respectively. There is a distinct erosional unconformity between the rocks of the Phulchauki Group and the Quaternary Valley sediments. A kinematic analysis of discontinuities developed in the rocks was carried out in the rock slopes found in the area. Both field and laboratory analyses of soil samples were carried out for the representative samples. The laboratory tests include moisture content, specific gravity, particle size distribution, soil consistency, compaction, and consolidation properties. Finally, an engineering geological map was prepared on the same scale as geological mapping showing the details of the distribution of geo-materials.

About 56% of the households receive remittances, the country also has high rates of undernutrition as 36% of children under five years of age are stunted. Remittance are known to increase household income, potentially contributing to improvements in health and nutrition of children, but few studies have examined it in the Nepalese context. Methods: We used data of 2,498 children under 5 years of age from the Nepal Living Standard Survey 2010/11 to investigate associations between childhood stunting and household remittances. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of child stunting by remittances received by the families in the 12 months preceding the survey. Guided by a conceptual framework, the model was adjusted for variables representing child, maternal and household level characteristics. Results: Our investigation showed that the odds of a child being stunted decreased with increased levels of remittance received by households, 67% (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.67) lower for households receiving more than Nrs.60,000 remittance per year. However, there was no difference in the risk of stunting by gender of the household head and income categories.Conclusions: An increased household income could potentially reduce the burden of chronic undernutrition in poor families in Nepal, which in turn paves a path for the expansion of cash transfer programs. Further research is indicated to understand the threshold of remittance or cash transfer needed to estimate nutritional outcomes.Keywords: Income; nutrition; remittance; stunting",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Result: The results revealed 23.51% CL, 54.85% CLP and 21.64% CP. There were 58.21% males and 41.79% females. Positive family history of cleft was present in 28.0% and associated anomalies were observed in 3.7% of the cleft subjects. Mothers of 6.0% of the total patients were exposed to teratogenic agents during first trimester of pregnancy. Conclusion: It was concluded that among the three types of cleft (CL, CP and CLP), CLP is the most common type. The males are affected more with cleft lip and/or palate than the females. Clefts also have risks of associated congenital anomalies. Exposure to teratogenic agents in first trimester of pregnancy is also associated with orofacial cleft.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/OJN/article/download/25682/21452,,SDG 15: Life on Land

We applied Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis to see if the government's decision to end two nationwide lockdowns had an impact on the average daily new cases of COVID-19 reported in Nepal.   Method: ITS analysis on daily new cases of COVID-19 was performed for first and second nationwide lockdown on data of Nepal from data depository for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Impact of ''ending nationwide lockdown'' and possible associated factors were investigated. Result: The impact of removing first nationwide lockdown contributed to statistically significant rise of an average difference of 899 daily new cases due to community transmission of COVID-19. During second lockdown, even after imposing lockdown, cases overwhelmed existing healthcare system due to high infectivity of new Delta variant followed by a lack of adherence to public health measures and delayed decision to impose lockdown due to economic reasons. Whereas significant decline of cases was observed with an average difference of 2970 daily new cases after ending second nationwide lockdown mostly due to vaccine acceptance.   Conclusion: First lockdown was imposed early due to uncertainty about progression of disease, curative measures and unavailability of vaccines. Ending of first lockdown was done untimely due to economic reasons and festive seasons.  The unusual decline in cases after ending second lockdown could be contributed to increased vaccination in the country.  ",https://jgpemn.org.np/jgpemn/index.php/jgpemn/article/download/38/38,,SDG 15: Life on Land

It is inflammation of conjunctiva presenting as red eye. It is a communicable eye disease. Health education to the students and proper management can help spread of the disease. Knowledge of conjunctivitis among school students will help in prevention of the disease. So the study was carried out to assess the knowledge of conjunctivitis among high school students in Pokhara valley of Western Nepal. Materials/ Methods: A school based cross sectional study was performed among six government schools in western Nepal from May 2019 to June 2019. Students from grade eight, nine and ten were included in the study. Data was collected using structured questionnaire including demographic data, knowledge regarding sign symptoms of conjunctivitis, treatment, prevention, complication of conjunctivitis. Data was analysed using SPSS version 11.6. Result: A total of 523 students were included in the study. The mean age of the students was 14.7 ± 1.2 years with majority of females (53%). Nearly 2/3rd of the students (61.6%) had heard of conjunctivitis. Majority of the students (87.4%) of the students mentioned that it is communicable while 80.3% of the students correctly mentioned its etiology. Majority of the students (97.9%) mentioned that it is curable with treatment as first option (97.5%). Majority of the students (98.3%) correctly responded to the preventive measures but majority of the students (83.2%) wrongly mentioned mode of transmission. Conclusion: Secondary school students in Western Nepal have poor knowledge of conjunctivitis.

Though non-significant, higher number of fruiting branch, number of nodules, effective nodules, 1000 grain weight and harvest index were observed at 40 Kg ha-1 phosphorus. The findings suggested a gradual increase in the yield with increasing levels of phosphorus with the highest gross return from 60 Kg ha-1 phosphorus. However, since the variation in grain yield among the treatments was not significant, the cost involved with the 60 Kg ha-1 was greater as compared to 40 Kg ha-1 phosphorus, greater benefit was observed with the latter.

Primary data collected through household survey of 600 households, 100 from each district in Morang, Sarlahi, Bara, Chitwan, Rupandehi and Banke were analyzed using logistic regression technique. Results showed that western Terai dummy and family size were negatively affecting the adoption of forage and fodder production. Whereas access to credit, size of livestock holding and training were positively and significantly affecting the adoption of the forage and fodder production activity. The magnitude of effect of these significant variables are western Terai dummy (25.2%), family size (92.60%), access to credit dummy (74.21%), size of livestock holding (10.8%) and training dummy (188.80%). Findings of the study suggested that provided opportunity to dairy farmers for participation in training on livestock production management practices and increased access to credit for making investment in dairy enterprises.

It provides a wide range of services and is of particular interest from a land use land cover (LULC) change perspective as it is naturally fragile and prone to degradation. The study was conducted in Madhesh Province Siwalik to assess the LULC change over three time periods and to quantify the change in ecosystem services value (ESV) due to LULC change. Remote sensing, Google Earth Engine and Arc GIS were used to prepare the land cover map. In 2000, 2010 and 2020 total area covered by the forest was 68.46%, 65.58% and 71.17%, agriculture was 16.50%, 18.21% and 16.21% and waterbodies were 4.40%, 3.89% and 3.79% respectively. From 2000-2010 forest and waterbodies decreased by 3.87%, and 0.54% respectively whereas agriculture and other land increased by 1.7% and 2.71% respectively. Similarly, from 2010 to 2020, agriculture, water bodies, and other land decreased by 1.99%, 0.10%, and 4.48% whereas forests increased by 6.58% respectively. The overall accuracy of the map is 90%, 89% and 88% for the years 2000, 2010 and 2020. The ESV was estimated using the value transfer method, which was 28 million USD/year, 26.84 million USD/year, and 28.97 million USD/year in 2000, 2010 and 2020, which showed that the total ESV has decreased by 1.16 and increased by 2.12 million USD from 2000-2020. An elasticity indicator shows 1% of land conversion in Siwalik resulted in 0.47 % and 0.21 % changes in ESVs during the two periods, respectively. Overall findings of this study, suggest that ESV has increased in the Siwalik region of Madhesh province in the last two decades, primarily due to an increase in forest cover. This increase should be taken as an opportunity to leverage policy support and programmatic implementation to increase forest cover and reduce land conversion",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Interestingly, the prioritization of ES among stakeholders differed on the basis of their background, particular features of their landscape, professional engagement, and individual interests. For instance, forest users prioritized provisioning services for their daily needs whereas forest managers prioritized regulating and cultural services for overall ecosystem management and aesthetic values. Mapping of the ES from the landscape for 1995 and 2015 identified that forest area and associated ES have likely increased, especially in the upland regions, while agricultural land and their associated ES have decreased.

Data were collected during the monsoon season, after focused-group discussions and direct observations of farmers’ adaptation activities. We identified multiple approaches to Eco-DRR practices and significant differences in the community groups. To examine the impact factors, this study took 14 independent variables of households and assessed the most adapted structural measures from both Ecosystem services such as irrigation and watershed by applying the decision tree (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection; CHAID) model.

This study adapted IPCC (2001) methodology i.e. also used by C4 EcoSolutions on their baseline climate change vulnerability assessment. This is a bottom-up, integrative approach that considers both physical and social dimensions at a local level. Consequently, vulnerability is best understood as a function of three components: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Exposure to climate change vulnerability is calculated with sum of changes in temperature, changes in rainfall patterns, changes in rainfall intensity, drought episodes and flooding events. Sensitivity is calculated based on slope failures, soil fertility, changes in natural environment (i) soil cover; ii) levels of river sedimentation; iii) water salinity; iv) river ecosystems; v) forest size; and vi) the presence of invasive species), economic dependency level, irrigation facilities and livelihood sources. The major finding is that Chiti has been facing climate change since last decade and it is found severely vulnerable due to climate change. There is an urgent need of improvement on climate change adaptive capacity which could result of awareness, information on climate change and adaptation, surplus production and change in agricultural practices. The present study has used awareness score based on conceptual awareness, experiential awareness, and engagement of household to talk about climate change and adaptation. The Long Term Research Approach is appropriate to assess climate change vulnerability in community level. Climate change awareness is one of the major components to reduce vulnerability to climate change in the research area. This is a post adaptation vulnerability analysis of local community which supports climate change vulnerability adaptation policy.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/35557/27976,,SDG 15: Life on Land

To accomplish this task, Marxist, Post-Marxist theories are taken into consideration in order to indicate how an institution or the process of institutionalization as such is debated and perceived in social science academia. Likewise, the research also uses the popular research methodology of pragmatism which focuses on data collection, analysis and field study. The research is conducted in Sunil Smirti Gaupalika (Rural Municipality) of Rolpa district and focuses on the role of institutions in order to transform particularly the economic life of the people. The research divides institutions into two parts. The first one includes the governmental local institution Gaupalika. The second part includes INGO/NGOs. This division enables to decipher and historicize what these government and non government institutions have done independently and collectively to uplift the life of target group. The research finds that INGO/NGOs and locals institution in the remote village like Sunil Smirti Gaupalika have played significant roles on uniting the economically poor and make individual and collective efforts to fight against poverty. They work to find out the poor and economically weak section of the society by setting target group, generating the awareness and providing conductive environment for putting collective effort in their fight against poverty to a certain extent. Therefore, these two types of institutions have been found tremendously supportive in uniting what Marx calls “have-nots” of Sunil Smirti Gaupalika. However, the research also finds that mostly Brahmin/Chhetri communities have been benefitted by these programs. In comparison the ratio of economic growth between Brahmin-Chhetri community and Janjati community-Dalit community, the first one is found to be accelerating whereas the second one is slower and sluggish.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23420/19849,,SDG 15: Life on Land

A raw GCM analysis (based on historical observational data) from 29 GCMs was done first. The results shows with a subsequent degradation of ES providers like forests and an increment in agricultural and urban areas, ES are on a verge of degradation. Furthermore, a projection of future climate patterns depicts increased precipitation and temperature. Thus, urgent measures are required for the sustainable provision of ES.

It is estimated as pregnancy related maternal mortality ratio (PRMR) in Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). However, 2011 National Population and Household Census (NPHC) gave a very high estimate of this indicator and challenged the 1996 and 2006 NDHS estimates. This warrants the evaluation of these estimates using another reliable source and this study aims to fill that gap. Method: The 2003 Nepal World Health Survey (WHS) data files were used to get PRMR for 1995-2002. SPSS syntax was used to create sibling history to compute PRMR for the country. Standard error was computed to get 95% confidence interval (CI) and compare it with NDHS and NPHC estimates.  Result: Data quality of sibling history was found to be reliable for getting maternal mortality estimates as age and age at death data was good. Adjusted PRMR of 285 was obtained for 1996-2002 with 95% CI of 161-391. This CI overlapped for 2006 NDHS estimate but it did not overlap the 1996 NDHS and 2011 NPHC estimates.  Conclusion: PRMR from 2003 Nepal WHS were found to be consistent with 1996 and 2006 NDHS as per reported confidence intervals but it was not consistent with the 2011 NPHC estimate. As NPHC used indirect method due to poor data quality of observed deaths and live births, it cannot be considered as a reliable estimate of PRMR. Thus, it is recommended to use surveillance based methods to get valid and reliable estimate of PRMR and MMR for Nepal.

Using the time series data of 48 years of the study period from 1975 to 2022, Engle-Granger’s co-integration and error correction models are used to examine the fiscal effects on the trade deficit, and the ARDL model is used to examine the effects on current account deficit. The basic variables used in the analysis are government expenditure to GDP ratio, budget deficit to GDP ratio, trade deficit to GDP ratio, broad money supply to GDP ratio, trade openness, real exchange rate, and real per-capita Indian GDP. Data are taken from the Ministry of Finance, Nepal Rastra Bank, and World Development Indicators. The findings show that the government expenditure to GDP ratio and trade openness positively affect the trade deficit as domestic factors, while real per-capita Indian GDP positively affects the trade deficit as an external factor. Also, the budget deficit to GDP ratio has a positive effect, while the broad money supply to GDP ratio has a negative effect on the current account deficit as domestic factors. The real exchange rate is negatively and real Indian per-capita GDP are positively driving the Nepal’s current account deficit as external factors. This study identifies the real exchange rate with Indian rupees, Indian real per-capita GDP, and financial development as novel explanatory variables of current account deficit and therefore provides additional evidence on external deficit in the context of Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/68023/52145,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The wide and increasing availability of census and socio-economic data, tools like GIS with an ease to use and advances in methodology has allowed increasing and refined GIS mapping of census variables. However, it is less emphasized that the result of analysis and presentation is always dependent on the unit of analysis. Data aggregation, choice of data classification method and spatial scale all have effect on mapping result. When administrative boundaries are restructured, it necessitates the aggregation of census data of one administrative level to another. In this context, the current paper explores the scale and zoning effect (changing boundary, changing number of units and data aggregation) on mapping census data. It explores the effect of four data classification methods at two spatial scales. Secondary data sources like local administrative boundary of Bajhang district and economically active population in agriculture is selected as representative census variable for mapping. GIS tool is applied for data mapping and analysis. The study found the higher calculated correlation value (0.88) for the restructured spatial units. The distribution of number of spatial units varied significantly between four data classification methods while plotted against the old boundary but there was not much variation in case of newly restructured boundary. The study found that zoning particularly, from smaller to larger units has blurred the spatial pattern visualization leading to a loss of the preferential information. The study concludes that the restructuring of administrative boundaries into larger unit has simplified the detail for spatial representation and has introduced additional generalization. For policy level analysis, use of data available at one level of the spatial unit when aggregated to higher level should be analyzed carefully using different data classification methods and visualization tools because scaled spatial representation matters in planning and policy aspect. It is meaningful to analyze data at different spatial scale to visualize and identify spatial variation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23413/19842,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Mechi and Mahakali Rivers and their tributaries mark the international boundaries between Nepal and India. All of these originate either from the Himalayas or from the Tibet Plateau and are perennial. However, dams and other water development projects, intensive fishing, pollution, and extensive human disturbances have decreased the abundance of the Ganges River Dolphin, which is now restricted only to the Koshi and Karnali River systems and in an isolated form. The first Integrated Dolphin Census of Nepal, conducted in 2016, recorded 52 dolphins throughout the country. Of the 52 dolphins, 43 were sighted in the Mohana of Karnali and its tributaries. No dolphins have been recorded recently for the Mahakali river, and sightings in the Narayani river, are occasional. The population of the River Dolphins is declining at an alarming rate. Therefore, it is important to regularly assess the status and trends of their populations and design strategies for their conservation and sustainable use.",https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/msup/aehm/article-pdf/26/1/32/1990773/32labh.pdf,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The misinterpretation of feuds between families invited mistreatment, and as a result, the Nepali state imposed land-reform program policies in 1964, more so due to pressure by the communist movement. This pushed the feudal farmers into poverty. The study highlights historical ways of failure of development of organic capitalism in Madhes. Contemporary work in Marxism, especially in Madhes, tends to focus on interpretation, and understanding of feudalism/landlordism among communist leaders, scholars, workers and activists. Marxist discourses and precepts have reflexively impeded the development of capitalism in Madhes.

According to the estimates provided by the UN Maternal Mortality Inter-agency Group (MMEIG), the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) started from a high of 901 in 1990, dropping to 258 in 2015, or a reduction of 71% over the 25 year period. Between 2000 and 2015, MMEIG estimates showed a reduction of 53%. The MMR is targeted to be reduced to at least to 70 by 2030. This implies a reduction of 73%, which is considerably higher than the reduction recorded during the earlier (2000-2015) period (which was 53%), or annualized rate of decline of 8.7% v 5.0%. Therefore, the future trajectory warrants undertaking strategic interventions more intensively than what may have been hitherto.

The data used for the analysis are based on national surveys conducted in 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2016. The data demonstrate that, since the early 2000s, Nepal has made remarkable progress toward closing the gender gap in educational attainment. By the early 2010s, educational attainment by female young people had risen sharply, such that the large gender gap that previously existed had narrowed significantly. However, as of 2016, the data also indicate that 3.1% of male youth and 7.5% of female youth were still deprived of any education at all. Further, those deprived of education were concentrated in the age group 20–24, married, belonged to poor households, represented ethnic minorities, and resided in particular geographic areas of the country.

Despite development in the level of health education expertise in human resources and institutional obstetric care in our country, the delay in early recognition of the problem, transportation to proper health facility and getting proper expert care are major hurdles to reduce complications. Therefore we decided to study feto-maternal outcomes in our setting.Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional hospital based study carried out in Nobel Medical College, Biratnagar, from 17th June 2014 to 16th June 2015. Details and data obtained from Medical Record Section were analysed. All patients with eclampsia were included and fetomaternal outcomes measured in terms of complications. Simple descriptive statistical method was applied for analysis.Results: Among 8,066 deliveries, 112 had eclampsia with incidence of 13.8/1000 deliveries. Majority (41%) were of <19 years of age. Above 90% were unbooked. Aoubt 63.4% were primiparas and 83% had antepartum eclampsia. Eclamptic fits were more common (41.6%) in 37-40 weeks period of gestation. Fits to delivery interval was more than six hours in 89.1% women and 69.3% women underwent caesarean delivery. About 18.9% women developed eclampsia related complications. Common causes of maternal deaths (5.36%) were pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, cerebrovascular accidents and HELLP syndrome. Perinatal death was nine percent.Conclusions: Although the obstetric care facilities are improving with time, the feto-maternal outcomes are still poor in our country.

The current study is an attempt to explore potential risk with respect to physical infrastructure and assess modeled and actual physical damage and human loss caused by different earthquake scenario and actual 2015 earthquake event in Thecho of Kathmandu valley. The earthquake scenario is based on two nearest fault lines. Risk Assessment Tools for the Diagnosis of Urban Seismic Risk (RADIUS) method has been applied for estimation of potential building damage and casualties..The research has adopted integrated approach using secondary and primary data sources such as field observation, key informant survey and building survey through purposive random sampling.The study found that potential building damage estimated by RADIUS for Gorkha 2015 earthquake scenario and North-west (Khokana) are lower than the actual post-earthquake assessment whereas North earthquake scenario resulted higher loss. Actual damage caused by 2015 earthquake compared to modeled damage from RADIUS is found higher because additional damaged were made by successive aftershocks. Spatial distribution of potential building damage for earthquake scenarios and actual 2015 earthquake event is also variable. North-Nuwakot Earthquake Scenario resulted more hazardous than the North-Khokana scenario though the location of epicenter is relatively farther with high intensity.

Death toll was nearly 9,000 and hundreds of thousands of inhabitants became homeless. The earthquake severely damaged mainly surface structures of hydro projects, access roads, clay mortar stone masonry houses and structurally weak concrete houses. Landslides, rock falls, debris flow, liquefaction, river damming, Landslides Dammed Outburst Flood (LDOF) and Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) are expected earthquake-induced hazards.

In hydro projects damages were recorded in surface structures such as power house, settling basin, penstock pipes, and diversion weir constructed at base of steep terrains. For instance, surface penstock pipe, lying at base of rock cliff, of running 40 MW Upper Bhote Koshi Project was ruptured by rock falls and as a result flooded surface powerhouse located downstream by water from penstock and headrace tunnel. Similarly, diversion weir, surface settling basin and headrace penstock pipe of running 5 MW Mialung Project were also severely damaged by slides and rock falls. On the other hand, only minor cracking of sprayed concrete at corners and protruded edges in underground structures were observed. In hydro projects, there is a practice of considering seismic load in design of structures but the effects of earthquake induced hazards were not foreseen. This devastating earthquake gave good lessons for design considerations of hydro projects in future.

Landslide hazard assessment is the primary tool so as to understand the nature and characteristics of the slope that are prone to failure. Logistic Regression Model is used for the preparation of landslide hazard map of the Besi Shahar-Tal area in Marsyangdi River basin in west Nepal. The causative factors such as elevation, slope, slope aspect, land use, geology, rainfall, lineament density, stream density are used. All the thematic layers of these parameters are prepared in GIS and logistic regression analysis is done by using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS).

Diabetes was diagnosed on the basis of treatment history and random blood sugar test results of greater than 200 mg/dl. Diabetic retinopathy screening was done by ophthalmologists. All relevant data were imported into the RAAB software package (RAAB V.6) for analysis.Results: Among 4615 study population, 2.8 % (n=129) had diabetes, and 35.7% (n=46) of the diabetics were newly identified cases. Of the known diabetics, 61.4% (n=51) never had an eye examination, and only 27.7% (n=23) of cases had their eye checked for DR in the last year. Fundus examination showed 13.2 % (n=17) of the diabetic patients to have some form of diabetic retinopathy and 6.2% (n=8) had diabetic maculopathy. Only 0.8% (n=1) of the cases were categorized as sight-threatening DR but a greater number of diabetes patients had severe visual impairment or blindness (3.9%) as compared to non-diabetic patients (1.8%).Conclusions: Prevalence of diabetes and DR were relatively lower in Far-western Nepal. However poor coverage of screening examinations have left many of these cases undetected in the communities. Effective community-based diabetes and DR screening and referral programs can help to detect and treat diabetes and DR early on to prevent vision loss and other diabetic complications.

This study analyzes the spatiotemporal variations of LULC change and examines its impact on lake environment of Phewa, Begnas and Rupa lakes during 1975–2018 by using Landsat satellite images and data from published literatures. Results showed that from 1975 to 2018, forest cover and agriculture land in catchments of all three lakes has decreased, while the built-up area has increased. LULC change in the catchment have bought the significant impact on the lake environment in terms of sedimentation rate, physiochemical parameters and biological environment. From 1975 to 2000 forest cover in lakes catchment has decreased, whereas the agriculture land has increased. At the same time, sediment and agriculture based nutrient loading into lakes has increased indicated by changes in sedimentation rate and alteration of physiochemical properties of the lake. From 2000 to 2018, forest and built-up area has increased while the agriculture land has decreased in lakes catchment. From 2000 to 2018, sedimentation rate of lakes has decreased compared to before 2000. Decreased sedimentation rate was interpreted due to increase in forest cover in the lake catchment.

This study aimed to find out the prevalence of hypertension and its determinants among the school going adolescents of Kathmandu, Nepal. Methods: This was a descriptive cross sectional study which included five private secondary schools of Kathmandu, Nepal. The adolescent students studying in classes VIII, IX and X were the study subjects. Two stage cluster random sampling technique was used to select 356 participants. Data collection was done by doing anthropometric measurements, blood pressure measurement and through self administered questionnaire. Results: The study depicted that the prevalence of elevated blood pressure was 12.4%, stage 1 hypertension 32.3% and stage 2 hypertension 9.8%. Similarly, 13.8% were overweight and 1.4% were obese. Bivariate analysis depicted significant association of prevalence of hypertension with gender, religion and obesity (p < 0.05). The multivariate analysis shows that the significant predictors of elevated blood pressure and/or hypertension were gender and obesity. Males were six times more likely to have elevated blood pressure (AOR = 6.058, CI = 2.571 - 14.274) and 2.8 times more likely to be hypertensive (AOR = 2.838, CI = 1.688 - 4.773) compared to females. Similarly, compared to obese/ overweight students, thin and normally built ones have less likelihood of having elevated blood pressure and hypertension. Conclusions: Hypertension has been prevalent among adolescents, due to various behavioural risk factors. This is really challenging and of public health significance. Regular screening of adolescents is essential for early detection and management of hypertension.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNPS/article/download/25377/23550,,SDG 15: Life on Land

But the urban areas still have rural characteristics and insufficient infrastructures. Due to the increasing urbanization, the maintenance of sufficient open spaces, greeneries and the preservation of agricultural lands has become important urban issues in Nepal. The loss of productive lands has resulted in decrease of food self-sufficiency and green spaces in the cities.

A 1:25,000 scale geological map was prepared, and representative rock samples from each stratigraphic unit were systematically collected for petrographic analysis. Fourteen thin sections were examined to understand the deformation and metamorphism in the region. Field observations such as fault breccias, fault gouge, lineation, and slickensides, along with petrographic evidence of inverted and dynamic metamorphism, cataclastic deformation, and ribbon quartz, suggest the presence of a thrust equivalent to the Mahabharat Thrust (MT), a significant tectonic feature in the study area. Microstructural indicators like undulose extinction, grain boundary migration, recrystallisation, and deformation lamellae in quartz further confirm this thrust's existence. Two distinct carbonate successions were identified: the southern unit correlates with the Lesser Himalayan sequence, while the northern, more metamorphosed carbonate unit is associated with the Bhimphedi Group, part of the Jajarkot Thrust Sheet. Stratigraphic continuity is disrupted in some sections, where quartzite and schist replace the basal carbonate strata, likely due to thrusting. The thrust's propagation has impacted both footwall and hanging wall rocks, evidenced by features such as rotated garnets with spiral inclusions. Three metamorphic zones—chlorite, biotite, and garnet isograd—indicate progressive metamorphism linked to thrust tectonics, revealing an inverted metamorphic sequence in the region.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/74582/57759,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Data were obtained from, World Development Indicators from 2001 to 2019 published by World Bank. Initaly, the trend of all variables was monitored using graphs. Then, fixed effect model was applied as suggested by Hausman test in which only exchage rate was found significantly negatively related with trade balance. Due to serial correlation problem with fixed effect mode, data were further analysed through panel ARDL / PMG and found the evidences of long-run relationship among the variables. It was also found that inflation, exchange rate, and GDP had significant positive relationship with trade balance in long-run whereas GCE had significant negative impact on it. Interestingly, FDI did not have significant contribution on trade balance in long-run. None of variables were found to be significant in short run. However, all selected variables affected signifcantly to trade balance in short-run while testing cross-section wise. Finding of this research has an important implication to South Asian countries for making concensus in desiging common currency to fight against the growing concern of trade deficit in the region.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/55073/42215,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Various classes of carbapenemases had been reported in Nepal. Most frequent was the New Delhi Metallo beta lactamase with many variants where NDM-1 was most prevalent. Similarly, Oxacillinase and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase producers were also prevalent in Nepal. While other carbapenemases like VIM, IPM, and DIM also detected. The isolates producing carbapenemases were extremely drug-resistant as they also co-produced various other carbapenemases, beta-lactamases, 16S rRNA methylase. Most isolates were resistant to many members of carbapenem, cephalosporin, quinolone, penicillin, aminoglycoside group of antibiotics. Such isolates had very few treatment options as only last line drugs like colistin, fosfomycin, and tigecycline was effective against most of these isolates. Carbapenemase production by almost all major human pathogens including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter. Citrobacter, Proteus, Providencia is a matter of concern because some of these enzymes are located on plasmids and pose rapid dissemination among various gram-negative pathogens. Timely surveillance for carbapenemase producers throughout the nation, their proper treatment, and proper hospital hygiene to prevent nosocomial infections by carbapenemase producers, controlled use of carbapenems, educating health care workers, students and the general public about the adverse effects of antimicrobial resistance is imminent.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Method: In order to identify EbA options, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, governance and socioeconomic function of CF were analyzed. Effectiveness and sustainability were examined and compared through Land Use Land Cover (LULC) database during 1996 and 2021. Efficiency was explored through the economic valuation of provisioning and cultural services, using economic approach–revealed price (market price) method. Socioeconomic functions and governance were examined through the existing plans/policies and secondary data review. Findings: CF is effectively and sustainably managing the available resources. It has increased forest cover, water body, grassland and remarkable decline in bush and sand area. Bush area (79.25 ha in 1996) dropped (to 6.52 ha in 2021) while forest cover increased from 340.46 ha to 375.54 ha. Waterbody (pond or lake area) was limited to 0.88 ha that expanded to 5.04 ha in 2021 due to the conservation oriented management practices. Meanwhile, economic value of provisioning services is USD 7182 accounting wood and timber the highest (average annual USD 4800) among the provisioning services while average annual value of firewood and poles is USD 1367 and NTFP (fish and rubber) is USD 1015 whereas the economic value of cultural services is USD 18803. Novelty: The novelty of the research work lies in the unique methodology and the selection of CF for the EbA case study, which is least explored. By exposing the integration of ecological and socio-economic considerations, this research underscores the significance CF as EbA option in shaping sustainable development pathway in Nepalese context.

It represents a group of heterogenous disease with diverse biologic, clinical and molecular characteristics requiring personalized treatment. Based on Immunohistochemical markers, breast cancer is classified into distinct molecular subtypes. The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of molecular subtypes of all breast cancer patients treated at University Hospital of Nepal in the period over 3 years. Methods: A retrospective observational study was carried out in Breast Unit of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu. Electronic medical records of all breast cancer patients treated between January 2017 to December 2019 were retrieved from the hospital database. Patient’s characteristic, histological features and molecular subtypes were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 156 surgically treated breast carcinoma patients were studied. The median age of study population was 55 years (range 28–82years). Among these, 69 (44%) were of ≤45 years and 87 (56%) were over 45 years. The mean tumor size was 29 mm (range 50-140 mm). The most common histology was invasive ductal carcinoma (93.5%). Luminal type A was positive in 68 (43%) patients while luminal type B was present in 12 (7.6%) patients. Triple negative subtype was observed in 50 (32%) patients while HER2 rich subtype was seen in 25(16%). Incidence of Triple negative subtype was highest in patients less than 45 years (42%). Luminal A subtype was correlated with low tumor grade and less positive lymph nodes metastasis. Conclusion: The most common molecular subtype of breast cancer in Nepal is Luminal A having favorable features.

Each formation is further divided into three members; the lower, middle and upper, based on the ratio of mudstone vs. sandstone beds as well as color and grain size of sandstone. The Jagati Formation is characterized by reddish-brown mudstones interbedded with very fine- to coarse-grained sandstones. Paleosols characterized with burrows, rhizoliths, desiccation cracks, concretions and nodules are present in higher proportion than thinly laminated or massive mudstone beds. The Kala Formation comprises thin- to thick-bedded, very fine- to very coarse-grained sandstones and pebbly sandstones interbedded with reddishbrown, greenish-grey to dark-grey mudstones. Sandstone beds exhibit ""salt and pepper"" appearance. In the lower part of the upper member sub-rounded to rounded pebbles are scattered along with trough and planar cross-laminations in sandstone beds, whereas the gravel size tends to be larger and few cobble size gravels also appear in the upper part. Thinly laminated or massive mudstones are common and paleosols are less frequent. The age of the boundary between the Jagati and Kala Formations (Lower-Middle Siwaliks) is around 11.05 Ma. The boundaries age between the middle and upper members of the Jagati Formation is around 12.7 Ma and between the lower and middle members of the Kala Formation is around 9.0 Ma.

This is the first issue of volume 25 of JSSN. I take this opportunity to thank all the stakeholders of the JSSN and especially the founder of the JSSN.   A journal is a tool for publishing research and it is important to ensure that the research can be used by the community. They are important tools to disseminate scientific knowledge, improve the quality of research, identify new trends and provide a platform for published authors to showcase their work. Realizing this and with limited resources and experience in publishing, back in 1998 Prof. K. D. Joshi and his team published the first issue of the Journal of Society of Surgeons of Nepal. Because of their initiation, dedication and hard work, today we are here with this 25th volume to you.   The journal is an essential part of the scientific community, and it is essential for the advancement of knowledge. It is an important step in getting published, but publishing a journal is challenging especially in developing countries. Developing countries face unique challenges as compared to developed ones. The challenges of publishing in developing countries include lack of funds and limited resources, low quality of submissions, lack of qualified reviewers and editors, lack of publishers' support, low standards of proofreading etc. Scientific journals have become expensive to produce and there is little or no financial support available for their production. The costs include printing, distribution costs, website hosting and maintenance costs. While the whole of the editorial team are volunteers and some even have to spend out of their pocket for the journal. That’s the reason why there are not enough qualified volunteers for the editorial job in the journal. Most of the burden of work is on one or two persons. The most significant challenge is to get the right kind of peer review as peer review is also a volunteer task. Many authors who send the articles to the journal want early publication. But they don't have time to review articles for the same journal.   We while publishing JSSN face similar challenges. We are thankful to those who spent and are spending time and money on this novel task. This includes all past chief editors, editors, peer reviewers and technical staff.   Despite the challenges, JSSN is moving on to maintain national and international standards. We developed our online platform for article submission, processing and publication in 2014. Now all the new issues after that and most of the previous issues are available online. We received two stars (out of three) in the journal publishing practices and standards (JPPS) framework (https://www.journalquality.info)  in 2020 AD and working on getting three stars. We were able to get indexed in a reputed and prominent Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ, doag.org) in 2021.   Meeting the international standards and getting an index on a different platform is difficult because of a lack of funds and dedicated manpower for the journal. It also requires specific stringent criteria which need subscriptions to service and payment per article or yearly basis which is a burden for publishing societies. Publishing societies should support the journal to go ahead and be of international standard with additional cost if required.   The scientific community needs access to quality peer-reviewed journals that are accessible to researchers from developing countries. To reach this goal, we must invest more resources into supporting the journals and ensuring that they are sustainable. Journal is the face of a professional society like ours and is also one of the most important activities of society.  We are thankful to the Society of Surgeons of Nepal for the support which we have received till now. We hope JSSN will get more support and encouragement in future for the improvement of the quality of the journal and meeting ever-increasing international criteria of journal standards. Once again, we would like to thank all our readers, authors, peer reviewers, present and past editors and technical team for their support.

Primary aim was to measure adherence to anti-hypertensive medication and factors associated with low adherence.Methods: Morisky Medication Adherence Scale was used for measuring medication adherence and a structured questionnaire for measuring background and illness related factors in a cross-sectional study among 216 hypertensive patients in a tertiary care hospital selected through sequential sampling. Data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics and results presented with proportion or odds ratio with 95% CI.Results: It was found that 72% of the patients had low adherence to anti-hypertensive medication, with sub-group differences notably higher among females (77%); among those with co-morbidity (80%); and among those getting medicines free of cost (76%). Post multivariate logistic regression, it was found that patients with co-morbidity had higher odds of having low adherence (Adjusted Odds Ratio – AOR: 2.50; 95%CI:1.28-4.89) than those without; and those who get medicine free of cost had higher odds of having low adherence (AOR: 3.01; 95%CI:1.32-6.86) than those who pay for medicine.Conclusions: A substantial proportion of hypertensive patients had low adherence to medication. Presence of co-morbidity, getting medicine free of cost, and not having regular follow up were the major factors associated with low adherence to anti-hypertensive medication. Targeted interventions in hospitals and health care centers in Nepal would improve medication adherence.

So, this study aimed to find out the prevalence of burnout in dental practitioners of Nepal and its association with different demographic and practice-related variables. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess outcomes among dental practitioners registered with the Nepal Dental Association from June to July 2021. All members were sent an online form to be filled out through emails. The questionnaire consisted of demographic and practice-related variables details along with a 16-item Oldenburg Burnout Inventory to assess burnout. Exhaustion and disengagement were the two components that were assessed with the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Statistical package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v 11.5 was used for data analysis. Mean, standard deviation, percentage were calculated and chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test were employed for inferential analysis. Results: A total of 155 dental practitioners were included in the study. The mean age of the participants was 32.44 years (SD: 5.20). The prevalence of burnout was found to be 69.7%. The number of practitioners with low exhaustion and low disengagement was 18 (11.6%) only. Burnout was more common among younger (p=0.043) and unmarried (p=0.017) participants. Conclusions: A big proportion of dental practitioners reported burnout. Further research is warranted to identify the stressors causing burnout. Concerned authorities should take note of this phenomenon and work towards reducing it  ",https://nmj.com.np/nmj/index.php/nmj/article/download/153/152,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The term PBC is coined to describe the fluctuation in economic activities from the intervention of the political actors before the election expecting to be re-elected in the forthcoming election. The abuse of political power in manipulating fiscal and monetary policies by the ruling party prior to the election period has become normal in developing countries like Nepal. The incumbent tries to convince their voters by increasing the size of the populist public expenditure before or during the election period. Nepal can’t be exceptional in the case of public resource manipulation during the time of the election. Democracy was restored in Nepal after the people’s political movement of 1990 and after that six consequent general elections were completed. The study used the annual data set from 1990/91 to 2017/18 and employed the ordinary least square method in three different models to capture the relationship among the variables used in the study. Real GDP, government consumption expenditure, and fiscal deficit are used as dependent variables of each model whereas government capital expenditure, transfer payment and subsidy, and total tax revenue are taken as independent variables under the study along with introducing election as a dummy variable. The results showed a positive relationship between the variables, but not enough to confirm the opportunistic political business cycle. The study recommends policymakers ensure policy consistency considering non-intervention in fiscal policies at the time of election.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/55074/42216,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Similarly, more than three million women suffer from severe complications from unsafe abortion every year. In 2002, responding to the public voices and high attribution of unsafe abortion on maternal mortality, Nepal granted legal access to safe abortion introducing safe abortion act. Women can seek abortion up to 12 weeks of gestation for any indication. However, sex selective pregnancy termination is prohibited in Nepal.

For this achieving the purpose, secondary data of 1975 to 2017 have been used, which are referenced from the Nepal Rastra Bank. The analysis methods has been used the Auto Regression Model and Granger-Causality Tests for achieved the results. The result of the study reveals that there is a significant relationship between the export and economic growth of Nepal. The result showed when export increases by 1 unit then GDP increases by 0.58 units in short run. It indicates that current GDP growth is also affected by past year’s export. Similarly, Granger causality test also shows that export trade caucused to economic growth (p=0.0071) and foreign loan also caucused to economic growth (p=0.0410). It shows that there is a unidirectional causality with economic growth in Nepal. Hence, this study suggests that the policy makers should focus on exportable products which have potential for larger scale productions within the country, and comparative advantage for export trade as well as economic growth in Nepal.

As the urbanization is growing in the Kathmandu Valley the banks of the streams are being targeted for the housing and roads, therefore it is important to know the characteristic of the river behavior, nature of erosion and sediment production along its banks. This study accesses the stream bank erosion characteristics and sediment production by erosion along the Godavari Khola. It was conducted by surveying and accessing hydraulic parameters, Bank Erosion and Lateral Instability status, streambank recession rates and gross sediment erosion from the bank. The Godavari Khola has high bank erodibility and lateral instability as the hazard level of Bank Erosion and Lateral Instability (BELI) and width/depth ratio are quite high. Since the slope and the bankfull depth exceed the critical slope and critical depth values, respectively, the Godavari Khola is competent enough to mobilize its sediments. The apparent recession rate of the banks of the Godavari Khola is 0.66 m per year yielding 85 m3 volume of the displaced material which weighs 141 tonnes. The estimated bank erosion rate is in between 0.02 to 0.235 m/y and the gross erosion is estimated to be 320 tonnes per year. Similar to the other river of the Kathmandu Valley, the Godavari Khola is very disturbed by the anthropogenic activities.

The present paper discusses the availability of biodiversity resources and its contribution in the livelihood of local people in Lamabagar Village Development Committee, Dolakha district, Nepal. The results show that the livelihood of local people depends on biodiversity resources and people use these resources as fuel wood, timber, fodder and forage for household consumption. In addition, these resources are used as raw materials for local industry such as paper industry and are exported to other market towns to sell and generate income. Bio-diversity resources contribute about 22 per cent of the total household income in the study area.

The world’s slate market is the third in importance for natural stone, just after granite and marble. Most of the world’s production of roofing slate is concentrated in Spain. There are new emerging countries (Brazil, China, India and Nepal) with huge resources of roofing slate. However, many of these resources are not yet well studied. Nepalese slate industry is still incipient, although most of the houses have been constructed using roofing slate since historic time. The representative three samples were taken for quality assessment from Tanahun and Baglung districts. From a geological point of view, the productive formations are the Benighat Slates and Nourpul Formation, but other formations are likely to be potential slate sources. Previous studies have shown an important reserve of slate which needs detailed investigation. Petrography and mineralogy of representative Nepalese slates are similar to the rest of the world’s roofing slate. The test results showed values within the acceptance thresholds for roofing slates.

Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are must to reduce morbidity and mortality due to following diseases. Therefore authentic data on these issues are of great importance. The aim of this study was to address this gap and create awareness regarding essence of control of Diabetes and Hypertension among political cadres of Nepal as they play major role in policy making. Materials & Methods:A descriptive cross-sectional study in the political cadres of Nepal was conducted at Pragya Bhawan, Kathmandu on 4th March, 2012 where delegates attended their 3rd National assembly. Standard criteria were used to describe both Hypertension and Diabetes and their respective goals. Awareness and treatment were based on self-report.Results:A total of 291 subjects were included in the study. The prevalence of hypertension was 44.32% while that of Diabetes was 18.56%. The current blood pressure of the study population was 50% within normal range and 50% of them was above normal range, body mass index of 35% was normal and rest was above normal range. 15% of the study population was known diabetic while 33% was known hypertensive. More than 50% of known diabetics had poor control over blood sugar and 72% of the known hypertensive had poor blood pressure control.Conclusion:The scenario of hypertension and diabetes control among the political cadres is not up to the mark. Most of those already having the disease have poor control of blood pressure and blood sugar level. From this, the situation obviously seems more warning in general population and needs well-designed assessment. ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JCMSN/article/download/17694/14996,,SDG 15: Life on Land

Material And Method: The participants were psychiatrists (qualified and psychiatry residents). An online questionnaire using Survey Monkey electronic Platform was emailed with a uniform resource locator (URL). Results: Sixty-four out of ninety-five participants responded with response rate of 65.3%. Two-third of the respondents were qualified psychiatrists. The duration of neurology rotation ranged from 1 to 3 months and it was reported to be mandatory. Two-thirds reported that there is no clinical neuropsychiatry training during psychiatry residency.

The history of forest management in Nepal is closely associated with the political and economic history of the country. Any change in economic and political and economic situation also directly or indirectly changes the forest management practices of Nepal. The main objective of the study is to analyze the historical development of forest management of Nepal from political and economic perspective. It is a historical and descriptive nature of the study i.e. fully based on the secondary sources of data and information in order to have better understanding about the political and economic effects on forest management practices. The key political changes in the country have been divided into five different periods and thereby notably changes in forest management practices which is starting from the state control and exploitation of forests to people's participation, protection, and conservation, sustainable, and scientific forest management. People's participation in forest management has been widely accepted in legal as well as policy level.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/36030/28136,,SDG 15: Life on Land

The household survey revealed an average per capita household waste generation rate of 120 g/capita/day. The total Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation is estimated about 15 tons/day and 5475 tons/year. The analysis of household waste composition indicated that the highest waste category was organic waste with 80% followed by plastics with 10%, paper and paper products with 6% and inert with 4%. The composition analysis of institutional wastes revealed 41% paper and paper products, 33% plastics, 13% organic wastes and 13% inert. The study found that commercial waste comprised 59% paper and paper products, 21% plastics, 17% organic and 3% inert.

Road traffic injuries are a major global public health problem despite being avoidable and preventable. In many low- and middle-income countries, the victims of road traffic crashes do not receive care at the scene and may die before reaching hospital. In low- and middle-income countries where prehospital emergency medical services are not well established, bystanders have the potential to save lives by providing first aid. Nepal has rising rates of road traffic injuries and emergency medical services are early in development. There is limited evidence on the factors that influence people in Nepal to become trained in first aid and to use their first aid skills.


To understand the barriers and facilitators to learning first aid and to applying those skills to help road traffic crash victims in Nepal.


Qualitative study using semistructured interviews.


Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kaski and Makwanpur districts in Nepal.


We interviewed three groups of participants: (1) members of the public who had never been trained in first aid, (2) members of the public who had been trained in first aid and (3) first aid trainers.


Interviews explored reasons why people may be interested in being trained and factors that would inhibit being trained or applying their first aid skills. Interviews were transcribed, translated into English and analysed thematically.


Respect from the public, a desire to help those in need and confidence to apply skills were important factors in encouraging people to learn and apply first aid. Barriers included lack of time and financial implications of providing first aid. The fear of social and legal consequences if the patient had a poor outcome, a lack of confidence to apply skills and lack of trust shown to first aiders by some members of the community discouraged learning and using first aid skills.


Participants were mostly from urban and semiurban areas. People with more difficult access to health care may have held different views. People who were untrained in first aid and agreed to participate may hold different views to those who were not recruited, as they had interest in the topic.


Members of the public can be encouraged to learn and apply first aid skills to help road traffic crash victims, but there are multiple barriers to engagement in first aid. Providing legal protection from prosecution for first aiders, raising public awareness of the value of first aid, addressing financial constraints and provision of refresher training may address these barriers.


Research to address the barriers to the creation of a Good Samaritan law appears warranted. The perspectives of other groups often involved in the care and/or transport of road traffic crash victims, such as taxi drivers, would add to our understanding of factors affecting the application of first aid. The gendered stereotypes reported by female first aiders warrant further exploration.

Based on the data of food consumption and forestry production and trade, this study dynamically investigated the consumption levels, structure and ecological consumption patterns of farmland, forest, grassland, water and the integrated ecosystem in Nepal and their main driving forces, using the physical quantity accounting method. The results showed that the total consumption of farmland, forest, grassland, water and the integrated ecosystem in Nepal from 1961 to 2018 exhibited a fluctuating increase, with average value of 7.26 Tg yr–1, 6.38 Tg yr–1, 1.10 Tg yr–1, 0.02 Tg yr–1 and 14.76 Tg yr–1, respectively. The annual per capita forest consumption roughly decreased, while the annual per capita consumption of farmland, grassland, waters and integrated ecosystems mostly increased with their growth rates accelerating. The corresponding ecological consumption patterns were the “Log-Cereal-Milk” mode during 1961–1984, the “Log-Cereal-Vegetable-Root-Milk-Sugar” mode during 1985–2007 and the “Log-Cereal-Vegetable-Root-Sugar-Fruit-Milk” mode during 2008–2018. This study indicated that the supply capacity of the ecosystem (production, import and export capacity) and socio-economic factors (population density, per capita GDP and religious beliefs) are the main driving forces that are restricting the evolution of Nepal's ecological consumption pattern. Although Nepal's dietary structure has improved significantly, there is still a large gap between it and the standard of a balanced diet. The supply capacities of fruits, meat, eggs, milk and aquatic products should be enhanced to meet people's demand for a balanced diet. This study can provide data support for the establishment of China's aid projects to improve Nepal's livelihood.",,,SDG 15: Life on Land
