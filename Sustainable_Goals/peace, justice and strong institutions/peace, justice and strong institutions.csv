Nepal’s Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), negotiated in the presence of United Nations officials and signed in 2006, does not include an amnesty provision but a commitment to accountability for human rights violations and an agreement to end impunity for such crimes. Yet, as this chapter demonstrates, agreement to include anti-impunity measures in the CPA was driven, not by a commitment to end impunity for human rights violations, but by a desire to avoid criticism from the international actors present during the negotiations. This lack of intention to comply with the human rights terms of the CPA was evident in the negotiating process and has been born out in the post-conflict period, with several successive governments attempting to legislate in favour of introducing amnesty laws. At the same time, a lack of capacity within those local institutions committed to ending impunity for human rights violations, exacerbated by the withdrawal of UN support for their processes, has hampered efforts to combat these impunity measures.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/1D3B45385213664F593692D7F77B9764,,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The landslides pose a serious threat to human lives and economic stability, particularly in high-risk areas like the mid-hills and mountain regions of Nepal. Seasonal variations in landslides have been influenced by monsoon activity, while poorly planned and constructed roads exacerbate the issue. The paper aims to highlight the vulnerability of Nepal's geography to landslides through case studies and existing literature. It concludes that landslides result from a complex interplay of geographical, climatic, and anthropogenic elements. To address the situation, the focus should be on sustainable infrastructure development, especially in mid-hills and mountain regions, by considering proper grading and drainage patterns during road construction. This approach can effectively mitigate anthropogenic factors and bring economic benefits to the nation while promoting a safer and more resilient future.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/jsdpj/article/download/58265/43510,,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

But what happens when the transition to democracy generates refugees that are not permitted to return to what appears to now be a stable, peaceful democracy? This is the case of Bhutan, who forcefully expelled its largest minority community during a period of nation building, then successfully transitioned to democracy without any accountability for the crimes that occurred during that process. While approximately 100,000 Bhutanese refugees in camps awaited some measure of justice and hoped for repatriation, the international community provided them with a democratically grounded education to raise awareness of their rights. But this education was not matched by any pathways to exercise those rights or achieve justice. This article examines how particular challenges to transitional justice are experienced by refugee and diaspora communities, and how current justice structures frequently fail to meet their needs.",https://academic.oup.com/ijtj/article-pdf/18/2/267/58964236/ijae009.pdf,,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The amendment, drafted to protect minors from sexual exploitation by adults, resulted in the criminalisation of consensual relationships between adolescents. The surge of inmates aged 16 to 18 years is leading Nepal into a crisis in its juvenile correction centres, with overcrowded facilities, decrepit conditions, and increased violence. This crisis was underlined by three deaths in juvenile correction centres at Bhaktapur, Parsa, and Banke up to September 2023. This article explores the legal, social, and ethical dilemmas generated by Nepal's reforms of rape law and advocates for a more nuanced approach in safeguarding vulnerable populations without moralising normal adolescent sexual conduct.

This chapter revisits the ex-combatants in Nepal from the cantonment stay to the present time, including the time period from 2011 to 2020. The life experience of ex-combatants itself is interesting, as their identity has been transformed drastically, challenging their own assumptions of their role in post-conflict society. This chapter, based on personal experiences and testimonials, explicated past assumptions and the present realities of those ex- combatants.",,,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

But, it needs to produce huge amounts of electricity to support economic activities and growth, though it faces challenges. The paper attempts to fill this gap by studying hydropower development in support of economic growth and overall development, and further discussing its challenges through a literature review analysis and Key Informant Interviews. Economically, Nepal has more than 42000 MW of hydropower generation capacity, but the present generation capacity is 2945 MW, though only below more than 50 percent of the total generation capacity works out in the dry season due to low water discharge and faces a deficiency of electricity. Nepal also imports electricity from India to fulfill domestic demands in the season. There is a gap in the demand and supply lines. Hydropower has become a de-facto reality in light of economic development and the production of hydropower is crucial as Nepal exported electricity of Rs.15.4 billion worth last year. However, this study shows that the prospect of hydropower development is optimistic, though, there are several challenges in terms of priorities of needy projects, investment, environment-forest-land policies, and governance aspects. If pragmatic policy, effective governance, and leadership interventions are adopted on time, challenges can be overcome.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/jsdpj/article/download/63236/47799,,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

This growth in mechanization has taken place despite the general absence of direct government support or promotion. The growth of tractor use in the plains of the Terai zone has transformed agricultural production rather than inducing labor movement out of agriculture. Thus it has raised overall returns to scale in intensification and enabled the cultivation of greater areas by medium smallholders than by resource-poor smallholders. Tractors have also facilitated the intensification of crop production per unit of land among very small farmers, enabling mechanization growth despite the continued decline in farm size, although these farmers may not have benefited as much as medium smallholders.

In the repressive Rana and Panchayat regimes prior to 1990, resistance was passive or just symbolic, and movements were sporadic and localized. However, particularly since 1990, as urbanization and industrialization increased along with the use of chemicals and other substances, some of which are also detrimental to human health, social movements have also been organized to resist the maldistribution of new pollutants and hazardous substances in the society affecting the poor as well as socio-politically and culturally marginalized and oppressed.",,,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

It helps to neutralize oxidative and nitrosative stresses. The nitrosative stresses are harmful to health and antioxidant-enhancing control of such stresses. Objective: The study aims to explore the benefit of dietary antioxidants such as fruits and vegetables that helps to reduce oxidative and nitrosative stress levels. A high level of oxidative and nitrosative stress levels results in non-communicable disease and depression. Methods: Both primary and secondary data are used for the study. Literature related to antioxidant foods is intensively reviewed. Primary data are collected through structured questionnaires with 68 numbers of respondents in Lalitpur metropolitan city, ward 28 in order to know the usage and knowledge of antioxidant practices at the ground level. There were 68 respondents with 88% of females and 12% of males between 20 and 60 years of age. The food frequency questionnaire was used to collect data. Findings & Discussion: Nepal is rich in antioxidant foods, however, only a small population has access to it. Likewise, many people are unaware of its proper consumption or usage. The consumption of fruits in Nepal is poor; only 2.7 and 1.6 in urban and rural respectively weekly based which is poor and below than average. From the food frequency table of primary data, it is shown that the consumption of fruits once a day is only by 9 among 68 respondents which is poor and below average. The finding suggests that dietary antioxidant source fruit intake is used by small numbers and chances of non-communicable diseases may be high.

Further, it enhances easy access to financial institutions in rural where large banking institutions are merely available. However, microfinance in Nepal is facing critical challenges as many fraud cases are emerging. The policy implication is crucial as policymakers should formulate both long-term and short-term policies and implement those policies immediately in microfinance to revive the critical current situation.    ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/jsdpj/article/download/69573/53071,,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Looking at Nepal as a case study, the Article seeks to answer whether transitional justice can succeed in restoring the rule of law in Nepal in the absence of a meaningful criminal justice process. Through a comparative analysis of transitional justice experiences elsewhere, the Article argues that transitional justice cannot succeed in Nepal without a credible and robust criminal justice process that at once delivers justice and accountability for victims of past abuses and also signals a commitment on the part of the State and political elites to the rule of law for the future. In Nepal, transitional justice has thus far failed to move the country closer toward the rule of law and sustainable peace. The culture of impunity that was at the root of the conflict remains firmly in place and continues to act as an impediment to real progress. The political establishment has recently made overtures toward reinvigorating a thus-far unsuccessful transitional justice process that may include criminal accountability measures to address gross human rights abuses committed by both sides during the conflict. This renewed interest presents a critical opportunity to reevaluate the process to date in order to improve its chances for success moving forward. The success of transitional justice in Nepal is critical not merely for its own future, but for its regional value as well, as a potential roadmap for neighboring countries dealing with their own post-conflict transitional justice and impunity issues. To date, South Asia has decidedly little or no “good practice” examples for combating impunity for serious international crimes or mass atrocities through meaningful accountability processes. Nepal is at a pivotal juncture in its own transitional justice journey and still has an opportunity to serve as the long-awaited ‘good practice’ model for the region. Finally, scholarship focusing on Asian transitions, and particularly South Asian transitions, is noticeably sparse. There is remarkably little or no in-depth scholarly literature on post-conflict justice and accountability in South Asia. While the international human rights community has documented extensively the alleged atrocities committed in various contexts in South Asia, systematic scholarly analyses of the successes and failures in addressing these crimes are less available. This Article attempts to begin filling this void.",,,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Under the Act, truth and reconciliation commission will have the mandate to investigate ""gross violation of human rights and crimes against humanity"" committed during the armed conflict between the government of Nepal and the communist party of Nepal (Maoist) from the start of the Maoist insurgency (13 February 1996) to the conclusion of the Comprehensive Peace Accord (21 November 2006).",,,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Policies have attracted substantial private investment in hydropower sector, but it is not geared towards the use of electricity for overall economic development of Nepal and has yet to streamline policy with respect to lean season augmented flow of water for drinking and irrigation purposes within and outside Nepal.

Using a mixed-methods approach, the study combines quantitative data analysis with qualitative insights to evaluate how weaknesses in fiscal management erode public trust in federalism. The findings show that while decentralizing power and resources is a core objective of the federal system, provincial governments remain heavily dependent on federal transfers due to limited internal revenue generation. The study reveals that provinces fall short of meeting public expectations, primarily due to insufficient and poorly managed expenditure capacities, resulting in substantial underperformance. Additionally, the research identifies a significant correlation between increased budget allocation and corruption, highlighting that higher public spending often leads to financial misconduct. This is reflected in unspent budgets and frequent misuse of public funds, which amplify public dissatisfaction with the federal system.

In Nepal, women face injustice and exploitation due to lack of access to resources, particularly land. This chapter, however, illustrates how women's increasing access to land tenure through an initiative called joint land ownership is helping build a just society in Nepal. Sixteen focus group discussions and a family couple survey of 24 with joint land ownership and 14 without were conducted. Policies related to women and land rights were reviewed. Our results reveal that male dominance and patriarchal mindsets are common in Nepal. The society's recognition of women's land rights is minimal, resulting in their exclusion from accessing financial resources, low participation in family decision-making, and the lack of a welcoming atmosphere for women in land-related spaces. Conversely, the introduction of joint land ownership has proven to be a corrective measure to address prevailing injustice in gendered land ownership patterns. The redistribution of land ownership is a step towards gender equality; women are gradually being recognized as land owners, thus enhancing their security and dignity. Land ownership has also improved their access to health and financial services and reduced gender-based violence. Overall, social movements involving all stakeholders working toward joint ownership can improve women's tenure rights and contribute to a more just world.",,,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Pherali engages with sociological and political theories to analyse the emergence and expansion of armed rebellion and discuss implications for peacebuilding and social transformation. He argues that education in Nepal played a complicit role in the conflict, primarily benefitting the traditionally privileged social groups in the society and hence, perpetuating the existing structural inequalities, which were the major causes of the rebellion. Schools, trapped in the middle of the conflict between the Maoists and the security forces, became a significant political space that facilitated critical education, providing intellectual strength to the violent rebellion. Exploring education after the conflict, the author argues that the reconstruction should adopt a ‘conflict-sensitive’ approach to deal with issues concerning educational inequity, social exclusion, and political hegemony of the privileged social groups. The volume provides invaluable insights into post-conflict opportunities and challenges for educational reforms that align with inclusive democracy, social justice and equitable development.</JATS1:p>",,,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Road traffic injuries are a major global public health problem despite being avoidable and preventable. In many low- and middle-income countries, the victims of road traffic crashes do not receive care at the scene and may die before reaching hospital. In low- and middle-income countries where prehospital emergency medical services are not well established, bystanders have the potential to save lives by providing first aid. Nepal has rising rates of road traffic injuries and emergency medical services are early in development. There is limited evidence on the factors that influence people in Nepal to become trained in first aid and to use their first aid skills.


To understand the barriers and facilitators to learning first aid and to applying those skills to help road traffic crash victims in Nepal.


Qualitative study using semistructured interviews.


Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kaski and Makwanpur districts in Nepal.


We interviewed three groups of participants: (1) members of the public who had never been trained in first aid, (2) members of the public who had been trained in first aid and (3) first aid trainers.


Interviews explored reasons why people may be interested in being trained and factors that would inhibit being trained or applying their first aid skills. Interviews were transcribed, translated into English and analysed thematically.


Respect from the public, a desire to help those in need and confidence to apply skills were important factors in encouraging people to learn and apply first aid. Barriers included lack of time and financial implications of providing first aid. The fear of social and legal consequences if the patient had a poor outcome, a lack of confidence to apply skills and lack of trust shown to first aiders by some members of the community discouraged learning and using first aid skills.


Participants were mostly from urban and semiurban areas. People with more difficult access to health care may have held different views. People who were untrained in first aid and agreed to participate may hold different views to those who were not recruited, as they had interest in the topic.


Members of the public can be encouraged to learn and apply first aid skills to help road traffic crash victims, but there are multiple barriers to engagement in first aid. Providing legal protection from prosecution for first aiders, raising public awareness of the value of first aid, addressing financial constraints and provision of refresher training may address these barriers.


Research to address the barriers to the creation of a Good Samaritan law appears warranted. The perspectives of other groups often involved in the care and/or transport of road traffic crash victims, such as taxi drivers, would add to our understanding of factors affecting the application of first aid. The gendered stereotypes reported by female first aiders warrant further exploration.

Demands for peace, democracy, accountability and development, have abounded in the post-conflict context. Although the conflict catalysed major changes in the social and political landscape in Nepal, the transitional justice (TJ) process has remained deeply contentious and fragmented. This book provides an in-depth analysis of transitional justice process in Nepal. Drawing on interviews with a diverse range of stakeholders, including victims, ex-combatants, community members, human rights advocates, journalists and representatives from diplomatic missions, international organisations and the donor community, it reveals the differing viewpoints, knowledge, attitudes and preferences about TJ and other post-conflict issues in Nepal. The author develops an actor typology and an action spectrum, which can be used in Nepal and other post-conflict contexts. The actor typology identifies four main groups of TJ actors—experts, brokers, implementers and victims—and highlights who is making claims and on behalf of whom. The action spectrum, based on contentious politics literature and resistance literature, demonstrates the strategies actors use to shape the TJ process. This book argues that the potential of TJ lies in these dynamics of contention. It is by letting these dynamics play out that different conceptualisations of TJ can arise. While doing so may lead to practical challenges and produce situations that are normatively undesirable for some actors, particularly when certain political parties and national actors seem to 'hijack' TJ, remaining steadfast to the dominant TJ paradigm is also undesirable. As the first book to provide a single case study on TJ in Nepal, it makes theoretical and empirical contributions to: TJ research in Nepal and the Asia-Pacific more broadly, the politics versus justice binary and the concept of victimhood, among others. It will be of interest to a wide range of scholars in the study of transitional justice, peace and conflict studies, human rights, sociology, political science, criminology, law, anthropology and South Asian Studies, as well as policy-makers and NGOs.",,,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"
