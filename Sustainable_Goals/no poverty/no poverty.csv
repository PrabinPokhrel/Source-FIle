We assess how Nepalese PAs influence poverty, extreme poverty, and inequality using a multidimensional poverty index, and a quasi‐experimental design that controls for potential confounding factors in non‐random treatment allocation. We specifically investigate the role of tourism in contributing to PA impacts. Nepali PAs reduced overall poverty and extreme poverty, and crucially, did not exacerbate inequality. Benefits occurred in lowland and highland regions, and were often greater when a larger proportion of the area was protected. Spread of benefits to nearby areas outside PAs was negligible. Furthermore, older PAs performed better than more recently established ones, suggesting the existence of time lags. Although tourism was a key driver of poverty alleviation, PAs also reduced extreme poverty in areas with fewer tourists.",,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:UtQ4nQXygk4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=intitle:poverty+intitle:nepal&hl=en&as_sdt=2007&as_ylo=2015&as_yhi=2024,SDG 1: No Poverty

Using the feasible generalized least squares (GLS) panel method for the period 1996-2021, we find that an increase in external debt contributes to the worsening poverty headcount ratio in the region. Then, enhancing governance while borrowing external funds does improve the poverty level. The regression shows that in West African Countries, governance indicators as well as the composite index of governance and the interaction term (governance composite index* external debt) contribute significantly to the reduction of the poverty rate. Therefore, there is a need for West African governments to be cautious when borrowing external funds and work towards sustainable debt management to prevent negative effects on poverty rates. In addition, the level of good governance should be improved in external debt management and poverty ratio reduction.",,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:0NJhzCBZ170J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=intitle:poverty+intitle:nepal&hl=en&as_sdt=2007&as_ylo=2015&as_yhi=2024,SDG 1: No Poverty

This study uses quantitative only non-experimental, descriptive and exploratory study/survey design applying multi-stage Cluster Random Sampling method. At 5% margin of error and 95% confidence level sample size of 2,660 households from 14 districts (two districts from each of seven provinces) is determined as representative for the study. The study finds that Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index (MPI) for the study population is slightly higher (0.133) than that of national level (0. 127) (NPC, 2018). The rational reason is that the current study was based on PAF households only or economically it is homogeneous population. People living in three different places of residence (urban (0.117) and hill (0.116) found to have better quality of life as compared to corresponding other places (Rural (0.153), Mountain (0.162) and Terai (0.138)). Despite having low human development index (NPC, 2014), provinces No.7 recorded the lowest MPI value (0.084), which is urgently needed to be investigated again. By caste/ethnicity, other categories (e.g., Marwadi, Bangali, Sikh. Jain, Panjawi among others) found lowest poverty level (0.064), followed by Brahmin/Chhetri) (0.069). The highest proportion of headcount ratio (51.5) is noticed in Province No. 2. The gravity of poverty is found high among the Muslim community (44.6).

It focuses on five national elections held from 1991 to 2013. It is based on secondary source of data. The Election Commission of Nepal publishes a report after every election. Data are extracted from the reports published by the Election Commission and analyzed with the help of the software SPSS. This article analyzes only facts regarding the first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system. Such a study is important in order to lead to new affirmative action policies that will enhance gender mainstreaming and effective participation in all leadership and development processes. The findings will also be resourceful to scholars who are working in this field. The findings from this investigation provide evidence that the number of women candidates in national elections seems almost invisible in an overwhelming crowd of men candidates. The number of elected women candidates is very few. Similarly, distribution of women candidates is unequal in geographical regions. Where the human development rate is high the number of women candidates is greater. The roles of political parties of Nepal are not profoundly positive to increase women's candidacy. Likewise, electoral systems are responsible to influence women‟s chances of being elected. FPTP electoral system is not more favorable for women candidates. This article recommends that if a constituency would reserve only for women among three through FPTP then the chances of 33 percent to win the elections by women would be secured. Researcher: A Research Journal of Culture and SocietyVol. 3, No. 3, January 2018, Page: 47-62",,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:XtIZUsS3Po0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=intitle:poverty+intitle:nepal&hl=en&as_sdt=2007&as_ylo=2015&as_yhi=2024,SDG 1: No Poverty

The IA not only has global importance for governance, but also has importance for national and regional governances. Proper governance is needed in developing, monitoring and implementing policies that are needed to meet the three pillars – social, environmental and economic of SD. After the establishment of a global level institution – the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) in 1972 as a result of the Stockholm Conference, and the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) in 1992 following the Rio Earth Summit – many countries have expressed their commitments to develop strong IA within their administrative network to attain the goals of SD. Arguments are that strong IA framework is needed to halt or reverse global environmental degradation. Critics, however, say that there are overlapping and competing claims than collaborating mandates between the UNEP and CSD to meet the goals of SD. Nonetheless, none has undermined the importance of IA to achieve the goals of SD. The importance of IA has increased further after the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002 to attain the goals of SD for the 21st century. However, despite the action oriented approaches of WSSD for global and regional partnerships, many countries have failed to deliver needful changes within their IA. Research scholars question if IA is not well established, how would countries meet the standard of Rio+20 for delivering SD objectives. Reviewing the status of IA from four South Asian countries – Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan – from published literature and government portals and analyzing secondary data, this paper evaluates the strengths and weakness of IA of these countries. These four South Asian countries have expressed their repeated commitments to institutionalize services needed to achieve the goals of SD, however, our analyses of the IA’s performance indicators do not justify their claims. An analysis of four major indicators – Environmental Performance Index (EPI), the Global Competitiveness Index (GPI), Human Development Index (HDI) and Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) – within the framework of SD suggests that all four countries have different levels of social, economic and environmental foundations. However, all countries are competing to attain international conferences, signing and ratifying major multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), and claiming to achieve the goals of SD. Though these countries claim to have designed policies, laws, and administrative organizations to meet the requirements of MEAs, weak performance indicators suggest need for further investigation of IA performances. This investigation will reveal whether repeated commitments in papers, mere participations in various conferences, signing treaties, and creating IA to draw international aids are enough or there are other factors that inhibit countries from achieving the goals of SD.",,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:AkqAHlGwjM0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=intitle:poverty+intitle:nepal&hl=en&as_sdt=2007&as_ylo=2015&as_yhi=2024,SDG 1: No Poverty

Primary data collected in 453 households from three villages of central Nepal are analyzed quantitatively within a sustainable livelihood framework. This study categorized households into five main livelihood strategy groups. The results showed that the majority (61%) of the households diversified their income to non-farm sources. Livelihood diversification to business/enterprise strategies adopted by 16% of the households is the most remunerative strategy followed by commercial farming that includes 13% of the sample and are more relevant to poverty reduction. Land holding, education, agriculture and skill training, access to credit, and proximity to the road and market center are the major influencing factors on the adoption of higher returning livelihood strategies.
