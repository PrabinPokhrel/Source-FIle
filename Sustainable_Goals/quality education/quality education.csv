The policies and practices are carefully crafted to address various aspects of the education system, ensuring that all students can access equitable, thorough, and effective educational opportunities. 
Objectives: This study examines the education policies and practices implemented in Nepal to ensure high-quality education. 
Method: An analytical and descriptive research design has been applied to analyze the data. Data were collected through a comprehensive field survey. Questionnaires were distributed to students, teachers, and guardians, while head teachers were interviewed. Additionally, policy experts and local leaders participated in a focused group discussion. 
Results: The study found a strong correlation between various dimensions of quality education and the overall quality of education. Specifically, motivation, teaching-learning pedagogy, school environment, and training and development were found to be statistically significant in improving the quality of education. However, no significant relationship was found between resources and the quality of education. The regression results also showed similar findings.  
Conclusion: Based on the hypothesis, it can be inferred that there was a positive impact of motivation, teaching-learning pedagogy, school environment, and training and development on the quality of education, even in primary and basic education settings. The study suggests that resources do not have a significant impact on the quality of education in primary and basic education. 
Novelty: The researcher has expected that by implementing education acts, policies, and programs, Nepal's school education will be improved ensuring education quality.",https://nepjol.info/index.php/njmr/article/download/65271/49538,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:fzuuxIMSNpYJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=intitle:education+intitle:nepal&hl=en&as_sdt=2007&as_ylo=2015&as_yhi=2024,SDG 4: Quality Education

Values are a kind of standard principles that are used to judge the worth of an idea or action. They provide the criteria by which we decide whether something is good or bad, right or wrong. Values are taught by the value education of school. In Nepal, there is separate course of value education in basic education (grade 6 to 8). The main aim of this study was to explore the impact of value education in personal behaviour of students. The study was conducted in three districts (Dolkha, Kavre and Chitwan) of Nepal among the 600 students and teachers. The study was based on the quantitative approach. The result shows that the value education had taught basic qualities of life like Honesty, hard work, respect for others, cooperation, compassion, and forgiveness. It has brought the positive change in personal behaviour of students.

Private schools are de facto English medium schools, while public schools have Nepali as a medium of instruction. However, some public schools have adopted English medium instruction, and this trend continues. In recent years, there has been a tendency for students studying in private schools to transfer to English medium public schools. In this scenario, this study explores the perspectives of the students shifting from private to English medium public schools in Nepal. This study, grounded in neoliberal ideology, adopted a phenomenological qualitative research design. Three students were purposively selected. The data were collected through unstructured interviews. The interviews were analyzed using a thematic approach. The results showed that the shift of students to English medium public schools for government-recognized certificates significantly reduced the financial burden on parents. The students found that learning in public schools with diverse learning environments was more meaningful. Both private and English-medium public schools used a dual medium of instruction (English-Nepali), with more English used in private schools. The study suggests that English-medium education in public schools in Nepal has attracted students away from English-medium private schools.",https://www.academia.edu/download/119103513/From_private_to_public_Students_perspectives_on_shifting_to_English_medium_education_in_Nepal.pdf,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:afI3Meu9macJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=intitle:education+intitle:nepal&hl=en&as_sdt=2007&as_ylo=2015&as_yhi=2024,SDG 4: Quality Education

It examines the views of the school principal, teachers, ethnic students and ethnic parents regarding the need and use of EMI along with its classroom practice. Nepal is a multilingual and multilicultural country with diverse geo-biological landscape. However, public schools in Nepal have been adopting English medium instruction as a new linguistic market in education, challenging the mother tongue based multilingual education policy of the government. This paradigm shift from Nepali as a medium of instruction (NMI) to English medium instruction (EMI) has raised controversy in the education system of Nepal. As this study found, there has been a growing demand of parents of EMI seeing English as a linguistic capital in the global socio-economic market and they have taken it as economic investment in education. A noticeable contradiction to the successful introduction of EMI in public school education is the tendency for there to be a gap between EMI policy and classroom practice. Teachers were found to have used bi-/trilingual language policy in the classroom neglecting the spirit of EMI. It seems that EMI public schools in Nepal need clear framework for the effective implementation of the spirit of English medium in the multilingual classroom contexts.",https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED625590.pdf,https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:Ig8pm5kJnTgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=intitle:education+intitle:nepal&hl=en&as_sdt=2007&as_ylo=2015&as_yhi=2024,SDG 4: Quality Education
