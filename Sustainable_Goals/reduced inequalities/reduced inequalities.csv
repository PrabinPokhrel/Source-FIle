Numerous studies worldwide have examined the effects of various factors contributing to antenatal care. However, much less is known about the influence of caste/ ethnicity on women’s health-care utilization in Nepal. Using the nationally representative Nepal Demographic Health Survey (NDHS) Data 2011, a multilevel logistic regression was run with results suggesting that both non-economic (caste/ethnicity) and economic (household wealth) factors influence women’s health-care utilization. First, women who belong to a disadvantaged caste/ethnicity such as the Hill Janajati, Hill and Terai Dalit and Muslims are significantly less likely to make four plus antenatal care visits compared to the advantaged Bahun/Chhetri mothers. Second, mothers who belong to the wealthier category are significantly advantaged in terms of using antenatal care services compared to the poorest category of mothers. Third, contrary to the common assumption, mothers from the advantaged caste/ethnicity (Bahun/Chhetri and Newar) do not always fare better in all aspects of life; when from the poorest households, they are not significantly different in terms of antenatal care compared the poorest mothers who are from a disadvantaged caste/ethnicity. These findings offer evidence against the misassumption that individuals of advantaged caste/ ethnicities are always privileged, suggesting that health policies should take into account the intertwining effects of both caste/ethnicity and economic status in order to improve women’s health and well-being.",,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Here, we report on evidence that interfacing two metal thin films can suppress spin transmission and absorption. We examine spin pumping in spin-source/spacer/spin-sink heterostructures, where the spacer consists of metallic Cu and Cr thin films. The Cu/Cr spacer largely suppresses spin pumping—i.e., neither transmitting nor absorbing a significant amount of spin current—even though Cu or Cr alone transmits a sizable spin current. The antiferromagnetism of Cr is not essential for the suppression of spin pumping, as we observe similar suppression with Cu/V spacers with V as a nonmagnetic analog of Cr. We speculate that diverse combinations of spin-transparent metals may form interfaces that suppress spin pumping, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our work may stimulate a new perspective on spin transport in metallic multilayers.",,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Among them, the flood is one of the natural disasters and that occurred in the Narayani River basin. The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising. In order to effectively manage and prepare for potential flood hazards in the study area, an analysis of the flood risk assessment was conducted by taking into consideration three primary factors: the flood hazard map, flood exposure, and flood vulnerability. The layers of the population, crops, schools, hospitals, and road network were all exposed to flooding, and the factors that determined flood vulnerabilities were literacy, urban area, and agecomposition (less than 14 and more than 65). The higher flood risk area was found in Ward number 1, 3, 4,16,18,26 of Bharatpur metropolitan, Gaindakot municipality ward number 1 and 12, 15 of Madhyabindu Municipality.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/978-1-349-95839-9_1439,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

It uses the Pearson correlation matrix to study the relationship between stock prices ad macroeconomic variables. The results obtained from correlation analysis revealed that market performance of stock prices is found to respond positively to broad money supply and gross domestic product and negatively to the inflation rate as expected.

This is perhaps an unsurprising conclusion, but still worth noting given the current policy debates about development aid around the world, which range from 'close the [World] Bank!' on the one hand to 'triple development aid!' on the other (Verweij and Gyawali 2006). Nepal is strewn with highly expensive development failures that have lined the pockets of Western consultants and companies, as well as less-than-honest domestic decision makers (see Chapters 3, 4 and 10). These include the infamous Arun 3 dam and similarly large hydro projects, often pushed by the World Bank and other aid donors (Chapter 8).

Methods: A descriptive cross sectional study was done among 198 admitted patients from Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital using semi-structured interview schedule. Data entry and analysis was done on IBM SPSS V20. Descriptive statistical measures were employed. Results: This study showed that cancer was seen in advanced age group with no sex wise variations. Majority was married, literate, from rural area, of upper caste and upper lower socioeconomic status. Cancer of lung, rectum and bile duct were more frequent in males in contrary to that of breast, ovary and cervix in females. Malignant neoplasm of digestive organs in males and that of female genital organs in females were the commonest to occur according to ICD-10 classification. Conclusions: Cancer is rapidly emerging non-communicable disease throughout the world.

The main aim of this study is to identify and evaluate the durability characteristics of some sandstones against slaking, freezing-thawing and abrasion. Lithosomes were characterized in the field. The following laboratory tests included measurements of dry density, specific gravity, water absorption, Slake Durability Index (SDI), Sulphate Soundness (SS), and Los Angles Abrasion (LAA). Sandstones from the Lower Siwalik Subgroup (LSS) are massive to cross-stratified, very fine- to medium-grained, and occasionally calcareous, whereas the sandstone from the Middle Siwalik Subgroup (MSS) are mostly cross-stratified to few massive, medium- to coarse-grained with salt-and-pepper appearance, and uncommonly calcareous. Sandstones have four different types of deterioration and had high to extremely high SDI. The majority of the sandstones have displayed similar slaking tendencies. Under the five-cycle SS test, the majority of sandstones from LSS and MSS have experienced low final weight loss (below 10%). However, two from LSS and three from MSS have experienced greater final weight loss. The LAA values range from 29.66% to 99.14%, and except two sandstones from LSS, rest of the samples have exceeded 45% abrasion showing they were incompetent in terms of abrasion test, and are highly susceptible to abrasion. The uniformity factor ranges from 0.21 to 0.44 indicating that all the sandstones were of non-uniform hardness. Correlation among physical parameter and durability indices was weak to moderate probably because of varied nature of sandstones.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/50823/37954,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Using the convenience sampling method, 100 patients were enrolled in the study. Blood samples from the patients were taken for haemoglobin and serum iron studies. Data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 11. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated, with frequency and percentage. Results: Among 100 patients with heart failure, 82 (82%) (74.47-89.53 at 95% Confidence Interval) had anaemia. Mean haemoglobin level of the study population was 10.40±2.73 g/dl. Fifty four (54%) of patients had iron deficiency status irrespective of presence or absence of anaemia. Conclusions: Prevalence of anaemia among patients of heart failure in our study was found to be higher than various other homologous international studies.",https://www.jnma.com.np/jnma/index.php/jnma/article/download/6486/3767,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Nepal’s National Planning Commission (NPC) in 2016 had released a concept paper on smart cities for Nepal, defining smart cities as sustainable, information and technology-based, with high quality services and replicable (NPC 2016). As most Nepali cities still operate with limited infrastructure, services, and amenities, making them smart is a challenging task. However, some elements of a smart city can be incrementally and selectively implemented by the Nepali urban governments. This paper assesses the successes and challenges in some of the smart cities globally, and as an example assesses the pollution reduction and efficiency impact of adopting a bus-rapid transit system in Nepal. It is seen that a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system for the Kathmandu Valley consisting of electrical buses, will drastically reduce air pollution, and improve mobility for the residents. Urban leaders in Nepal can begin to identify such a transit related and other smart elements to be gradually implemented in their cities which will improve efficiency of urban services, enhance quality of life for the urban residents, and promote sustainability of the overall urban system.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJST/article/download/45769/35807,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

With an objective of selecting appropriate variety, sowing time, sowing method, seeding rate, priming techniques and weed management practice for lentil cultivation four different experiments were conducted at Grain Legumes Research Program, Khajura, Banke in two winter seasons of 2017/18 and 2018/19.  The experiment on sowing time was conducted in split-plot design including four lentil varieties and four sowing dates, while the seeding rate experiment was laid out in split-split-plot design with the treatments of two varieties, two sowing methods and four seed rates. Similarly, seed priming and weed management trails were conducted in RCBD with ten treatments. All the experiments were replicated three times. The highest seed yield of lentil was recorded from the early maturing lentil varieties, i.e. PL 4 (934  kg ha–1) and ILL 7979 (864 kg ha–1). Similarly, lentil sowing on October (940 kg ha–1) produced the higher seed yield than sowing on November (682  kg ha–1). Likewise, the highest seed yield of lentil was recorded from the use of seeding rate 60 kg ha–1 (890 kg ha–1), but it was statistically at par with the seeding rates of 40 kg ha–1 (865 kg ha–1) and 50 kg ha–1 (855 kg ha–1). Differently, the seed yield of lentil didn’t differ significantly under line (856 kg ha–1) and broadcasting (847 kg ha–1) methods of sowing. The seed priming with a 250 ppm solution of sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4) produced significantly the highest seed yield (961 kg ha–1) in lentil. Similarly, the highest and statistically similar seed yield of lentil was recorded with the weed management practice of two hand weeding (924 kg ha–1) and the use of Pendimethalin (898 kg ha–1) and Pendimethalin-Quizolofop-ethyl (857 kg ha–1) as a pre-emergence. Thus, the adaptation of appropriate variety, planting time, seeding rate, seed priming technique, sowing method and weed management practices are the major factors of production for getting higher yield of lentil.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/47941/36326,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Among various retainers used, Hawley retainer and ‘invisible’ retainers are the most common. Most of the orthodontists favored permanent retention. It is obvious that the retention procedures are variable and depended largely on personal preferences, and there does not seem to be any consistent pattern in the application of retention methodologies. The  purpose of this study was to survey the retention protocols among orthodontists in Nepal. Materials and Method: The complete lists of the names and addresses of orthodontists in Nepal was obtained from the ODOAN. The questionnaire was sent to them which consisted of multiple-choice questions and short answer, related to background information of the individual orthodontist, retention use in general, the frequency of different types of bonded or removable retainers that are used, the retention protocol, the type of retainer used in specific situation. All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 12.0.1 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA) Result: The survey questionnaires were completed by 90.42% of the 94 orthodontists of Nepal, 58.8% males and 41.2% females with a mean age of 36.7 years. Most of the orthodontists used a clear (vacuum) retainer (80%) in the maxilla and fixed bonded retainer in the mandible. Most of them prefer the use of retainer for a continuous 24 hours except during eating and brushing for 6 months to 1 year (56.5%) and if possible, for 1 to 2 years (28.2%). Conclusion: Majority of Nepalese orthodontists provide vacuum formed retainer on maxillary arch and bonded retainer in mandibular arch.

Materials and methods We analysed Nepal Demographic and Health Survey 2016 data from 6,069 women aged 15–49 years. WHO cut-offs for Body Mass Index categorised as: underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5kg/m2 to 24.9kg/m2) and overweight/ obesity (> = 25.0 kg/m2) were used. We used multinomial logistic regression to explore associations of factors with Body Mass Index and concentration indices to estimate socio-economic inequalities. Results Higher risk of underweight was found in age group 15–19 (RRR 3.08, 95% CI: 2.29–4.15), 20–29 (RRR 1.64, 95% CI: 1.29–2.08) and in lowest (RRR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.03–2.47) and second wealth quintiles (RRR 1.77 (95% CI: 1.18–2.64). Education, occupation, urban/rural residence and food security were not associated with underweight (p>0.05). Lower risk of overweight/obesity was found in age group 15–19 (RRR 0.07, 95% CI: 0.05–0.10), 20–29 (RRR 0.40, 95% CI: 0.32–0.51), in manual occupation (RRR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.46–0.74) and in lower quintiles. Women with primary (RRR 1.91, 95% CI: 1.36–2.67), secondary education (RRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.00, 2.01) were at increased risk of overweight/obesity. Household food security and urban/rural residence were not associated with overweight/obesity (p>0.05). Socioeconomic inequalities were detected, with overweight/obesity strongly concentrated (concentration index: 0.380) amongst the higher quintiles and underweight concentrated (concentration index: -0.052) amongst the poorest. Conclusion Nutrition programmes should target younger and poor women to address undernutrition and higher wealth group women to address overnutrition. Equity based nutrition interventions improving socio-economic status of poor households may benefit undernourished women. Interventions to encourage physical activity as women age and among wealthier women as well as healthy eating for prevention of under- and over-nutrition are needed.",http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216644,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

It is based on the positivist research philosophy and quantitative. This study is based on secondary data, covering 33 data points from 1990 to 2022, which are collected from reports from the World Bank and economic surveys of Nepal. Simple economic tools like descriptive statistics, simple linear regression, Omnibus ANOVA test, multicollinearity test, Durbin-Waston test for autocorrelation, normality test (Shapiro-Wilk), Q-Q plots, residual plots are used in the analysis. Income inequality and political stability are statistically significant in determining poverty, but inflation and economic growth are not statistically significant enough to explain poverty in Nepal. The coefficient for the inflation rate suggests that a one-unit increase in the inflation rate is associated with a 0.2286-unit rise in poverty. However, this result is not statistically significant at 0.05. The coefficient for the Gini Index indicates that a one-unit increase in the Gini Index, which measures income inequality, is associated with a 1.6137 unit increase in poverty, and this relationship is statistically significant (p = 0.025). The coefficient for the political stability index suggests that a one-unit increase in political stability is associated with a 0.4530 unit decrease in poverty, and this relationship is statistically significant (p = 0.001). It is observed that 60.6 percent variation in poverty levels can be explained by income inequality, inflation rate, political stability, and economic growth of Nepal. Policy implications drawn from these findings suggest that addressing income inequality and promoting political stability should be prioritized to alleviate poverty in Nepal. At the same time, careful consideration is needed in assessing the impact of inflation rate and economic growth on poverty levels.",,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

The study conducted 45 households questionnaire survey in total using simple random sampling in ward number six of Chhathar Jorpati rural municipality. The statistical analysis of collected field survey data was preformed through correlation test and standard deviation. The result shows that the socio-economic condition and the livelihood of the vegetable farmers is improving in recent years. Before doing commercial vegetable farming, farmers cultivated potatoes and used to exchange their production with cereal crops to the neighboring villages. Farmers used to cultivate maize in their farmland, but due to the climatic and the topographic condition it took almost nine months (from January to October) for production. Among the total households, 24.4 percent farmers have seven members in their family and the average family size is 6.3. The Chhetri is the dominant ethnic group of the study area. Among educated groups, the majorities have completed secondary level of education. Most of the farmers are (35.5%) holding land size between 16 and 20 Ropani (0.82-0.10ha.). The majorities of the farmers cultivated high valued vegetables i. e., cauliflower, cabbage, tomato, pea, radish, carrot and green leafy vegetables. The average income from vegetable farming is NRs. 250000/household per year. Primarily, farmers use their income to manage foods, clothes, children education and daily-required goods. Further, due to the lack of sufficient human resources, improved seeds and fertilizer, the majorities of the farmers are facing challenges in their vegetable farming. In addition to this, the vegetable farmers are utilizing their capabilities and are devoted to enhance their livelihood through vegetable farming.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/35556/27793,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Women do most of the water collection‐related tasks in the majority of low‐income country's urban areas, as they do in rural areas for drinking, household consumption, kitchen gardening, and farming. However, their voice is rarely heard in water governance. When climate change exacerbates water scarcity, it becomes harder for people to secure water with more pronounced effects on women. Drawing on the narratives of men and women involved in water management practices and also the views of the stakeholders who are part of water resource management in two towns in Nepal, this paper demonstrates emerging forms of gender inequality concerning access to and control over water resources, as well as associated services such as sanitation. We found that women's voice in water governance is systematically excluded, and such gender‐based disadvantage intersects with economic disadvantage as women in low‐income poor urban settlements are experiencing additional difficulty in accessing water and sanitation services. Gender inequity persists in the urban water sector, and of course the wider social structures, despite some progressive policy changes in recent years, such as the 30% quota reserved for women in local‐level water management bodies in Nepal. The paper concludes that tackling gender inequity in water management requires a transformative approach that seriously takes into account women's voice, critical awareness, and open deliberation over the causes and consequences of the current approaches and practices. Moreover, gender‐inclusive outcomes on water management are linked to changes in areas outside of the water sector, such as property ownership structures that constrain or enable women's access to water and related services.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wwp2.12052,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Imminent water crisis due to climate change, water demanding nature of traditionally cultivated rice, increasing scarcity of labor and escalating labor costs drive the search for alternative management methods to increase water productivity, system sustainability and profitability in rice cultivation. Direct seeded rice (DSR) technique has received much attention and popularity nowadays because of its low-input demanding nature that can mitigate emission of green-house gases and adaption to climatic risks. DSR involves sowing of dry seed into a prepared seedbed, pre-germinated seed into a puddled soil surface and standing water. The development of early maturing varieties and use of efficient nutrient management practices along with increased adoption of integrated weed management techniques have encouraged many farmers to switch from transplanted to DSR culture. DSR technology is highly mechanized in some developed countries like USA, Australia, Japan, China, Korea etc. This shift from traditional rice to DSR will substantially reduce crop water requirements, soil organic-matter turnover, enhanced nutrient management, carbon sequestration, weed management, greenhouse-gas emissions and enhance crop intensification. However, weed and nematode infestation, blast, panicle sterility, lack of suitable varieties for DSR and lodging are major challenges. Based on existing evidences, this paper reviews the integrated package of technologies for DSR, potential advantages and challenges associated with it.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44786/33689,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

This study aims to assess the barriers to safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on building construction projects in Nepal. A total of 330 responses were collected from construction professionals in Nepal using a Likert scale. To ensure the data's suitability for factor analysis using Principal Component Analysis, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, Bartlett's Sphericity test, inter-component correlations, and Cronbach alpha scores for internal consistency were checked, and principal components were extracted. A 25-item safety barrier to safety measures in building construction projects during the COVID-19 pandemic was identified through an extensive review of the literature; six components were retained using Principal Component Analysis which represented the model of choice and explained 62.86 % of the data variance. The components were; inappropriate safety guidelines, psychological working pressure, inadequate hygiene monitoring and control, lack of safety awareness, improper working culture, and insufficient planning and scheduling. The internal consistency for the retained components was high; Cronbach α scores ranged from 0.72 to 0.796. “Inappropriate Safety Guidelines” was the most critical barrier to implementing safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in building construction projects, according to the rankings of the six identified components. It is recommended that construction professionals and regulatory bodies prioritize the development and adherence to robust safety protocols tailored to pandemic conditions. Regularly updating and reinforcing these guidelines will be crucial in safeguarding the health and well-being of workers while ensuring project continuity.

The mechanism of the LSL failure process is not well understood due to the different deformation stages controlled by geological structures and causative/ triggering factors. Regional tectonic structures and local rock mass characteristics play a vital role in the formation of LSLs. Engineering geological characterization was performed to evaluate the rock/soil properties, and the associated state of danger (cracks, seepage, etc.). The rock mass rating (RMR) and geological strength index (GSI) methods were used to estimate rock mass quality and strength parameters. The estimated strength parameters together with laboratory test data were used to set up a two-dimensional (2D) landslide surface to simulate the failure scenarios. The simulation of landslide models was iterated under different loading conditions by incorporating geological heterogeneities. The results have demonstrated that the movement of the slope was affected by different stress conditions over time, which were verified using spatiotemporal landslide data. The landslide exhibited a three-stage failure mechanism with the development of tension-induced cracking at the rear and shearing failure of the critical locking section in the middle section. The tension shear and joint-step-path rupture along joint surfaces occurred during different stages of the landslide failure processes. The simulated results showed that the genetic development of LSL is mainly attributed to the geological structures and sudden changes in stress conditions. Thus, the research outcomes can be illustrative to evaluate the role of geological discontinuities, geotechnical parameters and triggering effects by the numerical simulation techniques for the failure mechanism of LSLs.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/57921/43297,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

We used pooled OLS and fixed effect methods. The study finds that singing DTA agreement have had small but positive impact on the inflow of FDI. Specifically, Nepal receives, on average, between 91.90 to 216.54 million more FDI per country per year from countries with DTA agreement compared to countries without such agreement.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/48036/35996,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

How to bring to Nepal the global lessons in achieving better cancer care is uncertain. We need to create an environment of ideas and a powerful vision to meet the needs for better major cancer management for Nepalis.Broadly, the Nepalese challenges are in creating more accessible and affordable care of sufficiently high-quality to make a difference. Hospitals are the major places where these issues have to be considered. To address these challenges, we offer a vision and suggest here strategies of major organizational changes in: Innovative staffing models, emphasizing teamwork, with increases in responsibilities, activities and work force percentages of non-physician health professionals; Increased outpatient care and tele-health; 3.Creating and following evidence-based diagnostic pathway and treatment clinical practice guidelines and checklists; 4. Increased application of information technology tools, particularly electronic medical records; and 5.

Compared to foreign direct investment (FDI) or foreign aid (grants & loans), the money injected to the economy of Nepal through remittances is markedly larger. Huge investment in the real estate sector and large sums of money applied for share subscription indicate the need and opportunities of channelizing remittances in the infrastructure development and productive sector. However, most studies on remittances are focused on the ex-post analysis of the economy and few studies focus on the planning and policy issues aimed to utilize remittances. This paper reviews literature on utilizing remittance money and analyzes the prospects of capitalizing remittances in Nepal. A conceptual model is proposed on utilizing remittance money for infrastructure development. The proposed model of a remittance investment trust aims to synergize the three best attributes of the three domains of stakeholders, namely, abundant remittance money of the people, excellent management skills of the private sector, and the superior public trust to the government. Remittance money can serve as a great investment vehicle for executing properly investigated and attractive infrastructure projects. As estimated for Lumbini province, the remittance investment trust may contribute to fulfill 20% of the deficit of investment towards achieving the sustainable development goals. While the model is proposed for a province, it is expected to be replicable to the national and sub-national governments in Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/55075/42217,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

We specifically investigate the role of tourism in contributing to PA impacts. Nepali PAs reduced overall poverty and extreme poverty, and crucially, did not exacerbate inequality. Benefits occurred in lowland and highland regions, and were often greater when a larger proportion of the area was protected. Spread of benefits to nearby areas outside PAs was negligible. Furthermore, older PAs performed better than more recently established ones, suggesting the existence of time lags.

The aim of this study is to find out the hospital based frequency of neonatal sepsis and characterize the bacteriological profile along with their sensitivity and resistance pattern. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study done in Kanti Children Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal over the period of one year starting from July 2018 to June 2019.All culture positive cases were enrolled in the study and their sensitivity pattern were analyzed. Results were expressed as percentage, mean, P-Value and Odds Ratio. Results: A total of 107 cases were culture positive among 1064 probable sepsis accounting 10.05%. Predominant microorganism isolated in this study were staphylococcus aureus 66(61.7%), Klebsiella spp. 15(14%), Esherichia Coli 7(6.5%) followed by Acinatobacter spp 6(5.6%). Most of the Gram positive organisms were resistant to Ampicillin, Cetazidime, Cefotaxime and sensitive to Gentamicin, Amikacin, Imipenam, Vancomycin, Ofloxacin, and Tigecyclin. Whereas Gram negative organisms are resistant to Cephalexin, Ampicillin, Piperacillin/Tazobactum, Cefotaxime and sensitive to Tigecyclin), Vancomycin Chloramphenicol and Colistin. Conclusion: There was striking similarity in bacteriological profile in both early onset as well as late onset neonatal sepsis. Most of the pathogens were resistant to WHO first line antibiotics Ampicillin and also the resistance is increasing even in 3rd generation Cephalosporin.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JGMCN/article/download/29935/26465,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Fruit bat of Pteropodidae family is the natural reservoir of the virus. Thus, the territorial habitat of these bats is the high risk zone of NiV outbreak. The symptoms are very nonspecific and the pathogenicity of NiV is yet to be fully understood. Diagnosis of NiV infection still relies on molecular techniques. Till date, no drugs or vaccines against NiV has been approved. Some research have presented arrays of the possible treatment and prevention option, but without sure shot implications. So, appropriate precautions are the only currently available prevention option. Nepal is yet to experience a NiV outbreak but that does not undermine the risk posed to the general population.

Phenomenologists concentrate on the structures of consciousness as individuals experienced and expressed while turning an objective world or phenomenon into a subjective one through objectivation, internalization and externalization/ institutionalization process. The structuralist holds that the creation of an institution is a reproduction of interaction between structures and actors. And other theorists (e.g., Leach et al., 1999; Ostrom 2005, 2009; Gupta et al., 2010; Young, 2010) consider that institutions for natural resources conflate with social institutions and mediate their relations. Although these theories are not explicit epistemologically in a pragmatic sense, they have indicated language, rules, (embedded) practices and knowledge are the referential artifacts of institutions. These theories are found applicable in the institutionalization/socialization history of CF as it had gone through the social rejection (i.e, objectivation) during the 1970s, internalization during the 1980s, and socialization of it during and after the 1990s. The socialization of CF after the 1990s was due to the formation of CF as a social space (a ‘structure’ or ‘institution’) to discuss social and environmental issues into one place where forest dependent users (‘actors’) rationalize the use of forest and its conservation for local environment in a more pragmatic sense (i.e., mediate people-nature relations). An institution for natural resources is, therefore, the combined perspectives of phenomenologists, structuralists, and those who think institutions as a mediator of people-nature relations. Thus, an institution is political (i.e., relations and interactions) and ecological/economic (i.e., access to natural resources, livelihood practices).",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/35547/27788,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods study to evaluate gender equality in the mental health research workforce in Nepal. The scoping review assessed gender disparities in authorship of journal publications for Nepal mental health research, using databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, NepJol, NepMed) for 5 years. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 22 Nepali researchers to identify structural barriers limiting women’s leadership. Results: Of 337 articles identified, 61% were by Nepali first authors. Among Nepali first authors, 38.3% were women. Nepali women had half the odds of being first authors compared with men, when referenced against non-Nepali authors (OR 0.50, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.16). When limiting publications to those based on funded research, the odds were worse for first authorship among Nepali women (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.71). The qualitative analysis supported the scoping review and identified a lack of gender-friendly organisational policies, difficulties in communication and mobility, and limited opportunities for networking as barriers to women’s leadership in global health research. Conclusion: Efforts are needed for greater representation of Nepali women in global mental health research, which will require transformative organisational policies to foster female leadership. Those in leadership need to recognise gender inequalities and take necessary steps to address them.

Improper visualization of primary fistulous tract and the associated abscesses or secondary tracts a r e the causes of recurrence. Earlier imaging modalities like conventional fistulography, endosonography and CT scan have had limited role. Even without endorectal coils, 3T MRI has multi-planar imaging capability and excellent soft tissue differentiation to show perianal anatomy, primary and secondary tracts with associated abscesses in relation to sphincter complex. It provides excellent road map to surgeons for preoperative evaluation. The objective of the study was to evaluate the role of 3T MR in imaging of perianal fistulas. Methods: A retrospective study was done among 32 patients who were referred for MR fistulogram for suspected perianal fistula at Jeebanta Advanced Kathmandu Imaging, Durbar Marg, Kathmandu, Nepal. All images and findings were obtained and recorded with the help of Philips Ingenia 3T digital broadband MR scanner. Imaging was performed in oblique coronal and oblique axial plane. MR images were studied and grading system was applied according to the St James’s University Hospital Classification. The data were entered in a performa and was analyzed using IBM SPSS V21. Results: Male to female ratio was 7:1. According to St. James University Hospital MR Imaging classification of perianal fistulas, most of the patients (25%) had Grade 4 followed by (12.5% each) Grade 0, Grade 1 and Grade 2 and (6.3% each) Grade 3 and Grade 5 fistulas. Mean age was 37.28 years (Std. deviation 11.9). Common internal opening in axial image was found at 5 0’ clock positions (31.3%). Mean length of the fistulous tract was 3.9 cm (Std. deviation 2.3). Conclusion: Perianal fistulas are more common in males and Grade 4 fistulas are the commonest. MRI is well-tolerated, painless and non-invasive technique and has multiplanar capabilities with excellent tissue differentiation of pelvic muscle along with sphincter complex.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JSSN/article/download/24552/20658,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

If one looks at the total quantum of water that flows out of Nepal in one year, the above message sounds valid but as the flow of water is not under anybody’s control and flow occurs under gravity as it precipitates or exits the water springs, it should be considered in two dimensions: volume and time. In my opinion, Nepal is water stressed most of the time of year: flood stressed during the monsoon and drought stressed during the rest of the year. Nepal is rich in ice-mass, which is depleting at an alarming rate due to global warming giving rise to formation and increase in volume of glacial lakes that increases the vulnerability and risks to the economic activities along the river basins. Similarly, Nepal is rich ing round water resource with the total annual replenish able reserve of about 12 BCM mostly located in the Terai plains. The most debatable is the surface water that mostly falls as rain during the monsoon and cascades down crossing into India, is often devastating, as it passes. Nepal’s water resource is generally related to its hydropower potential calculated as 83,000MW by Dr. Hari Man Shrestha back in the sixties. Hydropower potential is a number that is based on the energy potential and the market, therefore, it is changing from time to time due to change in demand pattern and the market rates. Myopic view of looking at the Himalayan waters relating it to energy production as the energy production (TAF-June 2018) comprises a meager percentage of total benefit which lies mostly on multiple use of water directed towards the following two aspects: (1)Reduction in the losses of life and property due to floods and unwanted mountain phenomenon, mostly flood related disaster risk reduction, and (2) Flood Water management for converting the curse of floods into assets by way of its multiple uses, both consumptive as well as non-consumptive including food revolution, navigation, fishery, water supply, replenishment of ground water, energy production and recreation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/24569/20671,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Many civil wars exhibit great spatial heterogeneity so very local effects may be obscured. We study Nepal’s civil war that escalated sharply from 2001 to contribute evidence on these local effects. We combine geo-coded data on 15 000 conflict deaths spread over a decade with small-area estimates of poverty and inequality for almost 4000 localities in Nepal. We model the likelihood of a locality being affected by conflict and the intensity of the conflict, in terms of the number of deaths. Higher local poverty rates are negatively related to an increased risk of conflict and deaths, due to a shift in strategy by the rebels to target richer middle class and urban areas for accessing resources to win the war. Local relative wealth inequality is postively associated with the escalation of conflict, suggesting that relative wellbeing affects decisions about rebellion and conflict. Caste polarization also raises conflict risk and deaths, especially where dominant caste groups were more numerous. These support an agnostic view that poverty is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for the escalation of civil conflict. The strategy used by the rebels in Nepal saw the conflict escalate away from poor areas even as conflict was more likely in unequal and caste-polarized areas.",https://academic.oup.com/ooec/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/ooec/odad001/48959201/odad001.pdf,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

For the developing country like Nepal having diverse societal arrangements, land tenure system plays important role in economic, social and political structure. As Nepal is in the process of implementing federalization, assessment of land tenure security shall be one of the instruments for developing new land related policies and assessing the effect of new policies afterward. The objective of this paper is to perform SWOT analysis on the status of land tenure security in Nepal by reviewing the history of the tenure system and current tenure system, studying country reports and research papers and analyzing policies and institutions. The study shows that despite some initiatives by government, NGOs, bilateral agencies and media to improve land tenure security, land tenure insecurity prevails in all areas of the country even in registered lands. It is found that stable  rganization, registration of most of the built-up and cultivated land, advocacy to protect the right of landless has strengthened the land tenure security. However, the tenure rights of socially and economically disadvantaged people and displaced people from disasters have not been properly addressed and those people are at high risk of eviction from the place they are living. The study recommends that land tenure insecurity arising from political, legislative and organizational behavior should be managed by appropriate interventions and policy reforms.

All the data was entered and tabulated using MS-Excel while Analysis of variation and mean separation was done using R-Studio. The effect of number of seedlings hill-1 on yield and most of the yield attributing characters was found to be significant. Two seedlings hill-1 had the greatest plant height (94.78 cm), highest tiller per meter square (358.75), effective tiller per meter square (303.75), panicle length (24.27 cm), and the number of filled grains per panicle (120.43). Grain yield and straw yield (6.57 t/ha and 10.18 t/ha) were also highest at two seedlings per hill. Economic parameters like production cost, gross return, the net return, and B:C ratio varied significantly with the number of seedlings hill-1. The highest production cost (74.36 thousand NRs. ha-1) incurred at five seedlings hill-1 and gross return (177.39 thousand NRs. ha-1), net return (105.67 thousand NRs. ha-1), and B:C ratio (2.47) was highest at two seedlings hill-1.",,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

The Himalayan area by virtue of its complex geologic structure, snow-capped peaks, a variety of natural landscapes, mountain peoples of unique socio-cultural diversities and adaptation mechanisms has attracted outsiders from the past. The favorable government policies and peaceful native people of the Nepal Himalaya have welcomed thousands of tourists, trekkers and researchers to fulfill their various aspirations and interests. However, the country is often blamed for causing the so-called eco-crisis in the region. During the 1970s and 1980s, publishing several books and articles with attractive titles, some mountain experts showed solidarity with those who propounded a hypothetical theory of Himalayan environmental degradation on the basis of the limited samples collected from a few localities. In this context, the present study is an attempt to review the available literatures and case studies in order to evaluate the potentiality of the so called eco-crisis/environmental degradation in the Nepal Himalaya areas.

In the countries of South-East Asia region, Kala-azar occurs mainly in three countries- India, Bangladesh and Nepal. The disease occurs in agricultural villages where houses are frequently constructed with mud walls. Even people residing in endemic areas have poor practices for its prevention. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 150 community people of Katahari Gaupalika, Morang. Simple Random sampling technique was used for the selection of three wards among seven wards, probability proportionate was used for the selection of the population from the ward. The desired sample was selected purposively. Data were collected from face-to-face interview techniques using a structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done by using SPSS 16 version. Results It is found that nearly two-thirds of the respondents (63.3%) had moderate awareness, more than one-fifth (22%) of the respondents had adequate awareness while (14.7%) of the respondents had inadequate awareness of Kala-azar. Similarly, more than half (55.3%) had moderate preventive practice, (25.3%) had inadequate preventive practice and nearly one-fifth (19.3%) had adequate preventive practice. The mean score for awareness and practice was 16.633 and 5.54 respectively. Conclusion The study was conducted to assess the level of awareness of Kala-azar. This concluded moderate awareness of respondents on Kala-azar which suggested that there is still a need to improve the awareness of the respondents particularly on its causative agent, preventive measures and complication. However, to improve their awareness to an adequate level, awareness-raising programs focusing on preventive practice should be conducted",,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Dengue has since then been an endemic disease within the country with all 4 serotypes (DENV-1,DENV-2,DENV-3 and DENV-4) being known to exist and circulate within the region. Based on epidemiological records the DENV-1 and DENV-2 serotypes have traditionally been the most incriminated serovars in terms of national disease burden according to the Epidemiology and the disease control division (EDCD). Since the beginning of January 2022 up until the 28th of September 2022 over 28000 cases of confirmed and suspected cases of dengue fever have been reported to the WHO with a total of 38 deaths being documented across all of Nepal’s provinces. To date the predominant implicated serotype or serotypes have not been identified. The province most adversely affected is the Bagmati province which accounts for 78.2% of the cases and 68.4% of the fatalities noted in Nepal. A further rise in cases has been noted as of the 8th of August 2022. This dengue outbreak is the largest recorded outbreak within the small mountainous regions recent history. The latest data released by the Ministry of health and population of Nepal (11th December 2022), has recorded a total of 54232 cases with the Bagmati province accounting for 42143 thereof and Lumbini province 4984 respectively.

It is said that the people who cannot earn a dollar a day are under the category of poverty. Almost in all countries children are dying of hunger and malnutrition. Mothers cannot do breastfeeding to their children due to not getting sufficient diet for themselves. At work, women get less wages than male persons. There is discrimination in the payment for the same work between male and female workers. Small children are crying out for food to live but they have not got. The children of poor parents see schools from outside the gate but they have not got chance to go into the school premises and go inside the classrooms to take education. Many school-age children are found in the street playing or in different hotels washing pots to get something to eat from their masters. But the masters are not kind enough to satisfy their hunger.

Although documents mention reduced poverty, it has not been in reality and there is an illusion among people about poverty. Taking all these points into consideration, this paper aims to show nature and causes of poverty in Nepal and also shows how people feel inequality and social exclusion in their own communities and country in Nepal.

Long-term comparison (four years) of the plant at Sundhara and the same system comparison of plants at Pokhara and Biratnagar were performed. Long-term analysis of the plant at Sundhara found that the final yield decreased from 2.91 kWh/kWp in 2019 to 2.21 kWh/kWp in 2022.

The average air temperature at Biratnagar (26.7°C) was higher than at Pokhara (13.1°C) while the amount of solar radiation at Biratnagar was just higher by 4%. This led to the reduction of final yield by 9% at Biratnagar than at Pokhara as higher temperatures at Biratnagar caused more reduction in the power output from the solar panels.

One of the outcomes of Nepal’s social transformation is the significant increase in the social inclusion of Dalits at all educational levels. Yet, looking back at a long history of caste discrimination—including the denigrating representations suggesting that the Dalits do not fit into the realms of canonized knowledge—the young Dalit academicians are still struggling to understand and to render universities (as) their space of belonging. At work are diverse constellations of exclusion, but also very noticeable efforts to enable change and to contest the salience of caste in society and especially at the university premises. This contribution analyses the social university spaces as comprised of diverse sites where Dalits’ academic inclusion is negotiated. The narration follows several personal trajectories, mainly by students, but also by recently appointed Dalit academic staff. The aims are (1) to grasp how caste is negotiated within the university realm and how these negotiations are shaping the nature of contemporary universities and (2) to expand our conceptual framework for understanding the ‘university lives’: suggesting that they comprise diverse socio-spatial sites where different kinds of knowledge are negotiated and, in this vein, trying to grasp the nature of studying. Only by bringing the personal navigations through the university spaces with organizational perspectives can we grasp the modalities of exclusion and exclusion in educational processes.",https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/58089893/oso-9780192884756-chapter-9.pdf,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Since the unification of the country in 1768, the rulers have adopted a number of policy measures to develop Nepal as a monolithic state providing protection to one caste group (Khas Arya), one language (Nepali, mother tongue of hill castes), and one religion (Hindu). Migration of the people of the dominant group into the traditional homeland of national minorities (Janajati and Madheshi) is another noteworthy point. This eventually leads to translate cultural diversity into ethnic inequality. Against this background, Nepal has recently observed a rise of ethnicity among the non-dominant groups, each seeking identity-based political space.",https://academic.oup.com/book/chapter-pdf/58098043/oso-9780198872894-chapter-2.pdf,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Developing an efficient transport network functioning in allweather conditions and resilience hydropower is not possible without the construction of tunnels. The experience indicates that the construction cost for tunnels is considerably higher due to insufficient capacity and knowledge base within Nepal and dependency on foreign agencies who have limited knowledge on the Himalayan geological condition.

The author conducted detailed geological studies and mineral exploration in some of the copper and polymetallic prospects and also reviewed the literature related to copper prospects in Nepal. The present research is able to delineate two distinct copper ore mineralization belts extending from west to east and identify the promising sites for copper ore and polymetallic mineralization that could be feasible for mining. The northern mineralization belt lies close to the Main Central Thrust where the mineralization occurs mostly in metamorphic rocks of garnet amphibolite facies in Darchula,Bajhang, Gorkha, Dolakha, Solukhumbu and Ilam districts. The southern mineralization belt in the Lesser Himalaya occurs in low-grade metamorphic rocks of greenschist facies in Dadeldhura, Rukum, Baglung, Myagdi, Tanahun, Dhadhing, Makwanpur, Dolakha, Udaypur, Bhojpur and Ilam districts. Most of these prospects were locally exploited on a small scale by traditional mining before 1951. Almost all mineralization in both belts is related to hydrothermal dissemination, irregular multiple vein type, replacement and cavity fillings and only a few polymetallic mineralizations at the exo-contact zone of granite bodies. The ore minerals were concentrated during the processes of regional metamorphism at the time of Himalayan upheaval.

This study contributes to the literature by empirically analysing the effects of rural road construction on household income and income inequality in Nepal. Using a quasi-experimental design, a difference-in-difference approach is developed and employed to analyse household (n = 177) data before and after road construction. We find that the new road had a significantly positive impact on mean household income of USD 235 (28%). Contrary to expectations, we do not find an increase in income inequality. Compared to the counterfactual site, it appears that the road has rather contributed to decreasing income inequality.

Available data were collected from the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MoAD), Department of Agriculture (DoA) and Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC). Green house gas emission (GHG) was estimated by using IPCC 2006 guidelines. Agricultural activities contribute directly to emissions of greenhouse gases through a variety of processes including the source categories such as enteric fermentation in domestic livestock, livestock manure management, rice cultivation, and agricultural soil management. Diverse traditional agriculture systems, unique diversities in land types and unavailability of required disaggregated data at the national level as defined by the emission factor data base (EFDB) of the IPCC 2006, were the problem encountered while calculating the emission status in this study. Annual methane (CH4) emission from paddy fields ranged from 111.57 to 133.07 Gg over years 2000 to 2010 but it was found lowest ( 111.57 Gg) in the year 2002 and highest (133.07 Gg) in the year2003. In the year 2010, methane emission from paddy cultivation represented about 17.48 % of cumulative methane emission both from livestock sector and paddy fields throughout Nepal. Also, some relevant policies and potential strategies towards mitigation measures of methane gas emission from paddy fields for the future in Nepal are highlighted.Agronomy Journal of Nepal (Agron JN), Vol.4, Page: 142-148, 2016",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/15537/12529,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

This chapter examines whether women and men manage household waste differently at the household level, especially at source segregation, managing recyclable waste (paper and plastic), and composting degradable waste. Using household survey data from the Bharatpur Metropolitan City of Nepal, we find that women are more likely to segregate waste at the source and also manage degradable waste at home better. Still, there is no gender difference in selling plastic and paper waste. In contrast, women are more likely to give paper or plastic waste either to the waste collectors (free) or throw away, suggesting a heterogeneity across gender when it comes to managing household waste. In most cases, women waste managers perform well (segregating at source and composting degradable waste), but they do not seem to do well in all areas of plastic or paper waste management where some sort of sensitization may be helpful.",,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

AMR is a global challenge and underpinned by many complex behavioural drivers including how antimicrobial medicines are sourced and used. Because of this social dynamic, several research groups are using community engagement (CE) approaches to understand AMR at community level. However, most data negate the importance of children in behaviours linked to, and potentially driving AMR. In this study, authors apply secondary analysis methods to 10 transcripts representing the views of 23 adults engaged in an AMR-focused film-making project. By focusing on participants’ reference to children, we reveal that antimicrobial usage and adherence to health providers’ messages can be influenced by the age of the patient. Secondly that children are involved in some of the behaviours which are known to drive antimicrobial resistance such as purchasing over-the-counter antibiotic drugs. Finally, community members discuss that, with careful creation of resources, AMR could be meaningfully presented in educational settings with a view to children acting as agents of change around AMR-driving behaviours. Findings suggest that age-inclusive community engagement projects could be effective in tackling AMR at community level in Nepal and other low resource settings.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-08042-5_16,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Statistical analysis of provincial wise key health outcome data was done using chi-squire test of the goodness of fit to ensure evidence of inequality of the health outcome across the provinces of Nepal. Likewise, to find the causal relationship between women literacy rate (WLR) and institutional delivery rate (ID), contraceptive prevalence among married women (CPMW), child immunization rate (CIR), ANC (Antenatal Care) service receive by women (ANCRW), teenage pregnancy rate (TPR), total fertility rate (TFR) in seven provinces was observed using correlation and regression analysis tool. The result of chi-square test shows that there could be observed inequality in WLR and ID. Likewise, correlation analysis shows that there is positive correlation between WLR and ID, WLR and CPMW, and WLR and ANCRW but there is negative relation between WLR and CIR, WLR and TPR, WLR and TFR. The regression analysis shows that there is significant relationship among the variables WLR and ID, ANCRW, TPR, TFR.

One third of GDP comes from agriculture and there are numerous opportunities in agriculture mainly because of varied agro-climate prevailed in the country. Niche specific commodities that have comparative advantage could be produced in fair quantity to meet the demand of huge market of neighboring India and China as purchasing capacity of people in those countries has improved markedly mainly for quality agriculture commodities. Trade deficit, food insecurity, income generation, poverty reduction, and employment generation could be addressed by turning present status of subsistence agriculture into robust, vibrant and commercial agriculture through technology led agro-industrialization. There are agro-commodities which are imported from India and other countries in huge quantity by the scarce hard currency earned through remittance. Evidence shows that almost 70% of the remittance is spent for agriculture commodities which have high potentiality to produce within the country even after local consumption. Such produce could be exported to other countries to mitigate trade imbalance, enhance export promotion and import reduction and promote graduating Nepal from LDC to DC within the stipulated time frame as proposed a couple of years ago by the government of Nepal. Nepal should come up with functional, pragmatic and implementable agriculture plan and policy to harness huge possibility of agriculture commercialization to meet the consumption demand per se within and outside the country.

Thus, it is crucial to assess inequalities in stunting for designing equity focused interventions that target vulnerable groups with higher burden of stunting. This study measures trends and predictors of socioeconomic inequalities in childhood stunting in Nepal. Data from five rounds (1996–2016) of Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, nationally representative cross-sectional surveys, were used. Levels and trends of absolute and relative disparity in stunting between the poorest and the richest wealth quintiles, and among all quintiles were assessed by calculating absolute and relative difference, concentration curve and index. Average marginal effects of predictors on stunting were calculated using probit regression. The concentration index was subsequently decomposed into contributing factors. Even though stunting consistently declined in all wealth quintiles between 1996 and 2016, reduction was relatively higher among the richer quintiles compared to poorer ones. The absolute difference between the poorest and the richest quintile increased from 24.7 in 1996 (64.5% in poorest – 39.8% in richest) to 32.7 percentage points in 2016 (49.2–16.5%). The relative disparity also increased; the ratio of stunting in the poorest to the richest quintile was 1.6 in 1996 and 3.0 in 2016. The concentration index increased (in absolute value) from − 0.078 in 1996 to − 0.147 in 2016 indicating that stunting was disproportionately concentrated in poorer households and socioeconomic inequalities worsened from 1996 to 2016. Decomposition analysis revealed that in 1996, wealth (61%), caste/ethnicity (12%), mother’s education (12%) and birth order (9%) were the major contributors to observed socioeconomic inequalities in stunting; while in 2016, wealth (72%), mother’s BMI (12%) and birth order (9%) were the major contributors. Despite remarkable improvements in average stunting over the last two decades, substantial socioeconomic inequalities in stunting exists and is determined not only by immediate factors but also by underlying and contextual factors which emphasize the need for coherent actions across different sectors. In addition to reducing inequalities in wealth, nutrition programming should be focused on most disadvantaged subgroups which are prone to both stunting and relative poverty.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12939-019-0944-z.pdf,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

A total of 20 key informant interviews (KII) were also conducted to understand the perception of farm households on commercial vegetable farming. The result shows that around 94% of the total sampled farm households have leasehold farmland that has spread to different settlements of Kirtipur Municipality. Out of total leasehold farmers, 69% have written agreement with the landowner. The result also shows that the farmers cultivate vegetables in an average area of 5.67 ropani (2884.49m2). Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) are the primary vegetable products, whereas cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) and other green leafy vegetables are mostly cultivated as secondary vegetable products. Dug wells are the major sources of irrigation on vegetable farmland. Out of the total sampled farm households, about 42% of farmers are associated with farmers group and 37% have basic training on vegetable farming. Majority of farmers have savings from vegetable production and marketing.

It was found that deeply rooted caste hierarchy and discrimination practices are underlying detrimental factors for the depleted socio-economic, educational, and political status of Dalit in Nepal. The conception of Dalit as a common identity, although contested among Dalit, is only a short-term strategy to unite them against all forms of injustice including caste based discrimination, and to achieve equality.

It has a high prevalence in the population and is associated with high morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Here, we aimed to study the socio-demographic profiles, etiologies of CKD and associated co-morbidities in patients attending a referral hospital. Methods: We conducted a hospital based, descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study among adult patients with CKD attending Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH), Kathmandu. Patients younger than 16 years and renal allograft recipients were excluded from the study. A diagnosis of CKD was established by the treating nephrologist based on KDIGO 2012 clinical practice guideline. Prior informed consent was taken. Data was collected on clinical features, socio-demographic profiles, major co-morbidities, presumed etiology of CKD and hematological and biochemical parameters of the patients. SPSS version 24 (Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the analysis of data. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Institute of Medicine (IOM). Results: A total of 401 patients with CKD were included in the study. The mean age of the patient was 50.92 years (SD=17.98), male to female ratio was 1.8:1. Among these patients, 86% were Hindu, 24.4% were farmers, 57% were from the Hilly region of Nepal, 51% were active smokers, and 51.6% were alcohol consumers. Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) (36.2%; n= 145), diabetes mellitus (31.9%; n= 128) and hypertension (21.7%; n=87) were the three most common identified causes of CKD. Among the biopsy proven CGN patients, IgA nephropathy was the most common cause. In a large proportion of patients (68.3%) cause of CGN was not known. Most of the patients were in CKD stage 5 (27%), and stage 5D (55.8%). Coronary artery disease (CAD) (in 7% patients), heart failure (in 2.7%) and stroke (in 2.2%) were the most common comorbidities. Anemia was prevalent in CKD from stage 3 onwards, the severity increased with increasing stage (p <0.001). Hemodialysis was the predominant mode of renal replacement therapy (RRT) used by 98.2% of CKD 5D patients. Conclusion: Nepalese patients of CKD are younger; males are more affected than females. CGN, diabetes and hypertension are three most common causes of CKD; IgA nephropathy is the most common cause of biopsy proven CGN leading to CKD. Anemia is common from CKD stage 3 onwards.

Similarly, there are different causes of trade disputes between china and the U.S.A.. Its comparative advantage is that it can produce goods for lower costs than other countries. So, recent days, American companies cannot compete with low costs of China. Another reason is the view of President Donald J Trump like 'the trade wars good and easy to win'. In short run, trade wars have a positive impact on trade, but in the long term, it makes slow rate of economic growth, employment and weak the protected domestic industry.

The government has been spending a significant portion of its budget on imports, and it aims to reduce this dependence by increasing domestic production and achieving food security goals. To understand the dynamics of this issue, system dynamics modelling steps were employed. The key variables considered in the model testing were domestic production, imports, per capita consumption, productivity per hectare, and average area expansion rate. The study utilized time series data from 1991 to 2020 and projected the analysis up to 2050 using Stella Architect, a computer-based software program. The findings reveal that both the population and imports have exhibited exponential growth over the years. The model also indicates goal-seeking behaviour, with the government setting targets for yield increment based on available harvest areas. However, the policies implemented thus far have mostly been quick-fix approaches focusing input subsidized programs. According to the model, an increase of 70-100% in rice production will be required by 2050 to meet the growing population's demand. The study presents three policy options for achieving rice self-sufficiency: 1) a 2% annual increase in average area expansion, 2) raising productivity from 3700 kg ha-1 to 5000 kg ha-1 and 3) increasing productivity to 3900 kg ha-1 while reducing per capita rice consumption from 200 kg to 130 kg. The study suggests that adopting the recommended policy implications can help increase rice production in Nepal. Decision-makers should adopt a dynamic approach to the rice production system to address the issue of slow growth and achieve national self-sufficiency and food security goals.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/62168/46954,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

This study examines the impact of natural shocks on the adoption and usage of clean cooking fuels focusing on LPG. Using data from the third wave of the Household Risk and Vulnerability Survey 2018, logistic regression is employed to analyze both the likelihood of LPG adoption and household expenditure on LPG under conditions of natural shocks. The findings reveal that households experiencing natural shocks are 5 percent less on average likely to adopt biogas or LPG. Furthermore, household expenditure on LPG decreases by 4.43 percent relative to cooking fuel expenses particularly for firewood by the households experiencing natural shocks. This reduction highlights a decline in the intensity of clean energy use among households concurrently using LPG and firewood. These results underscore the negative effects of natural shocks on the transition to clean cooking fuels posing challenges to achieving sustainable adoption of clean energy solutions.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/73397/56676,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

It may include the use of threat or force. In some cases, the person cannot give consent to sex because he/she is unconscious or otherwise incapacitated. A person may be raped by a stranger, an acquaintance or date or a family member.Methods: The study was a retrospective and descriptive analysis of cases of sexual assault victims examined by the author in the Forensic Medicine departments at Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj and Gandaki Medical College Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal over a period of four years (2012 to 2016). This includes information regarding the age group of the victim at the time of sexual abuse, relationship of the victim to the perpetrator, genital and extra-genital injuries present over the victim’s body and number of cases attended as an expert witness by the author in various courts of Nepal.Results: In the four years period, a total number of 55 cases were examined as sexual assault cases. It was observed that majority were of the 13 - 15 years of age group (46%) followed by <10 years (20%), 16 - 20 years (16%), >20 years (11%) and 10 - 12 years (7%).

Lockdown is considered to be an effective measure in slowing the spread of coronavirus. The study expects to understand community and healthcare providers’ perspectives on COVID-19 and pandemic responses during and after the lockdown in Nepal. Methods and material: Data were collected through telephone interviews with six representatives of community-based organizations and nine healthcare providers, and the collation of information about COVID-19 from social media, news outlets and government announcements. Data were thematically coded and analyzed according to the themes. Results: Although rapid dissemination of educational information through various social media was found, people reported an information overload on COVID-19 while questioning the authenticity of their sources. Several misbeliefs on the COVID-19 virus are rooted in the Nepalese community. Lockdown for a longer period was deemed an unsustainable preventive measure that directly impacted the income source of daily-wage workers. The fear of contracting coronavirus among healthcare providers at their workplaces was further triggered by the poor working conditions and non-availability of personal protective equipment (PPE).

The next common problem encountered by users is the availability of authentic precise transformation parameter between National geodetic datum and World Geodetic Datum 1984 (WGS84) ; global datum used by global positioning system (GPS). There can exist a considerable difference in the position between local and the global system and the difference could be of several hundred meters.  Based on the availability of data three sets of transformation parameters has been determined. The tests have been carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the transformation parameter in this region. The transformation parameter is recommended to transform the topographical data base of scale 1: 3500 and smaller. The accuracy of the transformation parameters are specified and can be used accordingly.

But inequality, whether horizontal or vertical and objective or perceived, exists even in a democratic society and Nepal is not an exception. The political mission of the Nepali state is to create an equal and inclusive society by eliminating all forms of discrimination and oppression created by the feudal, autocratic, centralized, and unitary state on the ground of origin, race, religion, caste, class, language, gender, and geographical specificities and protect and promote unity in diversity, social solidarity, and cultural harmony. To achieve its mission, the government has introduced various laws/bylaws and pursued various policy measures and development programs, such as social inclusion and affirmative action, as remedies for discrimination and inequality. However, these laws, policies, and programs have not led discriminated and marginalized communities to equality and social justice as they continue to remain discriminated against and unequal. In this paper, I argue that discrimination and inequality in Nepal is a structural problem, for Nepal is a hierarchically stratified society based on caste. In such a caste-based hierarchically stratified society, discrimination, inequality, and injustice cannot be removed easily without the state’s strong intervention with appropriate social measures. In this context, all laws/bylaws, policies, and programs initiated and introduced by the government are to mask the problems of discrimination and inequality and disguise indigenous peoples and marginalized communities. They are part of remedies, not an end-all cure. These partial remedies are neither adequate nor effective and appropriate to address grievances of historically discriminated indigenous and other marginalized communities. As a result, Nepal is still in a state of ethnic conflict. I have substantiated my arguments with empirical evidence (primarily qualitative data), which I have collected from ethnographic field research. I have also used quantitative data from secondary sources which is essential to supplement my qualitative data.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/DSAJ/article/download/50916/38104,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

The research site, with an area of 278.324 km2, consists of parts of the Kaski, Parbat, and Syangja Districts. A Statistical Index Method was used for hazard analysis that produced weights. Positive weight values for each factor class represented a higher hazard and vice versa. An inventory of the study area identified 556 landslides measuring 1.511 km2 indicating a landslide density of 2 per km2 area. Thirteen percent (36.18 km2) of the total experimental area was rated as a very high hazard zone. Similarly, the area occupied by high hazard and moderate hazard zones were 77.66 km2 (28%), and 81.83 km2 (29%) respectively. The validation showed that the method can produce results with of accuracy of 82.8%. This indicated the hazard assessment process is acceptable and replicable. The factor classes having greater influence for higher landslide hazard are: near the streams, near the roads, barren or grassland, land with phyllite bedrocks, land receiving rainfalls greater than 4,000 mm, lands with an elevation range from 1,000 m to 1,500 m, slopes steeper than 30°, and south-facing slope.

Bringing the time series trade data from reliable sources, this study also attempts to highlight import dependency ratio, correlation of population and GDP per capita growth with total import and pin down plausible reasons behind these pictures. The correlation study between import data to population growth and GDP per capita showed a positive correlation with r values 0.71 (p<0.05) and 0.99 (p<0.05), respectively. National supply sides when combine with domestic production mimics aggregate rice demands and these figures show increasing patterns accompanied by growing imports together with import dependency ratio. India alone dominates the rice trade which accounts for more than 90 percent of Nepal’s import in recent years. These noticeable surges in rice imports can be attributed to liberal trade policies of the respective trade partner countries, improvement in incomes, closer proximity, similar languages, and consumer preferences among others. Opening a domestic market for rice cannot be denied theoretically in favor of welfare-improving policy tools, however, it should be carefully considered to protect local farmer’s concerns. Though growth in rice productivity is encouraging over the recent previous years, there is ample potential to increase further by integrated programs combining expansion of spring paddy, inputs, irrigation, and technology. Moreover, attention should be paid toward consumer’s fine rice preferences aligning farmer’s motivations. The introduction of fiscal policy with application of tariff or non-tariff measures at least for a few years can encourage the domestic rice industry. Above policy adjustment can drive Nepal toward its rice self-reliant footing.  ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/44796/33691,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

This paper has adopted text-mining method for information retrieval and knowledge mining and followed step-by-step approach to undertake review of policies. It concludes that National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010 can be a milestone in sectoral adaptation of climate change issue largely because it has provided the national framework for sectoral adaptation to climate change. However, NAPA ignores the importance of structural and institutional reforms needed for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into sectoral agencies.

Institutional and Legislative Systems (ILS) approach has been adopted focusing on three aspects: i) legal and regulatory frameworks, ii) policies and programs, and iii) organizational/institutional set-up. This paper concludes that newly endorsed Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act (2017) can be a milestone in disaster management of Nepal not only because it has replaced about 40 years old Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 but also for the first time, it saw disaster risk management as an process focusing on different stages of disaster management cycles, preparedness, response and rehabilitation and mitigation. The provision of well-structured functional institutional set-up from the centre to local level can have positive outcome in disaster management. However, it overlooks significant aspect, such as the declaration of disaster-prone zones limiting the right of provincial disaster management committee only for recommendation to the Government of Nepal. Most of policies, strategies and legislations focused on some specific disasters such as flood, landslide, earthquake and GLOF/avalanches at national level paying less emphasis to the local level. Even now, most of the policy interventions towards different cycles of disaster risk management have laid emphasis on preparedness and response rather than to rehabilitation and mitigation. The conflicting provisions in Acts such as Water Resource Act (1992) and Building Act (1998) with Local Government Operation Act (2017) have made overlapping of their roles and responsibilities. So, the policy formulation and institutional set-up needs to be complemented by the ability and competence to operationalize the intent of the relevant acts and policies at all levels of government.The Geographical Journal of NepalVol. 11: 1-24, 2018 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/19546/16004,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

As it is evident by the regression result; output is mainly interrelated with the inherent components like labour, capital and material input though road is also notices as positive factor. Liberalization dummy notifies negative impact on output. Improved TFPG at post liberalization phase is realized to those years in which capital is also increased which suggests increment tin capital probably with improved technology is required to increase overall efficiencies. Capital intensity, export incentive and foreign direct investment are found as factors affecting on TFPG. This study under scores the importance of comparative advantage production since there is not coherence on productivity, growth and efficiencies measures.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/35940/28177,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Women in Nepal face several inequalities and violence. The causes are diverse, but most of these results are due to socially assigned lower positioning of women. The hierarchies based on power make women face subordination and violence in Nepal. The study aims to explore participants' understanding and experience to identify the status of inequality for women and how violence emerges as one of its consequences. Furthermore, it explores the causes of sex trafficking as an example of an outcome of inequality and violence. Method: The study formulated separate male and female groups using a purposive sampling method. The study used a multistage focus group discussion, where the same groups met at different intervals. Six focus group discussions, three times each with male and female groups, were conducted in a year. Thirty-six individuals, including sixteen males and twenty females, were involved in the discussions. The study used constructivist grounded theory for the data analysis. Results: The study participants identify that a power play between men and women reinforce inequality and increases the likelihood of violence for women. The findings suggest that the subjugation of women occurs due to practices based on gender differences, constricted life opportunities, and internalization of constructed differences among women. The study identifies that interpersonal and socio-cultural violence can result due to established differences between men and women. Sex trafficking, as an example of the outcome of inequality and violence, occurs due to the disadvantageous position of women compounded by poverty and illiteracy. The study has developed a concept of power-play which is identified as a cause and consequence of women's subordination and violence. This power play is found operative at various levels with social approval for men to use violence and maintain/produce inequality. Conclusion: The theoretical concept of power play shows that there are inequitable power relations between men and women. The male-centric socio-cultural norms and practices have endowed men with privilege, power, and an opportunity to exploit women. This lowers the status of women and the power-play help to produce and sustain inequality. The power-play exposes women to violence and manifests itself as one of the worst expressions used by men.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12889-022-14389-x.pdf,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

There are varieties of works in which children are involved where they should not be; however, this chapter primarily unveils the social reality of child labor use in forest resources collection and its implication on population growth. Using data from Nepal, we provide evidence that child labor in environmental resources collection contributes to a larger family size desire among individuals. Inequality of gender per se is not an independent predictor of individual fertility attitudes. The gender disaggregated analysis suggests that children's participation differentially shapes fertility attitudes among men and women depending upon the types of activities in which children participate. While children's contribution to firewood collection is important among men, their participation in fodder collection is important among women in shaping larger family size.

Many hill villages are situated on or adjacent to unstable slopes and old landslides are reactivated from time to time. The rapidly increasing construction of infrastructure, such as roads, irrigation canals, and dams without due consideration of natural hazards is contributing to triggering of landslides and debris flows. Thus, this paper has explored the cause and characteristics of landslides occurrences and their mitigation practices in Nepal. Topographic, geologic and triggering factors, and human intervention causing landslides are characterised to suggest the suitable mitigation options that can be implemented in the mountain hill-slopes. Among the wide range of slope stabilisation measures which are available to practitioner engineer, the lowering of groundwater level in combination of controlling of surface infiltration (e.g. sealing of tension cracks) of water into landslide are the most cost effective options for mountainous terrain because the rise in pore water pressure is one of the basic cause of landslides during the rainy season. In addition, removing of unstable slope debris, surface drainage, and retaining walls are the useful landslide mitigation measures depending on site conditions, availability of budget, and specific requirements. Various support systems and elements can be crafted for creative solutions of the slope instability problems in Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JNGS/article/download/23138/19639,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Various cases of VAT fraud, massive irregularities in the distribution of relief materials of earthquake victims and the government's failure to control the artificial increase of fuel and basic goods, prices after Madhesh agitation and crisis in Nepal-India trade relation has evidenced that corruption in Nepal has becoming systemic. However, no study is undertaken to estimate the magnitude of corruption. Therefore, along with the promulgation of the Federal Democratic Republic Constitution of Nepal, 2015AD, time has come to conduct a nationwide survey to estimate the magnitude of corruption in Nepalese economy and identify the measures to control it. This study has analyzed the historical trends of corruption and economic growth as well as conceptual and theoretical issues of corruption. The main objective of the study is to analyze the determinants of corruption in Nepal. In order to obtain valid useful data about corruption, academic research has been the main sources of information in this study. The objective of the study has to analyze the trend, extend and explore the determinants of corruption in Nepal. Both inductive and descriptive approach has been adopted for methodology. The corruption data have been taken from Transparency International (TI). ADB and Economic Surveys of Nepal have been taken the data for other variables.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/35945/28100,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Thanju on my article ‘Water Resources of Nepal: Misconception and Reality’ published in The Rising Nepal on January 23 & 24, 2014.The rivers of Nepal possess sufficient hydropower potentiality to enhance the country’s socio-economic development. However, some spurious expert and vested interest group exaggerated the hydro potentiality and distorted the fact of water resources development prospective in Nepal. This has created confusion among the policymakers, politician and multilateral agencies. As a result, hydropower development in Nepal has headed for wrong course, and now the power sector, the vital impetus for socio-economic development is in dire strait. This paper highlights the uniqueness and distinct technical features of Nepalese Power Sector. In this paper important component like Integrated National Power System/Grid (INPS), Power Generation Modality (Hydropower, Thermal/Nuclear Plants and Diesel Plants) are well described and Master Plan, Project Selection, Construction Schedules and Hydropower potentiality of Nepal are discussed in detail. In a severe power and energy crisis situation in the country, power export is not recommended. Nepal needs 3000 MW to reach the level of other south Asian nations. INPS is owned and operated by NEA; therefore NEA also has the responsibility to prepare master plan for power generation, transmission and distribution. But, the Department Electricity Development a regulatory body of Ministry of Energy of is undertaking / carrying out feasibility study without taking care of INPS/country’s power requirement. This has created duplication of work and confusion; as such the Ministry of Energy deviated from its responsibility of preparing sound policy, regulation and monitoring them strictly. The Ministry shouldn’t indulge in feasibility study, construction and operational activities, which come under the responsibility of concerned technical department /authority.

They are essential for the treatment of malocclusion and correction of dentofacial anomalies. Human resource data is required for the planning and implementation of orthodontic service in the country. So the objective of this study was to assess the distribution of Nepali orthodontists according to demographic and professional characteristics. Materials and Method: The study was carried on Nepali orthodontists graduated till December 2020. Demographic details on age, gender, ethnicity, address and professional details on graduation year, university, country, working sector, working district were obtained from the records of Nepal Medical Council and Orthodontic & Dentofacial Orthopedic Association of Nepal, and from the personal communications. The collected data were entered in Microsoft Excel sheet, which was transferred to SPSS Version 20 program for category description. Result: A total of 164 qualified Nepali orthodontists were present as of December 2020. The mean age of the orthodontists was 37.65 (±7.047) years and male to female ratio was 6:4. Among all; 145 were working in Nepal and 80 (48.8%) were working in Kathmandu valley. Among the working orthodontists; 83.4% served in private and 16.6% served in public sector. Orthodontists serve in 24 districts of all seven provinces of Nepal. Conclusion: The number of Nepali orthodontists has increased remarkably after the year 2010.

This study found that community forests contributed 45 percent livelihood income (firewood, leaf litter, and grass, water etc.) to the forest-dependent households, along with service and agriculture income sources. Labor contribution based proportional distribution was used to meet social and economic justice. The poor could get more benefit than the well-off households. Additionally, the study found declining inequality among households after being a member of KCF. Without the income of the community forests, the inequality was 0.99. With the income of the community forests, the inequality sharply dropped at 0.64.

GDP loss at national economy and welfare loss at household level in the world are major costs of natural disasters. The cost that is a burden to households could change on income distribution and household income vertically and horizontally and then their livelihood and welfare. This relationship makes a curiosity of whether natural disaster could change income distribution at the household level in developing countries, where socio-economic vulnerable groups exist so that an alternative policy option can be explored to minimize such bad effects on socio-economic vulnerable groups and their livelihood and welfare. This article measures empirically the income distribution effects of natural disaster at household level based on primary data sets collected through a household survey in Sot Khola (stream) water basin using the Gini coefficient method. As a reference line, inequality and poverty levels are employed. Comprehensive and comparative analytical tools are used for testing the above research question based on two periodic data sets and information. As a result, the water shed areas had higher inequality and poverty level than national inequality line (0.33) before natural disaster. The residents were socio-economically and geographically vulnerable. The natural disaster damaged heavily tangible and nontangible assets, houses, household utensils, documents, dresses, valuable indigenous materials, emotions, and food grains. Thus the vulnerable households lost their assets and food grains in the disaster. Its distribution was acute at higher and lower altitude watershed areas and households than middle areas and households. In general, higher altitude watershed areas and households were more vulnerable than middle and then lower altitude watershed areas and households. Such acuteness of economic loss redistributed their inequality and poverty level in such a way. Thus, the vulnerable population became more vulnerable and the nonvulnerable population with their adaptive capacity became less vulnerable. Thus, the natural disaster has a negative income distribution effect at household level, particularly for vulnerable households with expansion of inequality and poverty.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07360932.2020.1715810,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

It is generally believed that remittances have positive effects on volume of imports. On the contrary, if there is more imports than exports, it may run out trade deficit. It does make negative impact on the exchange rate of the home country. A weaker currency can raise the value of remittances sent back to the country, encouraging migrants to send more money home that influenced in growth of remittance. To analyze the relationship between remittance and imports, the study used annual data for 46 years from 1975 to 2020 A.D.

Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted at the tertiary care center with a diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease from July 2018 to January 2020 by convenient sampling. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Committee (ref no. 55/2018). Data were analyzed by using Statistical package for social sciences version 20. Results: Out of 600 patients, 428 (71.3%) were female. The mean age was 44.24±14.24 years. The isolated mitral valve was affected in 280 (46.6%). Dual involvement of mitral and aortic valve was present in 294 (49%). Only 14 (2.3%) had involvement of isolated aortic valve involvement. Overall, mitral stenosis was the most common abnormality 508 (84.6%) followed by mitral regurgitation 418 (69.6%), aortic regurgitation 320 (53.3%), and aortic stenosis 63 (10.5%). Assessment of the severity of lesions showed that 247 (41.2%) patients had severe mitral stenosis, 119 (19.8%) severe mitral regurgitation, 14 (2.3%) severe aortic stenosis, and 11 (1.8%) severe aortic regurgitation. Majority 493 (82.2%) were treated with medical therapies. Surgical procedures were performed in 51 (8.5%). The use of anticoagulation was in 212 (35.3%) of eligible patients. Conclusions: Mitral valve was affected commonly both in isolation and combination. The majority of patients who were eligible for cardiac interventions were treated medically with suboptimal use of anticoagulation and secondary prophylaxis.",https://www.jnma.com.np/jnma/index.php/jnma/article/download/5405/3268,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

The paper shows that the remittance inflow and economic growth have bidirectional relationship in the long run, but there is no relationship in the short run. Remittance affects the dynamics of other variables like investment, financial development, and investment on human capital which indirectly affect the performance of the economy through these variables. Findings indicate that remittance could promote financial development in the short run. It also shows the possibility of negative shocks in remittance flow could have a permanent negative effect on educational attainment. It concludes that an environment for investment should be created for enhancing the role of remittance on economic growth. Policies promoting flow of remittance through formal channels and financial literacy should be effective tools for channelizing remittance for economic growth.

Cost of human resource, stationery, utility and fixed costs of building and furniture were the components for estimating unit costs. The findings reveal that the unit cost of students was equivalent to U.S. $295, 130 and 143 for primary, lower-secondary, and secondary levels respectively, and an average of U.S. $189 overall.

Overall, the present study highlights the necessity of interventions to promote institutional delivery with greater focus on poor, uneducated, and rural women",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/mrj/article/download/51656/38656,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Common natural disasters in Nepal impacting the livelihoods of the people below poverty are: earthquakes, floods and landslides. The return period of former is longer (+/- 70 years)but catastrophic, e.g. Gorkha-earthquake, while latter ones are recurrent and chaotic. Substantial efforts have been made on disaster risk reductions (DRR) both by the state and non-state organizations. Contributions from sectoral ministries led by the Ministry of Home Affairs are primarily focused to legal provisions, strategies and policies while the departments are mandated to implement sectoral activities through projects and programs. Post Gorkha-earthquake rescue and relief operations demonstrated an exemplary solidarity among national, bilateral and international organizations. Reconstruction works are rather slow and still being continued. Despite substantial DRR efforts, outcomes are not satisfactory to the desired extent, whether it is earthquake or are floods and landslides across the country as per media and public voices reported. This paper aims to analyse some key questions towards effective and sustainable disaster risk management in Nepal against existing challenges and gaps in the backdrop of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) 2015-2030.

Employing the 'Stages of ProgressStages of progress ' methodology, this paper shows that nearly one-third of the total 386 households studied have escaped poverty, while 7 % have fallen into poverty over the last two decades. Foreign labour migration, small business and access to land define the movement of most households out of poverty, whereas loss of land, cultural burdens and health costs are the main factors associated with descent into poverty. This paper suggests two distinct sets of policies for promoting escape from poverty and for preventing descent into poverty. Such policies need to consider the situation of the poor who are unable to pursue labour migration, and the left behind household members, enabling their access to land and creating local employment.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-981-287-420-7_12,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

This paper explores the investment of funds accumulated through the contribution of employees for value creation as a means to enhance financial viability and further assesses the long-term sustainability of such programmes. The study is based on reviewing and analyzing the documents relating to the defined objectives and targets, investment policies, investment portfolio, legal framework for investment, and achievements. The study finds that all three social security institutions (SSIs) end up investing the accumulated funds in fixed deposits in the banking and financial institutions (BFIs.). This is despite the act empowering them to mobilize the accumulated funds in several productive sectors and set competitive investment goals. This indicates that they fail to explore productive avenues for sustainable investment of the accumulated funds, which could contribute to the economic development of the nation. The current challenges in the social security system in Nepal are the increasing number of pensioners and the need for sustainable investment; making it imperative for the Nepalese SSIs to evaluate their investment priority; feasibility and diversify for higher and long-term returns; focusing on areas that contribute to economic growth and development; and generating employment opportunities.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/68022/52144,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

This technique is based on a principle that bones or human body parts correlate positively with the stature. Stature can be estimated from measurements of various body parts such as arm, leg, feet, finger, facial height, nasal height etc. The aim of study was to correlate Stature of Nepalese with Nasal height and estimate Stature from Nasal height.Methods: A cross-sectional study of 214 healthy adults comprising 110 males and 104 females in the age group of 25 to 35 years were carried out. Study was carried out in central Nepal where people from various parts of Nepal are migrated. Total body height and Nasal height were recorded with stadiometer and sliding caliper respectively.Results: The mean of total body height in the male and female was 160.4 (±6.80) cm and 151.8 (±4.88) cm respectively. The mean of nasal height in the male and female was 4.6 (±0.31) cm and 4.3 (±0.29) cm respectively.

Methods It was a cross-sectional study conducted among healthcare workers from various health institutions located in Chitwan district of Nepal. A self-reported questionnaire was circulated online. Bivariate analyses were done using Spearman’s correlation coefficient, Pearson’s chi square test, and student’s t test as appropriate, whereas multivariate analyses were done using linear regression models. Results A total of 353 responses were analyzed, out of which 47% were nurses, 28.9% were doctors, 11.6% were health assistants, 2% were certified medical assistants, and the remaining 10.5% were categorized as others. The majorities were females (58.9%), were in the age group of 16–29 years (67.1%) and had work experience of less than 5 years (62%). The majority of healthcare workers obtained good to moderate knowledge and practice scores (n = 82.15%, 83.57%, respectively) and had positive attitude scores (n = 90.93%).

The adoption of rain water harvesting was mostly driven by trainings that farmers received while controlling for age, poverty status and off-farm income. The adoption of RWH technology more than doubles household agricultural and livestock income. Instrumental variable approach was used to check the robustness of the findings. Adopters benefited from an increased supply of irrigation water, which allows them to diversify their crops from cereal production to high-value crops during dry season. Given the many weather-related uncertainties faced by rainfed farmers in Nepal, rain water harvesting is potentially a very useful climate adaptation strategy.

Based on a rich case study of more than 90% of households across seven villages in the Manaslu Conservation Area, the article analyses local-level inequalities in participation and benefits from tourism development in one of the world's most remote peripheries—the high Himalayas of Nepal. The analysis documents that distance to the trekking trail running through the area significantly determines engagement in the tourism sector and that, among participating households, the wealthier obtain significantly more tourism income. These local-level findings show how development initiatives intended to engender a more equal distribution of tourism income at a regional scale may end up increasing income inequalities at a local scale. Interpreting these findings though the notion of frontier tourism development as a particular kind of commodity frontier, the article highlights challenges to market-oriented inclusive tourism development in the face of composite rural economies and rapidly changing livelihood conditions. It documents bubble-like barriers to trickle-down and backward linkages at the frontiers of tourism development; illustrates the need for broader analytical alternatives to dominant value chain approaches; and encourages a more robust integration between studies of rural tourism and the wider political economy perspectives of critical agrarian studies.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09669582.2023.2174129,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Understanding the genetic variability of MAP, strains are important in diagnosis, epidemiological investigation, and therefore the formation of strategies for prevention and control of the disease. Thus, this study was designed to grasp the molecular characterization of MAP isolates of Nepal, as pioneer research of this area. Total of 46 MAP isolates obtained from cattle population of three different locations of dairy pocket areas of Chitwan, Nepal were typed using IS1311 polymerase chain reaction-restriction endonuclease analysis (PCR-REA) to research the MAP genotype of Nepal. The extracted DNA samples (n=46) were analyzed for the presence of MAP specific sequences (IS900) using PCR and DNA samples were further subjected to genotype differentiation using IS1311 PCR-REA and IS1311 L2 PCR-REA methods. All the DNA samples were positive for the entire three MAP specific sequences based PCRs. This study revealed that ‘Bison type’ strain is the single most prevalent MAP genotype circulating within the domestic cattle population of Nepal. IS1311 PCR-REA showed that MAP DNA samples of Nepal origin belonged to ‘Bison type’, whereas, IS1311 L2 PCR-REA method showed similarity with ""Indian Bison type"" and different restriction profiles of ‘Bison type’ genotype as compared to non-Indian strains.

Among them, the flood is one of the natural disasters and that occurred in the Narayani River basin. The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising. In order to effectively manage and prepare for potential flood hazards in the study area, an analysis of the flood risk assessment was conducted by taking into consideration three primary factors: the flood hazard map, flood exposure, and flood vulnerability. The layers of the population, crops, schools, hospitals, and road network were all exposed to flooding, and the factors that determined flood vulnerabilities were literacy, urban area, and agecomposition (less than 14 and more than 65). The higher flood risk area was found in Ward number 1, 3, 4,16,18,26 of Bharatpur metropolitan, Gaindakot municipality ward number 1 and 12, 15 of Madhyabindu Municipality.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-74923-1_822,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

About 56% of the households receive remittances, the country also has high rates of undernutrition as 36% of children under five years of age are stunted. Remittance are known to increase household income, potentially contributing to improvements in health and nutrition of children, but few studies have examined it in the Nepalese context. Methods: We used data of 2,498 children under 5 years of age from the Nepal Living Standard Survey 2010/11 to investigate associations between childhood stunting and household remittances. Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of child stunting by remittances received by the families in the 12 months preceding the survey. Guided by a conceptual framework, the model was adjusted for variables representing child, maternal and household level characteristics. Results: Our investigation showed that the odds of a child being stunted decreased with increased levels of remittance received by households, 67% (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.67) lower for households receiving more than Nrs.60,000 remittance per year. However, there was no difference in the risk of stunting by gender of the household head and income categories.Conclusions: An increased household income could potentially reduce the burden of chronic undernutrition in poor families in Nepal, which in turn paves a path for the expansion of cash transfer programs.

Design/methodology/approach: – Using large household survey data sets the authors calculate income-related inequality in education and decompose the inequality into factors that determine educational attainment. The decomposition procedure establishes the role played by two sets of factors: elasticities of education demand with respect to its determinants; and inequalities in those determinants. The paper then proposes a new mechanism to quantify the effects of policy simulations regarding income, urbanization, and distance to school on education inequality. Findings: – Both the countries show significant inequality in education. Educational attainment in Albania and Nepal is determined by socioeconomic, demographic and geographic factors of which three are particularly significant in affecting inequality – income, urbanization and distance to school. Research limitations/implications: – While schooling for most individuals is largely financed by public subsidy in the countries, attainment is also likely affected by the price of education services and cost of health care. Identification of those factors in the context of more comprehensive data will enable researchers in future to draw firmer conclusions. Practical implications: – The proposed method can help to identify cost-effective and sustainable policies to reduce socioeconomic inequality in education in developing countries. Social implications: – Reduction in education inequality can lead to higher income and better health which are instrumental in uplifting the poor in developing countries. Originality/value: – This is the first paper to measure education inequality using a concentration index and to propose a new mechanism to show the effect of simulated policies on education inequality.",https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JES-09-2014-0156/full/html,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

The findings suggested a gradual increase in the yield with increasing levels of phosphorus with the highest gross return from 60 Kg ha-1 phosphorus. However, since the variation in grain yield among the treatments was not significant, the cost involved with the 60 Kg ha-1 was greater as compared to 40 Kg ha-1 phosphorus, greater benefit was observed with the latter.

The study was conducted in Madhesh Province Siwalik to assess the LULC change over three time periods and to quantify the change in ecosystem services value (ESV) due to LULC change. Remote sensing, Google Earth Engine and Arc GIS were used to prepare the land cover map. In 2000, 2010 and 2020 total area covered by the forest was 68.46%, 65.58% and 71.17%, agriculture was 16.50%, 18.21% and 16.21% and waterbodies were 4.40%, 3.89% and 3.79% respectively. From 2000-2010 forest and waterbodies decreased by 3.87%, and 0.54% respectively whereas agriculture and other land increased by 1.7% and 2.71% respectively. Similarly, from 2010 to 2020, agriculture, water bodies, and other land decreased by 1.99%, 0.10%, and 4.48% whereas forests increased by 6.58% respectively. The overall accuracy of the map is 90%, 89% and 88% for the years 2000, 2010 and 2020. The ESV was estimated using the value transfer method, which was 28 million USD/year, 26.84 million USD/year, and 28.97 million USD/year in 2000, 2010 and 2020, which showed that the total ESV has decreased by 1.16 and increased by 2.12 million USD from 2000-2020. An elasticity indicator shows 1% of land conversion in Siwalik resulted in 0.47 % and 0.21 % changes in ESVs during the two periods, respectively. Overall findings of this study, suggest that ESV has increased in the Siwalik region of Madhesh province in the last two decades, primarily due to an increase in forest cover.

It is estimated as pregnancy related maternal mortality ratio (PRMR) in Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). However, 2011 National Population and Household Census (NPHC) gave a very high estimate of this indicator and challenged the 1996 and 2006 NDHS estimates. This warrants the evaluation of these estimates using another reliable source and this study aims to fill that gap. Method: The 2003 Nepal World Health Survey (WHS) data files were used to get PRMR for 1995-2002. SPSS syntax was used to create sibling history to compute PRMR for the country. Standard error was computed to get 95% confidence interval (CI) and compare it with NDHS and NPHC estimates.  Result: Data quality of sibling history was found to be reliable for getting maternal mortality estimates as age and age at death data was good. Adjusted PRMR of 285 was obtained for 1996-2002 with 95% CI of 161-391. This CI overlapped for 2006 NDHS estimate but it did not overlap the 1996 NDHS and 2011 NPHC estimates.  Conclusion: PRMR from 2003 Nepal WHS were found to be consistent with 1996 and 2006 NDHS as per reported confidence intervals but it was not consistent with the 2011 NPHC estimate. As NPHC used indirect method due to poor data quality of observed deaths and live births, it cannot be considered as a reliable estimate of PRMR. Thus, it is recommended to use surveillance based methods to get valid and reliable estimate of PRMR and MMR for Nepal.

Using the time series data of 48 years of the study period from 1975 to 2022, Engle-Granger’s co-integration and error correction models are used to examine the fiscal effects on the trade deficit, and the ARDL model is used to examine the effects on current account deficit. The basic variables used in the analysis are government expenditure to GDP ratio, budget deficit to GDP ratio, trade deficit to GDP ratio, broad money supply to GDP ratio, trade openness, real exchange rate, and real per-capita Indian GDP. Data are taken from the Ministry of Finance, Nepal Rastra Bank, and World Development Indicators. The findings show that the government expenditure to GDP ratio and trade openness positively affect the trade deficit as domestic factors, while real per-capita Indian GDP positively affects the trade deficit as an external factor. Also, the budget deficit to GDP ratio has a positive effect, while the broad money supply to GDP ratio has a negative effect on the current account deficit as domestic factors. The real exchange rate is negatively and real Indian per-capita GDP are positively driving the Nepal’s current account deficit as external factors. This study identifies the real exchange rate with Indian rupees, Indian real per-capita GDP, and financial development as novel explanatory variables of current account deficit and therefore provides additional evidence on external deficit in the context of Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/68023/52145,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

The wide and increasing availability of census and socio-economic data, tools like GIS with an ease to use and advances in methodology has allowed increasing and refined GIS mapping of census variables. However, it is less emphasized that the result of analysis and presentation is always dependent on the unit of analysis. Data aggregation, choice of data classification method and spatial scale all have effect on mapping result. When administrative boundaries are restructured, it necessitates the aggregation of census data of one administrative level to another. In this context, the current paper explores the scale and zoning effect (changing boundary, changing number of units and data aggregation) on mapping census data. It explores the effect of four data classification methods at two spatial scales. Secondary data sources like local administrative boundary of Bajhang district and economically active population in agriculture is selected as representative census variable for mapping. GIS tool is applied for data mapping and analysis. The study found the higher calculated correlation value (0.88) for the restructured spatial units. The distribution of number of spatial units varied significantly between four data classification methods while plotted against the old boundary but there was not much variation in case of newly restructured boundary. The study found that zoning particularly, from smaller to larger units has blurred the spatial pattern visualization leading to a loss of the preferential information. The study concludes that the restructuring of administrative boundaries into larger unit has simplified the detail for spatial representation and has introduced additional generalization. For policy level analysis, use of data available at one level of the spatial unit when aggregated to higher level should be analyzed carefully using different data classification methods and visualization tools because scaled spatial representation matters in planning and policy aspect. It is meaningful to analyze data at different spatial scale to visualize and identify spatial variation.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23413/19842,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Similar to this, just 34% of women in the lowest wealth quintile give birth in a medical facility compared to 90% of women in the richest group. As a result of this imbalance, the poor in emerging nations suffer since those who are better off can make greater use of the healthcare than those who are less fortunate. This study sought to examine the inequality in MCH services provided in Nepal and to break down the contributions made by the various socioeconomic factors in the years 2011 and 2016. Methods: Inequality in MCH services was estimated using concentration curves and their corresponding indices. We examined the inequality across three MCH service outcomes: less than 4 ANC visits, no baby postnatal checkups within 2months of delivery and no advised SBA delivery and decomposed them across observed characteristics of the women aged between 15 and 49. Furthermore, Oaxaca-blinder decomposition approach was used to measure and decompose the inequality differential between two time periods. Results: Inequality in MCH services was prevalent for all 3 outcomes in 2011 and 2016, respectively.

Utilizing a descriptive research methodology, data was gathered through close-ended and open-ended questionnaires, case studies, and field observations across various impacted communities. Secondary data sources included existing literature on landless housing reconstruction and community-based initiatives. The findings reveal that the landless communities suffered greatly due to seismically vulnerable structures, lack of preparedness, and insufficient use of critical seismic features. These communities often lack access to vital information that could mitigate disaster risks. The study further explores how residents have innovatively rebuilt their homes by integrating safety measures, utilizing salvaged materials, and combining traditional knowledge with scientifically validated techniques.

Between 2000 and 2015, MMEIG estimates showed a reduction of 53%. The MMR is targeted to be reduced to at least to 70 by 2030. This implies a reduction of 73%, which is considerably higher than the reduction recorded during the earlier (2000-2015) period (which was 53%), or annualized rate of decline of 8.7% v 5.0%.

Despite development in the level of health education expertise in human resources and institutional obstetric care in our country, the delay in early recognition of the problem, transportation to proper health facility and getting proper expert care are major hurdles to reduce complications. Therefore we decided to study feto-maternal outcomes in our setting.Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional hospital based study carried out in Nobel Medical College, Biratnagar, from 17th June 2014 to 16th June 2015. Details and data obtained from Medical Record Section were analysed. All patients with eclampsia were included and fetomaternal outcomes measured in terms of complications. Simple descriptive statistical method was applied for analysis.Results: Among 8,066 deliveries, 112 had eclampsia with incidence of 13.8/1000 deliveries. Majority (41%) were of <19 years of age. Above 90% were unbooked. Aoubt 63.4% were primiparas and 83% had antepartum eclampsia. Eclamptic fits were more common (41.6%) in 37-40 weeks period of gestation. Fits to delivery interval was more than six hours in 89.1% women and 69.3% women underwent caesarean delivery. About 18.9% women developed eclampsia related complications. Common causes of maternal deaths (5.36%) were pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, cerebrovascular accidents and HELLP syndrome. Perinatal death was nine percent.Conclusions: Although the obstetric care facilities are improving with time, the feto-maternal outcomes are still poor in our country. Therefore early recognition and proper management are vital to tackle this challenge. Keywords: eclampsia; fetomaternal outcomes; retrospective analysis. | PubMed",https://www.jnma.com.np/jnma/index.php/jnma/article/download/2812/2347,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Earthquake is a natural event which occurs without early warning signs. Computer based earthquake scenarios are used worldwide to describe and estimate the damage from potential earthquakes. The current study is an attempt to explore potential risk with respect to physical infrastructure and assess modeled and actual physical damage and human loss caused by different earthquake scenario and actual 2015 earthquake event in Thecho of Kathmandu valley. The earthquake scenario is based on two nearest fault lines. Risk Assessment Tools for the Diagnosis of Urban Seismic Risk (RADIUS) method has been applied for estimation of potential building damage and casualties..The research has adopted integrated approach using secondary and primary data sources such as field observation, key informant survey and building survey through purposive random sampling.The study found that potential building damage estimated by RADIUS for Gorkha 2015 earthquake scenario and North-west (Khokana) are lower than the actual post-earthquake assessment whereas North earthquake scenario resulted higher loss. Actual damage caused by 2015 earthquake compared to modeled damage from RADIUS is found higher because additional damaged were made by successive aftershocks. Spatial distribution of potential building damage for earthquake scenarios and actual 2015 earthquake event is also variable. North-Nuwakot Earthquake Scenario resulted more hazardous than the North-Khokana scenario though the location of epicenter is relatively farther with high intensity. The study concluded that though earthquake occurrence and disaster is still less predictable risk assessment tools like RADIUS and mitigation measures based on such is important for reducing risk of earthquake disaster.The Geographical Journal of NepalVol. 11: 127-136, 2018",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/19553/16011,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Most of the officials are responsible for managing program and people rather than leading. Staff inspiration, motivation and encouragement, being one of the most important aspects of leadership, has been ignored in job description. District level officials are specifically assigned to manage programs and staff. As the position increases, the extent of practicing leadership increases and management decreases. Public health administrators have more leadership role as compared to public health officers; however, the proportion of management outweighs the leadership. Regional Directors have more leadership roles than other officials do. Conclusions: Role of public health officials vary from being a manager to a leader. Junior officials are predominantly the managers, mid-level officials are leadership-oriented managers, and top-level officials are leaders having managerial roles . In revising the job description (e.g., for the federal context), emphasis should be given to remove job duplication and role conflict, and should ensure role clarity, functions’ precision and output.

Considering the municipalities as urban areas, urban population has reached more than sixty percent of Nepal’s total population. But the urban areas still have rural characteristics and insufficient infrastructures. Due to the increasing urbanization, the maintenance of sufficient open spaces, greeneries and the preservation of agricultural lands has become important urban issues in Nepal. The loss of productive lands has resulted in decrease of food self-sufficiency and green spaces in the cities. To tackle this urban issue, the Fourteenth National Development Plan has emphasized the concept of Food Green City (FGC) by integrating urban agriculture into urban planning. This paper aims to elaborate the concept of FGC and explore necessary policy intervention to realize the concept of FGC in practice based on the study of Godawari Municipality of Nepal.

The present study aims to find the relationship between gross motor function and nutritional status in these children by comparing the proportion of stunting, wasting and under-weight between the various levels of gross motor function. Methods: Our study was across- sectional study conducted on 82 cases of cerebral palsy between one to five years of age visiting Kanti Children’s Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from May 2017 to September 2018. Their level of gross motor function was ascertained by applying the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and anthropometry was done using standard methods. On the basis of their motor function, the children were divided into two categories: those with poorer motor function who had poor self-mobility even with assistance (GMFCS level 4 and 5) and those with better motor function who had self-mobility with various degrees of assistance (GMFCS level 1, 2 and 3). Wasting, stunting and under-weight were compared between the two categories and odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was estimated for malnutrition. Results: The children belonging to poorer motor function were more likely to be underweight (Odds ratio 3.41; CI 1.36-8.52; p-value 0.008) and stunted (Odds ratio 3.9; CI 1.47-10.53; p-value 0.048) than those with better motor function.

The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising. In order to effectively manage and prepare for potential flood hazards in the study area, an analysis of the flood risk assessment was conducted by taking into consideration three primary factors: the flood hazard map, flood exposure, and flood vulnerability. The layers of the population, crops, schools, hospitals, and road network were all exposed to flooding, and the factors that determined flood vulnerabilities were literacy, urban area, and agecomposition (less than 14 and more than 65).

This is the first issue of volume 25 of JSSN. I take this opportunity to thank all the stakeholders of the JSSN and especially the founder of the JSSN.   A journal is a tool for publishing research and it is important to ensure that the research can be used by the community. They are important tools to disseminate scientific knowledge, improve the quality of research, identify new trends and provide a platform for published authors to showcase their work. Realizing this and with limited resources and experience in publishing, back in 1998 Prof. K. D. Joshi and his team published the first issue of the Journal of Society of Surgeons of Nepal. Because of their initiation, dedication and hard work, today we are here with this 25th volume to you.   The journal is an essential part of the scientific community, and it is essential for the advancement of knowledge. It is an important step in getting published, but publishing a journal is challenging especially in developing countries. Developing countries face unique challenges as compared to developed ones. The challenges of publishing in developing countries include lack of funds and limited resources, low quality of submissions, lack of qualified reviewers and editors, lack of publishers' support, low standards of proofreading etc. Scientific journals have become expensive to produce and there is little or no financial support available for their production. The costs include printing, distribution costs, website hosting and maintenance costs. While the whole of the editorial team are volunteers and some even have to spend out of their pocket for the journal. That’s the reason why there are not enough qualified volunteers for the editorial job in the journal. Most of the burden of work is on one or two persons. The most significant challenge is to get the right kind of peer review as peer review is also a volunteer task. Many authors who send the articles to the journal want early publication. But they don't have time to review articles for the same journal.   We while publishing JSSN face similar challenges. We are thankful to those who spent and are spending time and money on this novel task. This includes all past chief editors, editors, peer reviewers and technical staff.   Despite the challenges, JSSN is moving on to maintain national and international standards. We developed our online platform for article submission, processing and publication in 2014. Now all the new issues after that and most of the previous issues are available online. We received two stars (out of three) in the journal publishing practices and standards (JPPS) framework (https://www.journalquality.info)  in 2020 AD and working on getting three stars. We were able to get indexed in a reputed and prominent Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ, doag.org) in 2021.   Meeting the international standards and getting an index on a different platform is difficult because of a lack of funds and dedicated manpower for the journal. It also requires specific stringent criteria which need subscriptions to service and payment per article or yearly basis which is a burden for publishing societies. Publishing societies should support the journal to go ahead and be of international standard with additional cost if required.   The scientific community needs access to quality peer-reviewed journals that are accessible to researchers from developing countries. To reach this goal, we must invest more resources into supporting the journals and ensuring that they are sustainable. Journal is the face of a professional society like ours and is also one of the most important activities of society.  We are thankful to the Society of Surgeons of Nepal for the support which we have received till now. We hope JSSN will get more support and encouragement in future for the improvement of the quality of the journal and meeting ever-increasing international criteria of journal standards. Once again, we would like to thank all our readers, authors, peer reviewers, present and past editors and technical team for their support.

Despite some progress, deeply rooted cultural practices continue to influence policy-making and implementation, especially regarding gender issues. These traditional customs persistently shape childbirth practices, educational opportunities, and basic rights, perpetuating gender discrimination. This study examines how entrenched cultural norms both support and hinder the advancement of gender equality in Nepal. Focusing on the interaction between cultural traditions and gender-related policies, the research explores how these customs affect birthing practices and healthcare policies. It also analyzes the cultural norms that dictate educational expectations for women and girls and evaluates the broader implications for gender rights. The study highlights how ritualistic childbirth practices and gender-specific educational expectations create disparities and challenge the effectiveness of gender equality initiatives. Recent reforms and cultural shifts in Nepal reflect efforts to address these gender imbalances. This study emphasizes the need for policy frameworks that respect cultural traditions while promoting gender equality. By integrating primary qualitative data with secondary sources and using descriptive and analytical methods, the research provides a comprehensive view of the challenges and opportunities in aligning tradition with modern gender equality goals. Ultimately, the study advocates for ongoing reform and cultural adaptation to effectively combat gender discrimination and ensure equal rights for all individuals in Nepal. It underscores the importance of developing policies that acknowledge and integrate cultural contexts while striving for genuine gender equality.",,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

The term PBC is coined to describe the fluctuation in economic activities from the intervention of the political actors before the election expecting to be re-elected in the forthcoming election. The abuse of political power in manipulating fiscal and monetary policies by the ruling party prior to the election period has become normal in developing countries like Nepal. The incumbent tries to convince their voters by increasing the size of the populist public expenditure before or during the election period. Nepal can’t be exceptional in the case of public resource manipulation during the time of the election. Democracy was restored in Nepal after the people’s political movement of 1990 and after that six consequent general elections were completed. The study used the annual data set from 1990/91 to 2017/18 and employed the ordinary least square method in three different models to capture the relationship among the variables used in the study. Real GDP, government consumption expenditure, and fiscal deficit are used as dependent variables of each model whereas government capital expenditure, transfer payment and subsidy, and total tax revenue are taken as independent variables under the study along with introducing election as a dummy variable. The results showed a positive relationship between the variables, but not enough to confirm the opportunistic political business cycle. The study recommends policymakers ensure policy consistency considering non-intervention in fiscal policies at the time of election.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/55074/42216,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Studies on CA under Nepal’s rainfed farming systems of Terai and hills of Nepal improved the soil quality, increased individual crop and system yields, reduced labor demand and was economically profitable. However, lack of adequate soil moisture during planting in initial seasons, inadequate tillage equipment and weed management options are the key constraints of rainfed farming to be transformed into CA in initial stages. In Nepal, the introduction of animal-drawn direct seeding equipment, management of residues or mulches, mechanical or herbicidal weed management options for small-scale rainfed hill farmers can be of paramount significance in scaling-out of the CA based practices in Nepal.

Similarly, more than three million women suffer from severe complications from unsafe abortion every year. In 2002, responding to the public voices and high attribution of unsafe abortion on maternal mortality, Nepal granted legal access to safe abortion introducing safe abortion act. Women can seek abortion up to 12 weeks of gestation for any indication. However, sex selective pregnancy termination is prohibited in Nepal.

The analysis methods has been used the Auto Regression Model and Granger-Causality Tests for achieved the results. The result of the study reveals that there is a significant relationship between the export and economic growth of Nepal. The result showed when export increases by 1 unit then GDP increases by 0.58 units in short run. It indicates that current GDP growth is also affected by past year’s export. Similarly, Granger causality test also shows that export trade caucused to economic growth (p=0.0071) and foreign loan also caucused to economic growth (p=0.0410). It shows that there is a unidirectional causality with economic growth in Nepal. Hence, this study suggests that the policy makers should focus on exportable products which have potential for larger scale productions within the country, and comparative advantage for export trade as well as economic growth in Nepal. Moreover, national economic policy should be focused on investment friendly environment and creating a trust for foreign loan in Nepal.",,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Maternal health indicators at the national level have markedly improved in the last couple of decades in Nepal. However, the progress is not uniform across different population sub-groups. This study aims to identify the determinants of institutional delivery, measure the wealth-related inequality, and examine the key components that explain the inequality. Methods Most recent nationally representative Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019 was used to extract data about married women (15–49 years) with a live birth within two years preceding the survey. Logistic regression models were employed to assess the association of independent variables with the institutional delivery. The concentration curves (CC) and concentration indexe (CIX) were used to analyze the inequality in institutional delivery. Wealth index scores were used as a socio-economic variable to rank households. Decomposition was performed to identify the determinants that explain socio-economic inequality. Results The socio-economic status of households to which women belong was a significant predictor of institutional delivery, along with age, parity, four or more ANC visits, education status of women, area of residence, sex of household head, religious belief, and province. The concentration curve was below the line of equality and the relative concentration index (CIX) was 0.097 (p < 0.001), meaning the institutional delivery was disproportionately higher among women from wealthy groups. The decomposition analysis showed the following variables as the most significant contributor to the inequality: wealth status of women (53.2%), education of women (17 %), residence (8.64 %) and ANC visit (6.84 %). Conclusions The pro-poor strategies are urgent to reduce the existing inequality between wealthy and poorer women. The strategies should focus on raising the education level of women especially from the rural and relatively backward province (Province 2). Increasing antenatal care (ANC) coverage through out-reach campaigns is likely to increase facility-based delivery and decrease inequality. Monitoring of healthcare indicators at different sub-population level (for example wealth, residence, province) is key to ensure equitable improvement in health status and achieve universal health coverage (UHC).",https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-539128/v1,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

The concentration curve (CC) and concentration index (CIX) were used to analyze the inequality in institutional delivery. Wealth index scores were used as a socio-economic variable to rank households. Decomposition was performed to identify the determinants that explain socio-economic inequality. Results: The socio-economic status of households to which women belong was a significant predictor of institutional delivery, along with age, parity, four or more ANC visits, education status of women, area of residence, sex of household head, religious belief, and province. The concentration curve was below the line of equality and the relative concentration index (CIX) was 0.097 ( Conclusions: To reduce the existing socio-economic inequality in institutional delivery, health policies and strategies should focus more on poorest and poor quintiles of the population. The strategies should also focus on raising the education level of women especially from the rural and relatively backward province (Province 2). Increasing antenatal care (ANC) coverage through outreach campaigns is likely to increase facility-based delivery and decrease inequality. Monitoring of healthcare indicators at different sub-population levels (for example wealth, residence, province) is key to ensure equitable improvement in health status and achieve universal health coverage (UHC).",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12889-021-12287-2.pdf,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: We used nationally representative data based on Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019. Out of 10 958 households included in this study, 6.95% households were enroled in at least one health insurance scheme. Primary outcome: measures health insurance (of any type) enrolment. Results: Households were more likely to have health insurance membership when household head have higher secondary education or above compared with households without formal education (adjusted OR 1.87; 95% CI: 1.32 to 2.64)). Households with mass media exposure were nearly three times more likely to get enroled into the schemes compared with their counterparts (adjusted OR 2.96; 95% CI 2.03 to 4.31). Hindus had greater odds of being enroled (adjusted OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.77) compared with non-Hindus. Dalits were less likely to get enroled compared with Brahmin, Chhetri and Madhesi (adjusted OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94). Households from province 2, Bagmati and Sudurpaschim were less likely to have membership compared with households from province 1. Households from Richer and Richest wealth quintiles were more than two times more likely to have health insurance membership compared with households from the poorest wealth quintile. A positive concentration index 0.25 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.30; p<0.001) indicated disproportionately higher health insurance enrolment among wealthy households. Conclusions: Education of household head, exposure to mass media, religious and ethnic background, geographical location (province) and wealth status were key predictors of health insurance enrolment in Nepal. There was a significant wealth-related inequality in health insurance affiliation. The study recommends regular monitoring of inequality in health insurance enrolment across demographic and socioeconomic groups to ensure progress towards Universal Health Coverage.",https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050922,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

The present study assessed the prevalence of suicidal ideation, planned suicide, and attempted suicide among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people (TG) in Nepal, and examined the association of perceived discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation with suicidal ideation and with attempted suicide. Data were obtained from a surveillance survey among MSM and TG in Nepal in 2012. A sample of 400 MSM and TG, recruited using respondent-driven sampling, completed a structured face-to-face interview. Throughout their lifetime, 26.8% of the participants had experienced suicidal ideation, 12.0% had made a suicide plan, and 9.0% had attempted suicide. In particular, more TG than MSM had experienced suicidal ideation (39.8% vs. 21.3%), had made a suicide plan (19.5% vs. 8.9%), and had attempted suicide (15.3% vs. 6.4%). Overall, the odds of having experienced suicidal ideation was significantly higher among the 38.3% of participants who had perceived discrimination based on their sexual orientation (AOR: 3.17; 95% CI: 1.83-5.48). Moreover, the odds of suicidal ideation was significantly higher as the extent of perceived discrimination increased (AOR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.15-1.60).

For these goals to be accomplished, it is important to understand the country's geographical heterogeneity and inequality of access to its drinking-water supply and sanitation (WSS) so that resource allocation and disease control can be optimized. We aimed 1) to estimate spatial heterogeneity of access to improved WSS among the overall Nepalese population at a high resolution; 2) to explore inequality within and between relevant Nepalese administrative levels; and 3) to identify the specific administrative areas in greatest need of policy attention.We extracted cluster-sample data on the use of the water supply and sanitation that included 10,826 surveyed households from the 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, then used a Gaussian kernel density estimation with adaptive bandwidths to estimate the distribution of access to improved WSS conditions over a grid at 1 × 1 km. The Gini coefficient was calculated for the measurement of inequality in the distribution of improved WSS; the Theil L measure and Theil T index were applied to account for the decomposition of inequality.57% of Nepalese had access to improved sanitation (range: 18.1% in Mahottari to 100% in Kathmandu) and 92% to drinking-water (range: 41.7% in Doti to 100% in Bara). The most unequal districts in Gini coefficient among improved sanitation were Saptari, Sindhuli, Banke, Bajura and Achham (range: 0.276 to 0.316); and Sankhuwasabha, Arghakhanchi, Gulmi, Bhojpur, Kathmandu (range: 0.110 to 0.137) among improved drinking-water. Both the Theil L and Theil T showed that within-province inequality was substantially greater than between-province inequality; while within-district inequality was less than between-district inequality. The inequality of several districts was higher than what is calculated by regression of the Gini coefficient and our estimates.This study showed considerable geographical heterogeneity and inequality not evidenced in previous national statistics. Our findings may be useful in prioritizing resources to reduce inequality and expand the coverage of improved water supply and sanitation in Nepal.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12939-018-0754-8.pdf,,SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

The study found that there is a significant contribution of broad money supply, market capitalization and NEPSE index to real GDP. But, there is a weak contribution of stock market turnover to real GDP that indicates a liquidity problem in Nepalese stock market. It concludes that stock market development has a significant contribution for economic growth in Nepal.
