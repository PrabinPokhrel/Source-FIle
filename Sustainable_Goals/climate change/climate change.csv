The combination of variable torrential rainfall patterns and heavy monsoons, both extreme heat and cold, along with steep terrain, increase the risks of floods including Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFS), landslides, droughts, and waterborne diseases (WBDs). Nepals communities are particularly vulnerable to climate change, as they are already hampered by poverty, being located in remote areas and operating on subsistence agriculture. Given Nepals high exposure and vulnerability to climate change, the World Bank, through the Health Climate and Environment Program (HCEP), is conducting a Climate and Health Vulnerability Assessment (CHVA) in Nepal. The objective of this CHVA is to assist decision-makers with planning effective adaptation measures to deal with climate-related health risks. Where available, these measures are provided at a subnational level to assist regional health planners. The recommendations of this CHVA are primarily targeted at the health sector and related sectors that influence health risks from climate changes, such as disaster risk management (DRM).",,,SDG 13: Climate Action

This report is organized as follows: Chapter 1 captures the current situation in the country with respect to climate impacts and risks, emission sources, and opportunities for integrated climate change adaptation and mitigation. Chapter 2 describes the governments response, through sectoral and economywide commitments, laws, and regulations. Chapter 3 assesses the impacts of climate change on the macroeconomy and road transport systems, given their critical role to connectivity. It also analyzes the links between climate change and air pollution, poverty, health, social inclusion, and community resilience. Chapter 4 presents pathways to transition to resilience, looking at integrated management of landscape systems comprising water, agriculture, and forests as well as strengthening climate and disaster risk management governance. Chapter 5 analyzes pathways to transition to decarbonization, primarily the potential for hydropower expansion domestically and in the region. It also looks at transport and urban opportunities to reduce emissions while enhancing resilience and adaptation co-benefits. Chapter 6 discusses how to scale up financing for resilience, hydropower, and other opportunities, given the limitations of the countrys fiscal space. Chapter 7 presents a prioritization framework for the most transformational climate action with seven policy packagesone for each priority transition and each key enablerthat contain specific recommendations for how to move from analysis to action.",,,SDG 13: Climate Action

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated an increase of global GHG emissions by 25 to 90% between 2000 and 2030. As per IPCC estimate, the global average surface temperature will increase between 1.8 to 4.0Â°C and precipitation will increase by 5 to 20% over the period of 1990 to 2100. Understanding potential hydrologic influences to projected climate change is important for management of water resources. This study estimates the climate change impacts on hydrologic processes of Bagmati watershed in Nepal using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Past climate data were obtained from Department of Hydrology and Meteorology. Digital Elevation model (DEM) and Soil data were obtained from free online server. The performance of the model was found to be good, both during the calibration and validation period. The performance statistics were better for monthly stream-flow as compared to the daily stream-flow. In order to study the impact of climate change, the outputs (i.e., temperature and precipitation) from global climate models (GCMs) are used to drive SWAT model. The GCM used in this study is from IPCC Fifth Assessment report. This study will demonstrate that the temporal differences in hydrologic responses to future climate changes in Bagmati watershed, Nepal. Uncertainty remains regarding the future hydrologic changes due to the uncertainty of future climate changes, especially precipitation patterns, the future dynamics of vegetation and land use, and partly due to the SWAT model processes uncertainty.",http://elibrary.asabe.org/azdez.asp?JID=5&AID=45991&t=2&v=&i=&CID=norl2015&redir=aid=45991&redir=%5Bconfid=norl2015%5D&redirType=&downPDF=Y,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Quantifying long-term changes in climatic variables and their effect on streamflow are crucial for understanding watershed hydrology and developing effective climate adaptation and water management strategies. In this study, we aim to quantify the changes in precipitation, temperature, and streamflow over the last 70 years (1950-2020) for two glacierized catchments in Nepal: Marsyangdi and Budigandaki River Basins. We utilize a distributed hydrological model (HYMOD_DS) forced by the most recent release of the ERA5 Land reanalysis product. Our investigation focuses on evaluating the impact of spatiotemporal changes in precipitation phases (either snow or rainfall) on streamflow characteristics. Specifically, we analyze the temporal trends and changes in the distribution of snow and rainfall and resulting streamflow separated into surface runoff and baseflow at daily and seasonal scales. The ERA5 Land reanalysis indicates a decrease in mean annual total precipitation for the period 1950-1980 and an increasing trend afterward. Annual mean temperature exhibits a rising trend for the entire period. Streamflow simulations for both basins revealed a significantly increased total flow over the last 20 years, primarily due to an increase in rainfall-induced streamflow. The results from this study will provide critical insight into the hydrology of glacierized basins and serve as a reference for water resources planning under climate change.&lt;/p&gt;",,,SDG 13: Climate Action

It generates enterprise and employment, increases income and helps in sustaining livelihood of local people. There is a close relationship between climate and tourism in ecosystem tourism, coastal tourism, mountain tourism and nature-based tourism. Climate change brings more risks than opportunities by causing regional and seasonal shifts in tourist flows. This paper is based on the review of researches on climate change and tourism. Climate change had caused shift in destination choice of tourists. It had reduced barrier of winter tourism in Nepal in short term. But, unfavorable weather change phenomena had taken lives of many tourists in Nepal and had caused discomfort in transportation in mountain regions. It would decrease the flow of tourists in long term and decrease the income from tourism. It will further cause adverse impact on livelihood of tourism dependent people.

Nitrogen fertilizer must be applied only when necessary and must be based on the cropâs nitrogen requirement. Losses of nitrogen from rice field can cause air pollutant production, global warming and climate change. Leaf Color Chart (LCC) poses potential climate smart practice in rice field. The use of LCC is a low cost and viable method for managing nitrogen in real time, enhancing the nitrogen use efficiency. To demonstrate the effectiveness of LCC based urea application for nitrogen management in rice, a field experiment was conducted at Masala Bali Bikash Kendra, Panchkhal from June to November, 2022. Variety selected for field experimentation was Makawanpur-1. The experiment compared government-recommended urea application with LCC-based application for which field was divided into two equal plots (300 sq m). Morphological growth was measured at different stages of rice and yield was taken at maturity. In rice, LCC-based urea application led to taller plants (128.5 cm) compared to blanket urea application (115.56 cm) at harvest. LCC-based urea application also had 34% more leaves (126) and 54.5% higher effective tiller count (17). Despite the same rate of nitrogen application, yield was 35% higher in LCC based practice (4694.73 kg ha-1) than government recommended practice. Real time nitrogen application in splits based on LCC management led to better plant growth and yield, while fixed-time nitrogen application regardless of crop need in conventional blanket application resulted in nitrogen loss and lower yield. Considering the effect of nitrogen application through LCC management on rice productivity, it's clear that LCC offers valuable chances to enhance nitrogen use efficiency, rice yield, and farmers' profits.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/62066/46841,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Climate variability is one of the major causes of food insecurity, poverty, and inequality in the country. Marginalized and vulnerable communities, particularly women, suffer the most severe consequences of climate change. In this paper, we qualitatively analyze primary and secondary data to understand how gender considerations are integrated into agriculture and climate change policies. It aims to identify gaps in integrating gender considerations into policies and practices. Climate changeâs challenges on agriculture and food security have been identified in most agricultural policies; however, those policies remain quiet on the gender-specific impacts of climate change. Representation mandates are not sufficiently linked with officialsâ overall performance, resulting in limited representation of women in budget formulation, project and program design, planning, and resource and opportunity allocation. As a way forward, our analysis suggests addressing the gaps at the policy and institutional levels. For instance, to effectively address climate change, policies should be developed with a gender-inclusive approach, along with budgetary allocations that consider the gender-specific impact of climate change. Promoting gender equality in climate-resilient agriculture in Nepal requires measures such as empowering womenâs networks, establishing linkages with extension services that focus on women-led cooperatives, and investing in affordable and climate-smart tools and machinery that are women-friendly. The study offers important insights for policymakers to create gender-inclusive policies.

Using primary survey data of 316 farmers from 9 farmer-managed irrigation systems in the Trishuli-Narayani sub-basin of Central Nepal, among other results, we document that smallholder farmers are likely to choose rice during the monsoon season if they are experienced and farm in the irrigation systems fed by large rivers. Water stress affects the crop choice mainly in two ways. In irrigation systems fed by large rivers, farmers located towards the tail-end of the canal are less likely to plant rice due to water stress. Farmers living in the irrigation systems that are fed by small and medium-size rivers are more likely to choose less water-demanding crops. Market integration is also a key determinant of crop choice.

All parties ratifying the Paris Agreement have submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), many stating emission reduction targets. The international climate research community has designed five different Shared Socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to characterize various possibilities in demographic and economic changes over the next century. These SSPs were implemented by six integrated assessment model (IAM) teams, which also determined the carbon price trajectory required to limit the temperature rise below 2Â°C in respective SSPs. In SSP5, also termed the fossil-fueled development scenario, only three IAMs identified that the 2Â°C target would be feasible, with carbon prices ranging from 220 to 518 US$/tCO2e in 2050. This study aims to analyse the effects of these carbon prices on energy and emissions during 2015â2050 in Nepal. It does so using a long-term energy system model using the framework of the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/Enduse (AIM/Enduse) modelling tool. The base case scenario and three carbon price scenarios are developed. Primary energy supply, energy security, energy technology-mix (especially renewable energy usage and hydropower development), emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and local pollutants, and local/regional environmental co-benefits are compared between the base case scenario and carbon price scenarios. The study finds that the implementation of a carbon tax would promote domestic hydropower, improve energy-efficiency and reduce imports of fossil fuels when compared to the base case. Hydropower-based electricity would have a major role in reducing emissions.Key policy insights The carbon prices in SSP5 determined by IAMs to achieve the 2Â°C target would be sufficient to achieve Nepal's targets under its NDC in the energy sector.The industry and transport sectors would offer the highest GHG emission reduction.Hydropower and biomass would have major roles in decarbonizing the energy system.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14693062.2020.1740149,,SDG 13: Climate Action

The factors influencing whether to adopt climate adaptation practices in agriculture was analyzed using binary logit model. The education level of household head, household size, food self-sufficiency from their own production and inadequacy of current knowledge on agricultural adaptation influenced the adoption. In the Nepalese context, where agricultural occupation is the dominant means of living, climate adaptation seems to be the most efficient and friendly way for farmers to neutralize the potential adverse effects.

Being an agrarian economy and dependent on monsoon rain, the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity and production has been experienced. Different adaptation strategies have been adopted by the communities to cope with the consequences of climate change. Design/methodology/approach: Four village development committees (VDCs) situated in the buffer zone of Langtang National Park of Rasuwa district representing rice, wheat, maize and potato production area was purposively selected for this study. A two-stage sampling technique was adopted for data and information collection. Thirty households from each VDC were randomly selected. Data on the socio-economic and climate change perception were collected using structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression technique was used to identify the determinants of climate change adaptation technologies and practices. Findings: The farmersâ decisions whether to adopt climate change adaptation technologies are governed by the size of landholding, perceived threat of climate change to food security, education level and gender of the interviewee, perception on the increased incidence of droughts during rainy season and income received from the off-farm sources. In a community where agricultural activity is the dominant means of living, adaptive strategies help to increase the capacity of a farming system to survive external shocks and cope with the consequences. Originality/value: The assessment of farm-level adaptation strategies and factors influencing their adoption decision is important to formulate policies and design programs.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sixth assessment report of 2021 termed the climate crisis asÂ  âCode Redâ, signifying that climate change is already causing substantial physical, environmental, social, and economic losses, and damages in both developing and developed countries. The impacts of climate change are disproportionate for countries like Nepal, which must bear the brunt of the impacts even though their contribution to making global warming is minimal. However, the politics of developed and the developing countries and changing economic realities of many influential nations complicate multilateral, bilateral, trilateral and regional climate negotiations. Most recent scientific reports suggest that if countries do not take decisive action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions now, the world is going beyond the 2Â°C rise limit soon and will affect, inter alia, the mountain ecosystem, freshwater system, agriculture, livelihood, and development practices. The impacts of climate change are increasing rapidly in various sectors of Nepali human and natural ecosystems. Therefore, addressing the impacts of it is paramount, and requires mitigation and adaptation measures, which includes efficacious climate diplomacy. Qualitative assessments indicate that Nepal needs to adopt aÂ Â  new approach to climate diplomacy to ethically encourage big economies and the rest of the world to go beyond conventional binary options of relations between the developed and developing countries. Adaptation and mitigation are the best available approaches to addressing climate change vulnerabilities and building resilient communities. Therefore, an interdisciplinary negotiation team would be needed in the diplomatic efforts to articulate priorities and evidence-based impacts and for tapping the international resources â state-of-art-knowledge, finances, and technologies â to assist the country to fight against climate threats.Â ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/jofa/article/download/44005/33205,,SDG 13: Climate Action

While this change poses a major global environmental challenge, particularly affecting Asia, a few studies argue the ramifications of climate change for national security. As a Himalayan country, Nepal, being unique topographically with an altitude ranging from 60m to 8848.86m, is prone to various kinds of disasters, including climate change-induced among many. Existing scholarship on national security, few have explored the potential threats due to its impacts, however, the domestic literature lacks clarity on Nepalâs vulnerability towards this. In this context, geographically located in the lap of the Himalayas, Nepal has been lagging far behind in grasping the issue of climate change through the lens of national security. This study maps the possible connection between these two by examining the major adverse environmental trends and disasters that pose a security threat to Nepal. It also aims to explore the ways to potential mitigating or adaptation measures to the effects of climate change on national security which eventually helps security professionals, scholars, and decision-makers.

In Nepal, agriculture is a highly climate sensitive sector. Historically, the sector has been affected by floods, droughts and erratic rainfall. This study focused on the impacts and economic costs of climate change in agriculture and assessed perceptions of communities of Kaski and Mustang districts on frequency and intensity of hailstorm events over time including their related impacts. Scenario-based impact assessment was used for assessment of long-term impacts and economic costs of climate change. The study used Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) model to analyze the effects of climate on three major crops, namely rice, maize and wheat. The economic loss due to the impacts of climate change in cereals (rice, maize and wheat) was estimated at around US$ 336.42 million in the year 2006. Among the respondents, 60% reported food shortages which made them highly vulnerable due to climate variability. Similarly, 80% of the respondents mentioned that 20 major hailstorm events have occurred in the vicinity of their communities over the last 35 years (up to 2012) and have caused significant damage to crop production, livestock and infrastructure. DesInventar database reported damage of 75% to 100% of the key crops. Crop yield projections indicate a complex mix of increases and decreases in yield which vary over time (in projections in 2030 AD and 2070 AD) and by location (east to west/Terai to Mountains). In the 2030s, there is a net increase in production and values; however, by the 2070s, the impact in agricultural production is expected to reach to US$ 140 million/year (2014).

There has been little work done to reconcile these drivers of water stress in the Himalayas. This paper evaluates how climate change may affect water availability in two Nepalese mountain communities, Panglin and Tallo Lorpa, and assesses whether these changes drive vulnerability to water stress. First, estimates of hydrological change are made based on climate model output and hydroclimatological theory. Household surveys, focus group discussions and participatory rural appraisal techniques are used to assess vulnerability and adaptive capacity in each community. Finally, the expected effects of climate change on water availability are linked to findings on the communities' vulnerability to these changes. The results show that both communities are vulnerable to changes in water availability under climate change, but this vulnerability is small in comparison to adaptation opportunities. However, the ability to appropriate benefits from these opportunities is constrained, and it is the extent of this inhibition that determines vulnerability. These findings demonstrate that Malthusian interpretations may be inappropriate in the Himalayas, and highlight the importance of the constraints to climate change adaptation.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17565529.2015.1067184,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Provided this background, this chapter reviews how social work practice, especially green social work approaches, has been applied in the recovery and rehabilitation of communities facing environmental disasters in India and Nepal in the last ten years. The chapter makes a case for the critical needs for revisiting social work practices and the need for introducing green social work practices to nurture disaster resilience communities in the South Asian region.

We examine multi-scale climate policy and politics in Nepal, focusing on three elements that are important for policy development and implementation: (a) the authority to make decisions; (b) the knowledge and expertise to develop and implement policies; and (c) the ability to access and mobilize resources, primarily external funding, by government bodies at different levels. Our findings show that the newly decentralized local governments are constrained in their ability to develop and implement climate change-related policies and practical responses by a mismatch between the authority granted to them and existing institutional capabilities. These governmental bodies have limited opportunities to develop, access and mobilize knowledge of climate and development and financial resources, which are needed to put new policies into action. Based on this analysis, we argue that decentralization of governmental authority is not likely to produce effective climate policy outcomes if this mismatch remains unaddressed.KEY POLICY INSIGHTS The ability of the provincial and local governments in federal Nepal to respond to climate change has been constrained by a pervasive mismatch between authority granted and institutional capabilities, in terms of opportunities to access and mobilize knowledge and financial resources.The devolution of power is not adequate for effective climate change responses; rather, there is a need to strengthen the institutional capabilities and opportunities of the decentralized local governments to address climate change.Formal allocation of authority is always blurred in practice, as agencies at different levels of governance engage in power struggles within and beyond formally delineated boundaries. This suggests the need for more operational clarity on policy implementation procedures.There is a need for a clear exchange of knowledge and a flow of resources to the level where responsibilities lie to respond to climate change.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14693062.2022.2090891,,SDG 13: Climate Action

It affects widely on diverse sectors such as water resources, agriculture, forestry, human health, biodiversity, and snow cover and aquatic life. Nepal is experiencing the adverse impact of climate change; this includes such as a variability in temperature and precipitation, overbank flooding from snow-fed rivers, and variability in available river and stream water quantity. Climate in the Nepal Himalayas is changing faster than the global average. Moreover, the changes in the high-altitudes have been found more pronounced than in the low-altitudes. Since, there is no definite trend that could be found in the annual precipitation records, clear decreasing trends could be seen in annual number of rainy days during the study period of 1971-2000. The glaciers in the Nepal Himalayas are shrinking rapidly and there will be no glaciers left by 2180. An accelerated glacier melt will cause an increase in water availability at the beginning but ultimately a decrease in water availability after the glaciers disappear. This will widen the gap between water supply and demand. Changing climate may further exacerbate the water stress which already happening in Nepal due to the monsoon dominated climate. Climate change (CC) will also further increase the seasonal imbalance- too much of water during rainy season and too less of it during dry seasons. Rainwater harvesting technology has the potential to provide numerous benefits to communities and individuals, particularly in areas where water resources are scarce or unreliable. From the analysis and through our research work it is found that if we can simply install and construct rainwater harvesting technology in our individual household only. It nearly fulfills about 15-25% of our domestic water demand. As in urban and rural area of Nepal still nearly about 50% of water demand is fulfilled by groundwater source which increase to 60-70% in dry season.

First, future projections of 26 climate indices relevant to six climate-sensitive sectors in Karnali are made for the near (2021â2045), mid (2046â2070), and far (2071â2095) future for low- and high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) using bias-corrected ensembles of 19 regional climate models from the COordinated Regional Downscaling EXperiment for South Asia (CORDEX-SA). Second, a qualitative analysis based on expert interviews and a literature review on the impact of the projected climate extremes on the climate-sensitive sectors is undertaken. Both the temperature and precipitation patterns are projected to deviate significantly from the historical reference already from the near future with increased occurrences of extreme events. Winter in the highlands is expected to become warmer and dryer. The hot and wet tropical summer in the lowlands will become hotter with longer warm spells and fewer cold days. Low-intensity precipitation events will decline, but the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events will increase. The compounding effects of the increase in extreme temperature and precipitation events will have largely negative implications for the six climate-sensitive sectors considered here.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10584-021-03216-8.pdf,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Not much is known about temperature and precipitation trends along the different bioclimatic zones nor how changes in these parameters might impact the whole natural process, including biodiversity and ecosystems, in the CHAL. Analysis of daily temperature and precipitation time series data (1970â2019) was carried out in seven bioclimatic zones extending from lowland Terai to the higher Himalayas. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was applied to determine the trends, which were quantified by Senâs slope. Annual and decade interval average temperature, precipitation trends, and lapse rate were analyzed in each bioclimatic zone. In the seven bioclimatic zones, precipitation showed a mixed pattern of decreasing and increasing trends (four bioclimatic zones showed a decreasing and three bioclimatic zones an increasing trend). Precipitation did not show any particular trend at decade intervals but the pattern of rainfall decreases after 2000AD. The average annual temperature at different bioclimatic zones clearly indicates that temperature at higher elevations is increasing significantly more than at lower elevations. In lower tropical bioclimatic zone (LTBZ), upper tropical bioclimatic zone (UTBZ), lower subtropical bioclimatic zone (LSBZ), upper subtropical bioclimatic zone (USBZ), and temperate bioclimatic zone (TBZ), the average temperature increased by 0.022, 0.030, 0.036, 0.042 and 0.051 Â°C/year, respectively. The decade level temperature scenario revealed that the hottest decade was from 1999â2009 and average decade level increases of temperature at different bioclimatic zones ranges from 0.2 to 0.27 Â°C /decade. The average temperature and precipitation was found clearly different from one bioclimatic zone to other. This is the first time that bioclimatic zone level precipitation and temperature trends have been analyzed for the CHAL. The rate of additional temperature rise at higher altitudes compared to lower elevations meets the requirements to mitigate climate change in different bioclimatic zones in a different ways. This information would be fundamental to safeguarding vulnerable communities, ecosystem and relevant climate-sensitive sectors from the impact of climate change through formulation of sector-wise climate change adaptation strategies and improving the livelihood of rural communities.",https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/11/136/pdf,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Thus, the choice of species should include species that would be expected to grow within the elevation zone or in the particular habitat under future climate change scenarios. In this analysis, we have assessed the response of 12 important tree species to climate change using the IPCC A2A GHG scenario with GCM-based climate envelopes to provide guidelines and recommendations for climate change-integrated forest restoration and management in the Chitwan-Annapurna Landscape (CHAL). The results indicate that several species could exhibit range shifts due to climate change, with an overall trend for species in the lower elevations to move northwards or further up the slopes within the current area of distributions.

However, the question of when institutions could also limit adaptation is much less explored. Drawing on the case of a landslide in the Nepal Himalayas, this paper advances the concept of âinstitutional limitâ, for examining the extent to which local institutions can deliver adaptation outcomes. We show how existing public and community institutions have limited householdsâ capacity to respond to the risk of landslides. The case study demonstrates at least four limits of local institutions: a) inertia created by the social norms and structure embedded in the existing institutions; b) redundancy wherein conventional formal and informal institutions are less relevant to tackle the new challenges posed by climate change; c) fragmentation of institutional efforts involving poor horizontal and vertical coordination among organisations; and d) accountability lapses rooted in the wider political system. We show that most of the local institutions identified in the literature as important sources of resilience have failed to tackle landslides in the highly stratified and politically volatile situation of the Nepal Himalayas where the case study is located. We argue that the notion of âinstitutional limitâ can enhance our understanding of what institutions can (or cannot) deliver for effective local adaptation.

High soil organic carbon (SOC) content in soil is vital as it leads to improved soil quality, increased productivity, and stable soil-aggregates. In addition, with the signing of the climate agreement, there is growing interest in carbon sequestration in landscapes. This paper looks at how SOC can be increased so that it not only contributes to reduction of CO2, but also translates to increased food production thereby enhancing food security. This synergy between mitigation and enhancing food security is even more relevant for mountain landscapes of the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region where there remains huge potential to increase CO2 sequestration and simultaneously address food security in the chronic food deficit villages. Soil samples were collected from seven transects each in Bajhang and Mustang and from 4 land use types in each transect. Samples of soils were taken from two depths in each plot; 0-15 cm below the soil surface and 15-30 cm below the soil surface to compare the top soil and subsoil dynamics of the soil nutrients. The lab analysis was performed to assess the soil texture, soil color, soil acidity in 'power of hydrogen' (pH), macro-nutrients as soil fertility. Secondary data was used to analyze the level of food deficit in the villages. The result shows that most of the sample soils from Mustang were clay (82.1%) which is 46 samples out of 56. The pH value of soil from Bajhang ranged from 5.29 to 9.09. The pH value of soil ranged from 5.65 to 8.81 in Mustang. SOC contents of sampled soils from Bajhang ranged from 0.20% to 7.69% with mean amount of 2.47% &plusmn; 0.17. SOC contents of sampled soils from Mustang ranged from 0.51% to 8.56% with mean amount of 2.60% &plusmn; 0.25. By land use type, forest land had the highest carbon (C) content of 53.61 t ha-1 in Bajhang whereas in Mustang, agricultural land had the highest C content of 52.02 tons ha-1. Based on these data, we can say that there is potential for increasing SOC through improved soil health and crop production and soil. Sustainable soil management should be practiced for higher productivity. Livestock may also provide farmyard manure, which can be used to fertilize cultivated soils, which increases soil productivity. Increasing productivity would aid in increasing the access and availability of food in these mountain villages.",,,SDG 13: Climate Action

The index-based assessment of vulnerability to climate change and variability is typically used to identify administrative-level regions of high vulnerability using various socioeconomic and biophysical datasets. One method that combines both approaches at the community level consists of collecting highly resolved socio-economic data and using the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) to assess population vulnerability to increased climate variability and shocks. We use this mixed-methods approach in mapping climate vulnerability of ten drought-prone villages in the central-east mid-hill region of Nepal. We integrate data from over 900 household surveys and national-level databases and identify spatial patterns in the different components of climate vulnerability. We assess to what extent climatic extremes or people's socioeconomic capacity contribute to vulnerability and may shape development needs at the sub-district scale. We find that the majority of our study area falls in the high vulnerability category with significant spatial variation. In some villages, there are different vulnerability classes in different wards, indicating that even within the lowest administrative units, there is a significant spatial variation in the level of vulnerability. Livelihood strategies, water availability, and topographic components played the most important role in determining overall vulnerability and we measure strong interconnections among different components. The interconnectedness nature of different vulnerability components is creating a self-reinforcing downward spiral of vulnerability that traps local communities in a state of heightened vulnerability. We conclude that adaptation strategies in highly vulnerable regions should include careful consideration of different livelihoods and environmental components, their fine-scale spatial variations, and interconnections.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17565529.2018.1521329,,SDG 13: Climate Action

In this study, a high-resolution glacio-hydrological model is coupled with an hourly-resolution power grid model to evaluate the climate change influences on hydropower generation across Nepal. Four climate future scenarios namely Cold-Dry, Warm-Dry, Cold-Wet, and Warm-Wet are developed to compare the changes in water availability and optimal power system with historical climate. The total flow increases for the wet scenarios (+11.4% under Cold-Wet for the Koshi basin), compared to the dry scenarios (-24.6% under Warm-Dry for the Karnali basin) for all the major river basins in Nepal. The results illustrate the distribution and magnitude of changes in total water availability and power generation are not proportional for dry and wet scenarios as a ~20% reduction of water availability in the dry scenarios only results in a ~2Ã¢â¬â3% decrease in electricity generation. The capacity requirements of hydro storage decrease by 7.2 GW for Cold-Wet and 6.8 GW for Warm-Wet scenarios compared to historical climate indicating higher capacity requirements in dry scenarios. Larger impacts observed at higher altitudes suggest more attentive adaptation strategies in developing climate-resilient hydropower systems. Results suggest that Nepal should not be entirely focused on exploiting its hydropower potential but rather diversifying the generation mix including solar PV and hydrogen technology. For the least-cost power system expansion, the Warm-Wet climate appears to be the most desirable and a cost savings of about 3.76 billion USD in hydropower development can be realized if better adaptation strategies are employed.",,,SDG 13: Climate Action

The findings indicate that the Nepalâs monsoon patterns do not follow a definitive trend. Parameters such as onset and withdrawal dates, duration and distribution are quite unpredictable. The patterns, however, do have direct impact on national average rice yields, but that effect has turned less sensitive in recent years. The findings suggest that though monsoon has vital role on rice production in Nepal, where agriculture systems depend primarily on rainfall, more research is required to predict more accurately and precisely the production functions and relationships to yield.

Climate models suggest that global warming could bring warmer, drier conditions to Nepalese high Mountains due to the large topographical differences of the climate parameters. Although precipitation increases are projected by some models, on the glaciers of the Nepalese high Mountains, a detailed knowledge of mass-balance observation and discharge measurement are considered and the combination of both will be analyzed by means of either Water Balance Model (WatBal) or General Climate Model (GCM) with multi criteria model performance evaluation. To obtain reasonable and ensemble result, the discharge measurements should be taken during the melting season which demonstrates that timing of runoff. In most cases, the Water Balance Model CLIRUN3 was combined with 20 years of basic climate information records (precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and water flow) to simulate monthly river runoff in the river basin. Ultimately the flow of river is part of the watershed while the others belong to forest lands. The model will be calibrated and run for both watersheds under scenarios with temperature increments of +1 and +2Â°C, while the precipitation changes considered were Â±15% for the locality and Â±20% for the overall river basin. It was observed that the monthly runoff tends to considerable decrease of the mean value in the watersheds when temperature increases and precipitation decreases. If both temperature and precipitation increase, the mean runoff value in the region will be reduced by considerable amount as 5 to 35% from monsoon to non-monsoon season. In the basin of the locality, this will also cause to potential evaporation. Thus, soil moisture and water availability may decrease over much of Kaligandaki river basin with serious consequences for rained and irrigated agriculture, urban and water supplies, hydropower and ecosystems. However, the assessment of global warming impacts on locality is an uncertain task because the projections of different models vary widely, particularly for precipitation, and because it performs poorly in reproducing the observed climate condition of Kaliganadaki. At the end, this will help to formulate numerical flow line glacier model on high Mountains of Nepal at upstream of Kaligandaki river, also this paper concludes with a brief discussion of some other areas of uncertainty in the hydrological modeling of Kaligandaki River flows and possible alternative, external forcing mechanisms for flows in the next few decades.",,,SDG 13: Climate Action

First, future projections of 26 climate indices relevant to six climate-sensitive sectors in Karnali are made for the near (2021&#8211;2045), mid (2046&#8211;2070), and far (2071&#8211;2095) future for low- and high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) using bias-corrected ensembles of 19 regional climate models from the COordinated Regional Downscaling EXperiment for South Asia (CORDEX-SA). Second, a qualitative analysis based on expert interviews and a literature review on the impact of the projected climate extremes on the climate-sensitive sectors is undertaken. We also used widely available global data sets such as DesInventar and national census data and disaster-specific mixed-effects regression models to assess the impact of precipitation extremes on landslide and flood mortality. &#160;Both the temperature and precipitation patterns are projected to deviate significantly from the historical reference already from the near future with increased occurrences of extreme events. Results show winter in the highlands is expected to become warmer and dryer. The hot and wet tropical summer in the lowlands will become hotter with longer warm spells and fewer cold days. Low-intensity precipitation events will decline, but the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events will increase. Furthermore, an increase in one standardized unit in maximum one-day precipitation increases flood mortality by 33%, and heavy rain days increase landslide mortality by 45%.",,,SDG 13: Climate Action

The authors analyze the distributional impacts of these hazards by combining spatial distributions of exposure with measures of socio-economic vulnerability and coping ability. While landslides are more likely to occur in the northern mountainous areas of Nepal, the southern parts of Nepal are at higher exposure to river flooding, heat, and drought hazards. Coping ability is highest in the southern lowlands (Terai) and urban settlements, which leaves northern, mountainous areas more vulnerable, despite being less affected. New human settlements in mountainous areas are built on steeper slopes as flat land in valleys has become scarce, which increases their vulnerability to floods and landslides. Forward modelling (2041-2060) shows increasing severity of heat and intensifying extreme rainfall. The increase in extreme precipitation events affects particularly the historically less-affected western provinces with relatively low economic development. Overall, the northern parts of the country will require concerted support to withstand shocks, and in the south, investments in agricultural livelihoods will be needed to support adaptation to climate risk. Proactive, spatially targeted investments are needed by all levels of government to mitigate the welfare impacts of these diverse climate change hazards.

This book delves into the intricate connections between land-use and climate change in Nepal, shedding light on significant challenges and potential opportunities. Nepal, with its diverse topography and ecosystems, is exceptionally susceptible to the impacts of climate change. The distinctive land-use patterns, encompassing agriculture, forest cover, and urbanization, significantly influence the country's climate resilience and carbon balance. However, rapid population growth, urban expansion, and changing land-use practices have led to environmental degradation and a surge in greenhouse gas emissions. The alarming deforestation, driven by agricultural expansion, infrastructure development, and unsustainable logging, has contributed to carbon emissions and the depletion of vital ecosystem services. Consequently, the conversion of forested land into agricultural fields has negatively affected biodiversity, soil erosion, and water resources, intensifying the vulnerability of communities to climate change. Nevertheless, embracing sustainable land-use practices like afforestation, reforestation, and agroforestry holds promise for mitigating the impacts of climate change and enhancing resilience. The promotion of climate-smart agriculture, watershed management, and community-based forestry can aid in conserving ecosystems, sequestering carbon, and improving livelihoods. This study illustrates the intricate relationship between land-use and climate change, emphasizing the importance of striking a balance in land-use practices, conserving forests, and biodiversity, and promoting sustainable agriculture. These efforts are indispensable for achieving climate resilience and sustainable development in Nepal. By addressing the nexus between land-use and climate change, Nepal can pave the way towards a more sustainable and climate-resilient future. The purpose of this book is to present the core concepts of this issue, inspire further research, and propose solutions to mitigate the problems caused by human disturbances in the Earth's ecosystem.",,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Acknowledging this predicament, the Global North has enhanced transitional efforts to green economies and further committed to mobilize climate finance in support of adaptation and mitigation measures in affected regions in the Global South. In recent years, effective coordination has become critical in ensuring that climate adaptation finance achieves the intended outcomes. However, the climate finance coordination debate has largely been centered at the global level with the Global North and donor organizations focusing mainly on transfer channels and paying limited attention to coordination mechanisms in recipient countries. In the Global South, the debate has mainly centered around domestic policy and institutional mechanisms with limited attention to the complex north-south, political and power interactions. Using the theory synthesis approach, this article examines the extent to which power relations between donor and recipient countries affect climate finance coordination from the global to subnational levels. The analysis is based on the World Bank-Led Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) as implemented in Nepal, Mozambique, Bangladesh, and Zambia. This article stresses the need for stakeholders and actors to look beyond the technical understanding of climate finance coordination to acknowledge it for the complex, nonlinear, and political process that it is. It further emphasizes that coordination outcomes are enhanced when actors exercise power with others (cooperation, learning, and deliberation) as opposed to power over others (coercion and manipulation).",https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full-xml/10.1089/scc.2022.0093,,SDG 13: Climate Action

We applied an institutional analysis and development framework as well as an institutional grammar tool to analyze national climate policy. We found that the current national institutions did not enable effective climate change mitigation. Despite relevant political decisions being made, the arrangements were enacted slowly. Contrary to development issues, climate issues were not tackled across all of the relevant sectors, such as waste management, traffic, and agriculture, nor across governance levels, while there was little coherence between development and climate policies. Instead, community forestry was set in the main charge of climate actions, as explained by the history of development collaboration.

Therefore, climate-induced water security concerns have now become more pronounced in Nepal as changes in temperature and precipitation have already altered some hydrological processes such as the river runoff in some river systems. However, the linkage between precipitation patterns and streamflow characteristics are poorly understood, especially in small rivers. We analysed the temporal trends of temperature, precipitation, and extreme indices of wet and dry spells in the Rosi watershed in Central Nepal, and observed the temporal patterns of the streamflow of the Rosi river. We also examined the linkages between the average and extreme climate indices and streamflow. We found that the area has warmed up by an average of 0.03 Â°C/year, and has seen a significant decline in precipitation.

However, the role of climate stresses on local conflicts over natural resources, the role of policies and adaptation in these conflicts, and opportunities to enhance cooperation have been neglected. These gaps are addressed in this paper using evidence from participatory action research on 79 cases of local collective action over natural resources that experience conflicts in Bangladesh and Nepal. Climate trends and stresses contributed to just under half of these conflict cases. Nine factors that enable greater cooperation and transformation of conflict are identified. Participatory dialogue and negotiation processes, while not sufficient, changed understanding, attitudes and positions of actors. Many of the communities innovated physical measures to overcome natural resource constraints, underlying conflict, and/or institutional reforms. These changes were informed by improving understanding of resource limitations and indigenous knowledge. Learning networks among community organizations encouraged collective action by sharing successes and creating peer pressure. Incentives for cooperation were important. For example, when community organizations formally permitted excluded traditional resource users to access resources, those actors complied with rules and paid towards management costs. However, elites were able to use policy gaps to capture resources with changed characteristics due to climate change. In most of the cases where conflict persisted, power, policy and institutional barriers prevented community-based organizations from taking up potential adaptations and innovations. Policy frameworks recognizing collective action and supporting flexible innovation in governance and adaptation would enable wider transformation of natural resource conflicts into cooperation.Key policy insights Climate stresses, policy gaps and interventions can all worsen local natural resource conflicts.Sectoral knowledge and technical approaches to adaptation are open to elite capture and can foster conflicts.Many local natural resource conflicts can be resolved but this requires an enabling environment for participatory dialogue, external facilitation, flexible responses to context, and recognition of disadvantaged stakeholder interests.Transforming conflict to greater cooperation mostly involves social and institutional changes, so adaptation policies should focus less on physical works and more on enabling factors such as negotiation, local institutions, knowledge, and incentives.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14693062.2018.1527678,,SDG 13: Climate Action

It concludes that National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010 can be a milestone in sectoral adaptation of climate change issue largely because it has provided the national framework for sectoral adaptation to climate change. However, NAPA ignores the importance of structural and institutional reforms needed for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into sectoral agencies.

This calls for a clear understanding of linkages between climate goals and other SDGs at national level for formulating synergistic policies and strategies and developing different sectoral programs and coherent cross-sectoral policies. This is even more important for least developed countries such as Nepal where these linkages are less understood and development challenges are multifaceted. In this context, this paper aims to evaluate potential synergies and trade-offs among selected SDGs and their associated targets in Nepal in a linear pairwise comparison. Synergies and trade-offs related to climate action (SDG 13), access to energy (SDG 7), sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12), and life on land (SDG 15) have been evaluated using historical data for the period from 1990 to 2018 employing a mixed methods approach. Network analysis to map the conceptual linkages between the SDGs and their targets was combined with the advance sustainability analysis (ASA) to quantitatively evaluate the synergy and trade-offs between SDGs. The results illustrate the presences of a continual trade-off between emission reductions targets of SDG 13 with per capita energy consumption and share of renewable energy of SDG 7, land use for agricultural production target of SDG 12, and forest area target of SDG 15. This indicates that climate action is strongly interlinked with GHG emissions from economic activities and energy consumption. The results of the study represent a valuable input for the policy makers, supporting coherent and sustainable development planning as Nepal plans to graduate to a middle-income country.",https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/1/566/pdf,,SDG 13: Climate Action

However, there are recognized overlaps and tensions between mitigation, adaptation and development, and between top-down and community-based approaches to adaptation. This paper explores the approaches used to develop Local Adaptation Plans of Action (LAPAs) by three different programmes in the forest sector of Nepal. The analysis of information drawn from 37 interviews, with government, non-government and community representatives at national, district and local levels, shows that although the LAPAs in Nepal are prepared with limited external and scientific contribution, they are rich with local information. However, the limited knowledge and capacity of local people in relation to specific climate change impacts and potential solutions mean the plans bear little difference to regular development activities. Nearly all the activities identified contributed to adaptation and mitigation, as well as economic development, within a context of environmental sustainability, but appeared not to address the social equity and justice aspects of social sustainability. Moreover, this article argues that the community has greater confidence in plans prepared when donor funding is channelled through existing government mechanisms than through more directly donor funded approaches. It may continue to be necessary to keep adaptation plans separate from development plans until there is a greater understanding of the means to and need for adaptation as part of mainstream development planning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17565529.2019.1586634,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Thus, it is imperative to understand the perception of rice seed growers towards climate change and identify the major adaptation strategies against climate change along with their significant determinants. In this light, our study used data from 223 rice seed growers in the Chitwan district of Nepal using purposive sampling followed by simple random sampling from Bharatpur Metropolitan City and Madi Municipality. Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate perception and adaptation strategies. The growers were categorized as adopters or non-adopters of strategies using the adoption index. Probit regression was used to determine the significant determinants of the adoption of strategies. The findings revealed that 71% of growers perceived climate change: increased temperature and decreased frequency of rainfall. Varietal selection, green manuring, planting time, improved water management and nutrient management were the major adaptation strategies adopted in the study area. From the regression analysis, years of formal education, experience, contact with extension agents and training were found to be significant determinants of the adoption of strategies. The farmers of Madi were found to be more likely to adopt the adaptation strategies. It is therefore recommended that the local and provincial-level governments explore the institutional service provision system and socio-economic characteristics while considering the location for better farm-level adoption of strategies. The study is useful for policymakers to deliberately target formal education, extension services and training for increased adoption of adaptation strategies in the face of climate change.

The results show that farm input prices and output prices play a crucial role in determining acreage allocation. While the variation in daily temperature during planting season affects acreage allocations for all crops except wheat, the total precipitation is critical for upland crops, particularly for millet. Literacy rate and the number of rainy days significantly affect yield for most crops. Moreover, the rising winter warming is enhancing wheat and potato yields. The results also show that a ten percent decrease in the number of rainy days during the growing season is likely to reduce yields for rice, maize, and wheat by 4.8, 1.7, and 0.8 percent, respectively.",https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/6/2/32/pdf,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Here, 26 climate extreme indices of temperature (13) and precipitation (13) as recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) were calculated using RClimDex software for 90 meteorological stations. Then the statistical significance of the long-term trend of the indices was tested using the Mann-Kendall method, and true magnitude of the trend was identified utilizing Sensâ slope method for each index at each station. Overall, the hot (warm days, warm nights, summer days, tropical nights, and warm spells) and cold (cold days, cold nights, cold spells) extreme indices show significant positive and negative trends respectively. However, extreme precipitation indices also show an increasing trend, but the statistical significance and spatial coherence is low. Extreme temperatures increased more in the Mountain and Himalayan regions than the other regions. Extreme wet day precipitation events are significantly increasing in far western region, adjoining areas of mid-western and western Siwalik though Mountain regions and then again in the central and eastern Mountains and Himalayan regions.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/tgb/article/download/34262/26949,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Given that the countrywide assessment of such extremes is still lacking, we present a comprehensive picture of prevailing precipitation extremes observed across Nepal. First, we present the spatial distribution of daily extreme precipitation indices as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection, Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI) from 210 stations over the period of 1981â2010. Then, we analyze the temporal changes in the computed extremes from 76 stations, featuring long-term continuous records for the period of 1970â2012, by applying a non-parametric MannâKendall test to identify the existence of a trend and Senâs slope method to calculate the true magnitude of this trend. Further, the local trends in precipitation extremes have been tested for their field significance over the distinct physio-geographical regions of Nepal, such as the lowlands, middle mountains and hills and high mountains in the west (WL, WM and WH, respectively), and likewise, in central (CL, CM and CH) and eastern (EL, EM and EH) Nepal. Our results suggest that the spatial patterns of high-intensity precipitation extremes are quite different to that of annual or monsoonal precipitation. Lowlands (Terai and Siwaliks) that feature relatively low precipitation and less wet days (rainy days) are exposed to high-intensity precipitation extremes. Our trend analysis suggests that the pre-monsoonal precipitation is significantly increasing over the lowlands and CH, while monsoonal precipitation is increasing in WM and CH and decreasing in CM, CL and EL. On the other hand, post-monsoonal precipitation is significantly decreasing across all of Nepal while winter precipitation is decreasing only over the WM region. Both high-intensity precipitation extremes and annual precipitation trends feature eastâwest contrast, suggesting significant increase over the WM and CH region but decrease over the EM and CM regions. Further, a significant positive trend in the number of consecutive dry days but significant negative trend in the number of wet (rainy) days are observed over the whole of Nepal, implying the prolongation of the dry spell across the country. Overall, the intensification of different precipitation indices over distinct parts of the country indicates region-specific risks of floods, landslides and droughts. The presented findings, in combination with population and environmental pressures, can support in devising the adequate region-specific adaptation strategies for different sectors and in improving the livelihood of the rural communities in Nepal.",https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/5/1/4/pdf,,SDG 13: Climate Action

The findings indicate that both men and women perceive the change if it was easily noticeable. Therefore, a critical understanding of the association of other socio-economic and ecological factors on the construction of perception to climate change would be necessary to form a successful climate change adaptation policy.

Seventeen different precipitation indices are computed using daily precipitation data based on gauge-based observations and climate models. Along with absolute extreme precipitation indices, such as maximum 1-day, maximum consecutive 3-day, 5-day, and 7-day precipitation amounts, this study also computes the contribution of such instances to the annual precipitation. The selected precipitation indices not only allow for the analyses of heavy precipitation-related extremes but also guide the evaluation of agricultural productivity and drought indications, such as consecutive dry and wet days (CDD and CWD). The number of wet days and average precipitation during those wet days, along with the information of the number of days with daily precipitation â¥ 10, 20, 50, and 100 mm, summarize the distribution of total precipitation. This study emphasizes changing precipitation patterns by looking at these indices over the present and future periods. Observations and climate models show a changing nature of precipitation over Nepal. However, different climate models exhibit a different severity of changes. Though the yearly precipitation amount is not altered noticeably, this study finds that the extremes are expected to alter significantly than the averages.

The livelihoods of communities in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region are closely linked with the cryosphere. But over the past few decades, communities in the region have experienced multiple changes, including those driven by climat e change, with direct and immediate impacts on their lives and livelihoods. In this study, we explore linkages between the cryosphere and high-mountain livelihoods using a socialâecological system approach. It examines how the complex socialâecological system in villages in Langtang Valley, Nepal, has evolved in response to both cryospheric and socioeconomic changes. The local communities perceive gradual but significant changes in the cryospheric system, such as receding and thinning glaciers, changing snowfall patterns, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, and a growing incidence of cryosphere-related hazards, such as avalanches and landslides. Communities in the Langtang Valley are also facing a number of socioeconomic changes, resulting in changing aspirations, particularly among the youth. The growing disconnection between society and the surrounding cryosphere, with direct impacts on the transfer and growth of local knowledge systems, are discussed. These simultaneous changes in the cryosphere and the socioeconomic domain have also resulted in a homogenization of livelihood sources, with tourism emerging as the dominant source of livelihood. This has resulted in a dependence of the local population on food imported from outside the valley. A growing dependence on tourism for livelihoods, dependence on imports for food and other basic needs, and the lack of a risk reduction strategy might pose great risks for local lives and livelihoods in the long run. Interventions pertaining to diversifying livelihoods, harmonizing social capital, and hazard risk assessment are essential for strengthening linkages between cryosphere and the socioeconomic system.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1674927820301027,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Using the climate futures (CF) framework, projected changes in annual total precipitation and average minimum/maximum temperature from the RCMs are classified into 18 CF matrices for two representative concentration pathways (RCPs: 4.5/8.5), three future time frames (2021â2045/2046â2070/2071â2095), three geographic regions (mountains/hills/plains) and three representative CF (lowârisk/consensus/highârisk). Ten plausible CF scenario ensembles were identified to assess future water availability in Karnali basin, the headwaters of the Ganges. Comparison of projections for the three regions with literature shows that spatial disaggregation possible using RCMs is important, as local values are often higher with higher variability than values for South Asia. Characterization of future climate using raw and biasâcorrected data shows that RCM projections vary most between mountain and Tarai plains with increasing divergence for higher future and RCPs. Warmer temperatures, prolonged monsoon and sporadic rain events even in drier months are likely across all regions. Highest fluctuations in precipitation are projected for the hills and plains while highest changes in temperature are projected for the mountains. Trends in change in annual average discharge for the scenarios vary across the basin with both precipitation and temperature change influencing the hydrological cycle. CF matrices provide an accessible and simplified basis to systematically generate applicationâspecific plausible climate scenario ensembles from all available RCMs for a rigorous impact assessment.",https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2Fjoc.6327,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Primary data collected through household survey of 600 households, 100 from each district in Morang, Sarlahi, Bara, Chitwan, Rupandehi and Banke were analyzed using logistic regression technique. Results showed that western Terai dummy and family size were negatively affecting the adoption of forage and fodder production.

The long term climate change vulnerability household surveys from 2014 baseline data to 2016, 2017 and 2019 data were analysed in this study. This study adapted IPCC (2001) methodology i.e. also used by C4 EcoSolutions on their baseline climate change vulnerability assessment. This is a bottom-up, integrative approach that considers both physical and social dimensions at a local level. Consequently, vulnerability is best understood as a function of three components: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Exposure to climate change vulnerability is calculated with sum of changes in temperature, changes in rainfall patterns, changes in rainfall intensity, drought episodes and flooding events. Sensitivity is calculated based on slope failures, soil fertility, changes in natural environment (i) soil cover; ii) levels of river sedimentation; iii) water salinity; iv) river ecosystems; v) forest size; and vi) the presence of invasive species), economic dependency level, irrigation facilities and livelihood sources. The major finding is that Chiti has been facing climate change since last decade and it is found severely vulnerable due to climate change. There is an urgent need of improvement on climate change adaptive capacity which could result of awareness, information on climate change and adaptation, surplus production and change in agricultural practices. The present study has used awareness score based on conceptual awareness, experiential awareness, and engagement of household to talk about climate change and adaptation.

Primary data on crop production system were collected through household surveys and adaptation practices in crop production were collected through focus group discussions, key informantsâ interviews, and direct observations. Time series data on key climatic variables and productivity of major crops were collected from the government sources. MannâKendall trend analysis and Senâs Slope methods were used for the analysis and quantification of temperature and rainfall trends. Spearmanâs rank correlation analysis was performed to find the relation of seasonal rainfall with the crop yields.

The study used five indices to assess extreme precipitation under climate change. Precipitation output of two Global Climate Models (GCMs) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Six (CMIP6) were used to characterize the future precipitation extremes during the rainfall season from June to September (JJAS) and overall days of the year. To characterize extreme precipitation events, we used daily precipitation under the SSP2â4.5 and SSP5â8.5 scenarios from the Beijing Climate Center and China Meteorological Administration, China; and Meteorological Research Institute (MRI), Japan. Considering large uncertainties with GCM outputs and different downscaling (including bias correction) methods, direct use of GCM outputs were made to find change in precipitation pattern for future climate. For 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-year return periods, observed and projected 24 h and 72 h annual maximum time series were used to calculate the return level. The result showed an increase in simple daily intensity index (SDII) in the near future (2021â2040) and far future (2081â2100), with respect to the base-year (1995â2014). Similarly, heavy precipitation days (R50 mm), very heavy precipitation days (R100 mm), annual daily maximum precipitation (RX1day), and annual three-day maximum precipitation (RX3day) indices demonstrated an increase in extreme precipitation toward the end of the 21st century. A comparison of R50 mm and R100 mm values showed an extensive (22.6% and 63.8%) increase in extreme precipitation days in the near future and far future. Excessive precipitation was forecasted over Kaski, Nawalparasi East, Syangja, and the western half of the Tanahun region. The expected increase in extreme precipitation may pose a severe threat to the long-term viability of social infrastructure, as well as environmental health. The findings of these studies will provide an opportunity to better understand the origins of severe events and the ability of CMIP6 model outputs to estimate anticipated changes.

Bangladesh is affected by torrential rain, glacier melt, upstream water flow and tidal surges. In 1988, Bangladesh experienced one of the most severe floods of the twentieth century which aroused significant concern internationally and triggered the Bangladesh Action Plan for Flood Control. The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has so far constructed a number of flood shelters and carried out 482 water and flood control projects involving flood protection embankments, drainage channels, sluice gates and regulators on different rivers and canals. These also provided safety measures against inundation by tidal waves, storm-surges and flooding. The Terai region of Nepal is highly prone to hydrological risks including torrential rain, floods, glaciers resulting in erosion and landslides. The Government of Nepal (GON) has implemented different mitigation measures mainly early warning awareness, rescue measure, relief, and post-flood rehabilitation programs etc. Disaster Management Bureaus of both the countries have already conducted many trainings, workshops and seminars to disseminate scientific knowledge and coping up practices to disaster managers and to create public awareness. Besides the contemporary approaches to mitigating flood effects, people of these countries have coped with floods through generations relying on traditional/indigenous knowledge and other local adaptation practices. It is crucial that along with scientific process, indigenous, traditional and conventional practices are to be integrated for a national and regional policy and this should be achieved through a participatory process that engages policy makers and relevant stakeholders.

The farmers need material support, technology as well as farmers group organization in order to increase the profit and to mitigate the risk from climate change and climate variability. The study found that value chain of vegetable farming has benefits in terms of social, economic and environmental aspects.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/EJON/article/download/35931/28090,,SDG 13: Climate Action

With just 0.4% of the total global population and emitting only 0.025 % of total greenhouse gas emissions, Nepal is disproportionately affected by climate change and is listed as the fourth most climate-vulnerable country in the world as per the global climate risk index. The loss of lives due to climate-induced disasters within a decade (2001 â 2010) and in 2023 alone is reported to be more than 4000 and 393 people respectively causing an economic loss of USD 5.34 billion and 2.89 billion respectively. Since Nepal lacks institutional and technical capacity and financial resources to tackle the impacts of climate change, the pursuit of robust climate diplomacy is called for âto shape and reframe the core national interest at home and influence deliberations abroadâ.

Although significant numbers of studies have already explored the interrelationship between biodiversity, ecosystem services and climate change more focused studies have now begun to appear with the goal of investigating and analyzing the negative consequences of climate change on life support systems. This review paper discusses the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and redirects how these losses of biological species on earth have affected and will continue to have effects on the delivery chain of ecosystem services. Concluding section of this paper spotlights on possible mitigation and adaptation plan of actions which contributes in minimizing climate change induced risks while supporting biodiversity and thus the entire ecosystem services. The timeliness of this review is evident because the concerns regarding the potential impacts of global climate change on species and ecosystem services are widely and seriously recognized as major threat of our time.HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 20Page: 41-48",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/16488/13410,,SDG 13: Climate Action

However, in the agricultural sector, and particularly in least developed countries (LDCs), concerns remain as to whether these policies and programmes are consistent with farmersâ preferences. This study empirically investigates Nepalese farmersâ willingness to support the implementation of adaptation programmes. To this end, we first developed suggested adaptation programmes in accordance with the adaptation measures identified by LDCs in their National Adaptation Programmes of Actions. We then employed a choice experiment framework to estimate farmersâ willingness to pay (WTP) for adaptation benefits. The findings indicate that the substantial benefits of the adaptation programmes for farmers result in a sizeable WTP to participate, which would appear to justify the programmesâ widespread implementation.Key policy insights Farmers are willing to participate in, and contribute to, the suggested adaptation programmes in the form of increased access to climate adaptive crop species and varieties, improved soil quality and irrigation and the provision of training in climate adaptive farming.Key socio-economic factors influence farmersâ support of adaptation programmes. Older farmers, those households closer to government extension services, larger land holders, those involved in household labour exchange, farmers located in drought and flood-prone regions and those who perceive that the climate has changed are more likely to participate.The more farmers are aware of climate change impacts, the greater their preference for adaptation programmes. Increasing farmer awareness prior to implementation of such programmes is therefore an obvious means of further raising participation rates.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14693062.2017.1389688,,SDG 13: Climate Action

A comparison of crop productivity between farms employing autonomous adaptations and those not adopting provides an empirical means of resolving this question. This study assesses the climate change adaptation practices used by rice farmers in the Tanahun district of Nepal, their impact on rice productivity, and the factors that affect farmers' decisions to adopt adaptation practices. Adaptation practices used by rice farmers include adjustment in timing of farm operations, selection of varieties, crop rotation, improved irrigation, and fertilizer management. Rice productivity was found to be significantly higher among adopting farmers compared to non-adopting farmers. The findings further suggest that age of the household head, family size, migration of family members outside their village, number of plots under rice cultivation, land holding, and farmers' access to information on climate change all influence farmers' adaptation decisions. This study provides empirical evidence indicating the need for policy makers to take into consideration autonomous adaptations when designing planned adaptations against likely impacts of climate change.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17565529.2018.1469965,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Emerging evidence indicates that various non-price factors such as lack of knowledge, trust in institutions, beliefs, and perceptions about climate change partly explain the low uptake. This study uses the CVM approach to investigate the effect of one such factor â farmersâ climate change perceptions â on the adoption of weather index micro-insurance. We introduce two hypothetical weather index microinsurance products to farming households in Nepal: the first one (basic) insures paddy only, whereas the second one (comprehensive) also insures livestock. We use bivariate probit models with order effects for empirical estimation. We find that householdsâ ex ante perception of future climate change as well as their ex-post perceptions of past climate change impacts have significant effects on their microinsurance purchase decisions. Mean WTP-values for the basic and comprehensive products are NRs. 3096 and NRs. 13209 respectively. We also find some evidence of crowding-out effects on private risk transfer markets by other public and donor climate adaptation programmes. Our findings suggest that public policies should focus on increasing climate awareness, accountability and the development of competitive microinsurance markets.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17565529.2021.1949574,,SDG 13: Climate Action

Western Nepal currently holds significant potential as multiple opportunities for water development within the country are underway. However, it is also identified as one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, with both an increase in the occurrence of natural disasters and exacerbated severity and impacts levels. Regional climate model (RCM) projections indicate warmer weather with higher variability in rainfall for this region. This paper combines bio-physical and social approaches to further study and understand the current climate shocks and responses present in Western Nepal. Data was collected from 3660 households across 122 primary sampling units across the Karnali, Mahakali and Mohana River basins along with focus group discussions, which provided a rich understanding of the currently perceived climatic shocks and related events. Further analysis of climatology was carried out through nine indices of precipitation and temperature that were found to be relevant to the discussed climate shocks. Results show that 79% of households reported experiencing at least one type of climate shock in the five-year period and the most common occurrence was droughts, which is also supported by the climate data. Disaggregated results show that perception varies with the region and among the basins. Analysis of climatic trends further show that irregular weather is most common in the hill region, although average reported frequency of irregular weather is higher in the mountain. Further analysis into the severity and response to climatic shocks suggest an imminent need for better adaptation strategies. This studyâs results show that a vast majority of respondents lack proper access to knowledge and that successful adaptation strategies must be adapted to specific regions to meet communitiesâ local needs.",https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/7/7/92/pdf,,SDG 13: Climate Action
