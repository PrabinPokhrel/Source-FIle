The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model.

Is it necessary to establish carbon futures trading in China? The authorities have endorsed the idea since 2015, however, the scheme has not yet started; no antecedent pre-assessment quantitative research has been carried out. Therefore this study that attempts to fill this gap in the literature, could be of real significance. Through deriving a potential decarbonization roadmap, this study tries to give some clues pertaining to the converted mitigation strategy imposed by carbon futures trading in China. A model chain has been proposed, which is composed of the Optimal Production Decision-making Model for Producers, Life Cycle Impact Assessment, Monetization, and Genetic Algorithm based optimization, to quantify the environmental benefits (including improvements to human health, ecosystem damage and increased temperature induced GDP losses) of the assumed mitigation trajectories. By setting the maximization of environmental benefits as the objective, the optimal decarbonization roadmap with carbon futures trading is derived. Results show that the optimal emission reductions for power enterprises (covered by the carbon market) for the next 10 years (2021–2030) are around 3.27 billion tonnes CO2e. If 36% of this amount is assigned to previously discussed mitigation trajectories, it is found that 106.98 GW ultra-super critical units, 160.85 GW mono-Si PV facilities and 167.26 GW doubly-fed induction generator wind capacity should be installed. Overall environmental benefits are 4.6 trillion CNY2018, over 5% of China’s 2018 GDP. Results demonstrate the optimal emission reductions and potential decarbonization roadmap for China’s power enterprises (those covered by the carbon market) under the context of carbon futures trading, which can be an important reference for the authorities and therefore encourage the establishment of the scheme.",,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

The experiences gathered from Irrigation Sector Projects implemented under various donor agencies such as the World Bank (WB), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and UN/ILO have shown that successful irrigation projects must be defined and planned according to specific ecological regions and pertinent to the local environment. An integrated development approach considers the land use, roads, market, and other economic activities as they relate to prospects for poverty alleviation. Land evaluation and subsequent land use planning according to the soil, climate, land profile, and suitability of agriculture practices should be considered in the development works to ensure true benefit to the rural populations. The integrated approach as such will provide long term sustainability through environmentally sound practices. This approach has been widely applied in the European countries, Korea, Japan, and Sri Lanka.This paper primarily focuses on the irrigation and development approaches most suitable to Nepal’s three ecological regions. High mountain regions should be developed with pasture land, horticulture, organic vegetable farming, and tourism. Irrigation technology in these areas should be simple pipe conveyance, and tank irrigation. In the mid-hills horticulture on the sloping terrain and cereal crops in the river valleys with other diversified cropping systems should be applied. The Terai region is the ‘Bread Basket’ of Nepal, and has high potential for diversified agriculture and industrial development.For development in these regions to succeed, road networks and transportation facilities are essential to economic growth. Road transportation maximizes opportunity for tourism and other economic activities. Development work must be planned in an integrated approach, which should be based on appropriate land use patterns for environmentally sustainable practices. An ideal solution would be to envision the watershed as the unit for eco-friendly sustainable development planning involving all the stakeholders under the watershed purview. As an example, the principles of Integrated Water Resources Management Planning (IWRMP), and Integrated Watershed Management Plan (IWMP) have been successfully applied in the USA and Australia (Box 1). It has illustrated that vegetative covered catchment stores large amount of rain water, increases groundwater table, reduces erosion of soil, and lastly decreases the intensity of flood hazard. Whereas, the naked catchment areas are highly erodible, does not store rain water, susceptible to high erosion and landslides, and increases the flood intensity by three fold than a vegetative covered one. The vegetative cover increases the water resources availability for over all development for agriculture.                               HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 20Page: 31-40",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/16486/13409,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Qualitative plankton samples were collected by towing 55μm mesh hydrobios plankton nets just below the water surface for five minutes at each sampling station. Quantitative samples, on the other hand, were collected by filtering 100 litres of water fetched with a bucket through a 55μm mesh hydrobios net.

However, there is a widespread view that young men and women are becoming more at ease in each other's company and beginning sexual experiences prior to marriage, putting them at risk of the consequences of unsafe sex. This research aims to evaluate the factors associated with premarital sexual behavior and its consequences among Nepalese college-going adolescents and youths. This cross-sectional web-based study included 415 Nepalese students over the age of 18 who were enrolled in a bachelor's degree program in a discipline other than health science. Data was collected from students online using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Pearson's chi-square (χ2) and logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between the independent and outcome variables. Most participants (61.7%) had dating experience and 21.2% had premarital sex. About three-fourths (76.1%) of participants had premarital sex before the age of 20 years and the ages of sexual debut ranged from 13 to 25 years. The major reasons for sexual debut were desire, curiosity, continuation of love relationship, and peer pressure. One-third of students (33.0%) reported having more than two sex partners, and 11.4% had intercourse with commercial sex workers. Among students who had premarital sex, 13.7% of participants or their sex partners, had to undergo abortions because of unintended pregnancies. Having an illiterate parent (AOR=11.0; 95% CI=2.01-60.87), high pocket money (AOR=4.2; 95% CI=1.1-16.2), increased dating culture (AOR=18.8; 95% CI=4.8-74.2), a close friend who has experienced premarital sex (AOR=5.2; 95% CI=2.21-12.21), and exposure to pornography (AOR=97.87; 95% CI= 9.5-10001.4) were predictors of premarital sex among Nepalese college students.

This study investigated energy balance and environmental impact of rice and wheat production systems in terms of energy ratio, impact of energy inputs to the crop yield and CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions under terai and hill geographical regions of Nepal. Primary data were collected from 139 randomly selected farms by using structured questionnaire. The results revealed that the total energy consumption in rice and wheat production were 9.70 GJ/hm2 (terai) to 11.78 GJ/hm2 (hill) and 8.40 GJ/hm2 (hill) to 10.95 GJ/hm2 (terai), respectively. The energy balance of rice and wheat production were found 46.33 GJ/hm2 (hill) to 59.29 GJ/hm2 (terai) and 27.14 GJ/hm2 (terai) to 38.52 GJ/hm2 (hill), respectively, where energy use efficiency in terai and hill were found to be 7.14 and 4.97 in rice, and 3.49 and 5.59 in wheat, respectively. The contribution of fertilizer on impacts was significant among other energy inputs in rice and wheat production in both geographical regions. The CO2e emissions from rice and wheat were higher by 52% and 78% in hill as compared to respective crop rice (1786 kg CO2e/hm2) and wheat (843 kg CO2e/hm2) in terai. This study showed that rice production system in terai is more energy and environmentally efficient, whilst wheat production in hill is more energy efficient.

The purpose of this study was to find out nature of accidents happening in the cement industry, their causes and recommend appropriate approaches to prevent the accidents. For this study, 10 cement industries were visited to collect the data of accident that occurred in last three fiscal years. Among the 10 visited cement industries, three were limestone-based industries and seven were clinker based industries. It was found that in the last three fiscal years, almost all accidents were minor accidents while only few were major and no fatal accidents. The data showed that the number of accidents is decreasing each year, however the decrease number is not significantly different. The surface causes of accidents in the industry were due to worker’s taking shortcut, being over confident in themselves, poor/lack of housekeeping, starting task without getting necessary information, neglecting safety procedures, being mentally distracted, lack of preparation for work, mishandling of machinery, manual material handling, lack of proper and suitable PPE and occupational stress. Beside these, the root cause of the accidents in cement industries is lack of integration of safety plan, policy and safety culture into each activities of the industry.

Development of hydropower project in most economical way possible is the first prerequisite to get maximum benefit from harnessing water resources. The maximum benefit can be achieved only through optimal design of the project. Each project component must be designed considering the required level of factor of safety, performance standards of each component and economy. On this backdrop, this paper intends to optimize the location of cutoffs in headworks to get maximum benefits from use of it in terms of safety and economy.Improper placement of cutoff not only reduces the factor of safety against piping but also curtails the project benefits due to excessive seepage flow. Piping (internal erosion of soil particles under structure) is associated with high exit gradient. It threatens the structural stability and ultimately leads to failure of structure while as excessive seepage flow limits the availability of flow for power generation and reduces the project benefits. So, the optimal design of headworks is an attempt to identify the best location of cutoff to control seepage flow and reduce exit gradient. Five different cases representing different location of cutoff were analyzed and their roles in controlling seepage flow and reducing exit gradient was evaluated to optimize the cutoff location. 2D Finite Element Method (FEM) was used for the seepage analysis. The analysis showed that cutoffs are essential to control seepage flow when dam/weir is founded in pervious soil. However, the best location to place cutoff must be adroitly identified to reap maximum benefit from use of cutoff. The analysis reveals that the role of central cutoff in controlling seepage flow and reducing exit gradient is very limited. Likewise, the u/s cutoff has minimum effect in reducing exit gradient but the d/s cutoff seemed very effective in reducing exit gradient resulting increased factor of safety against piping. Hence, this paper concludes that the d/s end is the optimal location to place cutoff to improve safety and economy of the project. In addition, the use of both u/s and d/s cutoffs extend positive roles both in controlling seepage flow and reducing exit gradient. However, in author’s opinion the construction cost of two cutoffs must be compared with benefit added by use of two cutoffs over use of single d/s cutoff.  HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 21, July, 2017Page: 42-44Upload Date: July 18, 2017",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/17820/14466,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

While the power sector is entirely dependent on hydropower, other sectors depend on fossil fuel imports from India. This study offers a pathway for energy independency, energy for all and transition towards a 100% renewables based energy system. The modelling of the energy sector is done using the LUT Energy System Transition model for a period from 2015 to 2050 in a 5-year time step. This study covers the main energy sectors: power, heat, and transport. Two scenarios are visualised, one considering greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and the associated mitigation cost and another without these costs, though both scenarios aim at achieving a high share of renewable energy by 2050. A substantial drop in levelised cost of energy is observed for the scenario without GHG emission cost, however, taxing GHG emissions will accelerate the energy transition with the levelised cost of energy on a similar level. It is well possible to transition from 90 €/MWh in 2015 to 49 €/MWh by 2050 for the entire energy system by utilizing indigenous low-cost renewable energy. Solar photovoltaics and hydropower will play a dominant role in 2050, having a share of 67% and 31% respectively. Consequently, this leads to zero GHG emissions.

We recorded two types of supply chain: (ⅰ) open supply chain, driven by open market, where the product is transported to Kathmandu before export to international market, and (ⅱ) close chain practiced by indigenous Shauka community following customary trade route to Tibet. The open chain is longer with higher number of actors compared to the close chain. This study observed that actors have intensive horizontal competition in the open chain to collect and purchase maximum quantity. Therefore, profit is disproportionately distributed to the actors in higher level of the supply chain. The profit is based on the price the actor receives, which is determined by their bargaining power. An actor's bargaining power is determined by the capital holding capacity, market information, risk appetite, networking and social ties. The study suggests that Government's interventions such as providing security to traders, access to finance, organizing auction and providing market information can help to increase the bargaining power of lower level actors.

Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 385 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics of Gandaki Medical College starting from May 2021 to July 2021, by using self- administered questionnaire. The data was analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences version 21.0 and descriptive statistics were computed. Results: More than four‐fifths respondents were aware about COVID‐19. Half of them thought it transmits via human touch. One-fourth of them mentioned that delivery at the hospital during COVID-19 pandemic was unsafe. Almost half of them regretted conceiving, among which one quarter thought of aborting their fetus, half of them were against breastfeeding, and three-forth had regular antenatal care checkups. Majority of them took precautions to stay safe, where half of them responded that they would not breast fed baby if they got infected. Conclusions: Majority of the study population have good knowledge, attitude, and practice of COVID-19 disease. However, it is worrisome that some respondents thought of terminating her pregnancy, and some were unable to visit the hospital for routine antenatal care checkups and didn’t have proper knowledge about breastfeeding their child.

This study aims to assess the barriers to safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on building construction projects in Nepal. A total of 330 responses were collected from construction professionals in Nepal using a Likert scale. To ensure the data's suitability for factor analysis using Principal Component Analysis, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, Bartlett's Sphericity test, inter-component correlations, and Cronbach alpha scores for internal consistency were checked, and principal components were extracted. A 25-item safety barrier to safety measures in building construction projects during the COVID-19 pandemic was identified through an extensive review of the literature; six components were retained using Principal Component Analysis which represented the model of choice and explained 62.86 % of the data variance. The components were; inappropriate safety guidelines, psychological working pressure, inadequate hygiene monitoring and control, lack of safety awareness, improper working culture, and insufficient planning and scheduling. The internal consistency for the retained components was high; Cronbach α scores ranged from 0.72 to 0.796. “Inappropriate Safety Guidelines” was the most critical barrier to implementing safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in building construction projects, according to the rankings of the six identified components. It is recommended that construction professionals and regulatory bodies prioritize the development and adherence to robust safety protocols tailored to pandemic conditions. Regularly updating and reinforcing these guidelines will be crucial in safeguarding the health and well-being of workers while ensuring project continuity.

Although several initiatives are presently being carried out to find alternatives to petroleum, it is of the utmost importance for Nepal to be ready with distinct long-term and short-term strategies according to its circumstances as soon as feasible. When discussing the possibility of replacing the use of petroleum with that of alternative resources, it is necessary to discuss these possibilities in relation to certain countries because the possibilities for displacement vary from country to country. In this article, a comparative analysis of the usage, importance, and displacement of petroleum in Nepal is discussed. In addition, a full evaluation of the energy situation in Nepal has been presented, along with a discussion of the potential solutions that may be put into place in order to solve the issues that have surfaced. This paper discusses seven factors that motivate Nepal to displace petroleum and eight potential actions that can be taken to accomplish that goal. The main goal of this article is to look at the many ways Nepal could lessen its reliance on petroleum and move closer to finding good alternatives.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2211467X23000032,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

A wide range of decentralized electricity systems has been used to power remote parts of Nepal. How these systems facilitate the adoption of electronic appliances, is a question under explored in the existing energy policy literature. This study bridges this gap by comparing the electronic appliance adoption among households that use micro-hydropower and solar home systems against traditional lighting solutions and grid electricity in Nepal. Applying the two-stage least-square method to data from Nepal's population and household census of 2011, we found solar home systems do not increase the use of high-wattage electronic appliances such as televisions and fridges when compared to kerosene, but micro-hydro plants and grid electricity do. This finding indicates that low-capacity electricity sources like solar home systems appear to be limited to facilitate the adoption of high-wattage electronic appliances. It is recommended that energy access policies should look beyond providing basic access to electricity for lighting and prioritize the provisioning of electricity sources that support the use of high-wattage electricity appliances.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0301421523001611,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

However, simple administrative rules might not fully account for economic geography, resulting in lower subsidies for remote areas. Using regression analysis on a rich dataset of adoption, cost and subsidy for about 4000 Nepalese Village Development Committees over 22 years, we show that administratively determined lumpsum subsidies disproportionately hurt remote communities. Simulations show that adjusting the subsidy spatially to reflect the geographic cost of living, can increase clean technology adoption. Thus, spatial targeting of subsidies is key to accelerating energy access in remote settings such as the Hindu Kush Himalaya.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/ac9458/pdf,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Instead, we focus on the meaning of energy justice in the context of unconventional energy systems, by investigating small-scale bioenergy development in Nepal. We approach energy justice as a conceptual framework that focuses on social justice implications of energy systems, with an emphasis on burden/benefit distributions and procedural or post-distributive justice, and consider its applicability beyond conventional energy systems. Research was carried out in two parallel phases: (1) a quantitative phase, based on spatial analysis of secondary data, explores bioenergy distribution in Nepal, in relation to social-demographic characteristics, to investigate processes of distributive justice, and (2) a qualitative phase, based on thematic analysis of primary interview data, looks at post-distributive aspects of the energy reality in Nepal, to critically discuss the meaning of energy justice in this context. 1) Biogas development is unevenly distributed, following patterns of social connectedness, which suggests significant spatial variation in capabilities or capability deprivations regarding individual agency in relation to (bio)energy. 2) There is a surprising inconsistency in the relationship between socially marginalised populations and attainment of biogas across the country, which needs further research. 3) Individual agency, supported or facilitated by enabling actors—particularly local biogas companies—is a key characteristic of local biogas development. 4) Decentralised, small-scale energy development gives rise to power dynamics differing fundamentally from those of conventional centralised energy systems, through radically different processes of procedural justice. Processes of energy justice are shown to exhibit strong spatial variability and are associated with social connectedness. Analysis focusing on processes of agency and empowerment leads to the conclusion that energy justice, to encourage unconventional energy development, should emphasise the necessary interconnection of individual rights, empowerment and responsibility.",http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13705-017-0111-6.pdf,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

This study applies a random effect logit model for analysing the factors explaining the choice of clean cooking energy and, in particular, the role of ethnicity/caste. To further examine the clean energy gap among different ethnicities and castes, this study applied exogenous switching treatment effect regression (ESTER). The results show that Dalits and Ethnic minorities are less likely to use clean cooking energy and the findings remain the same across all reasonable model specifications. More disaggregated analysis shows that Madheshi Dalit households are worse off, followed by Hill Dalit, Madheshi low-caste, Terai Adivasi, Other ethnic groups, and Hill Chhetri. The results of ESTER show that the difference observed in the use of clean cooking fuels between ethnic minorities and others is better explained by their base heterogeneity effects, while the clean cooking fuel differences between Dalits and non-Dalits are explained by both base heterogeneity and the treatment effects. It means that, unlike non-Dalit ethnic minorities, Dalits faced differential treatment due to their low caste position as well as their low-endowment ownership. Another major finding is that differences in endowment and education level largely explain differences in energy use. Hence, while assessing differences in energy use by caste/ethnic groups, one must control for the endowment and other human capital differences across the households that fall under different income or consumption quantiles. Clean energy policy should focus on improving access to clean energy, and it should pay particular attention to the Dalit communities and, to some extent, non-Dalit minorities by providing easy access and improving their purchasing power by increasing their asset endowment and income.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0140988322002456,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

The use of solid biomass has a detrimental effect on health, exacerbates the burden of biomass collection, and hampers access to clean energy. Understanding the factors influencing the choice of modern cooking fuels is crucial to improving energy security and resilience and easing the transition to clean fuels. This study evaluates technological choices for the transition in cooking energy from the perspective of experts working in the government, non-government, and academia sectors. A structured questionnaire survey was prepared with five criteria and nine cooking technology options. Fifty-one experts responded to the survey, and their responses were analyzed using the analytical hierarchy process. The study reveals that efficiency and capital cost are the primary criteria for selecting cooking technology. The most suitable clean cooking technology is an induction stove followed by a hot plate, while the least preferred technology is a Bayupankhi stove followed by two-pothole mud improved cooking stoves. To ensure the robustness of the method, sensitivity analysis was performed on the two primary criteria efficiency and capital cost of the cooking technology. The analysis revealed robust and consistent rankings of technologies.

Inefficient burning of solid biomass for cooking releases household air pollution that is hazardous to health, while putting pressure on forest resources. This paper provides an overview of the household-cooking-energy transition in Nepal to date. Despite numerous efforts by the government and other actors to speed this transition, energy data spanning the years 2000–18 reveal that ~69% of households nationwide still rely on solid fuels for cooking today. The proportion of solid-fuel users is especially high in rural regions, reaching &gt;80%. Moreover, if the current rate of progress is not accelerated, the use of solid fuels will remain high even in 2030, preventing the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7. Cooking-fuel choices are heavily constrained by accessibility, demographic and socio-economic factors. Thus, this paper recommends that evidence-based and integrated policies and strategies be urgently deployed to foster a more effective and rapid transition towards clean energy, which is critical to achieving SDG 7.",https://academic.oup.com/ce/article-pdf/5/1/1/53681642/zkaa022.pdf,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

More than 2/3rd of energy consumed in Nepal comes from biofuels and waste and about 1/4th of energy consumed comes from coal and petroleum products. With increasing number of motor vehicles and rising demand for cooking gas, Nepal’s coal and petroleum import bills in recent years have reached over Rs. 200 billion. With its vast water resources, Nepal has a great potential for energy independence and sustainability and achieve energy security. Nepal’s current 1,689 MW hydroelectricity capacity is expected to reach over 5,000 MW in next three to five years, which means Nepal will have a large amount of clean energy in the market. This increased hydropower production will also require an increased domestic consumption by making hydroelectricity affordable, reliable, and high-quality energy by improving its distribution system. Nepal also has a very high potential for solar power, which need to be harnessed and brought to the national grid. Nepal needs to harness all energy sources, which consist of hydropower, solar power, wind power, biofuels, and biogas, in a sustainable way for its energy independence and security. Because Nepal is in a geologically active and natural disasters prone area, it is critical to ensure ecological balance of Asta-Ja elements, Nepali letter, Jal (water), Jamin (land), Jungle (forest), Jadibuti (medicinal and aromatic plants), Janashakti (manpower), Janawar (animal), Jarajuri (crop plants) and Jalabayu (climate) while developing energy resources.

Nepal has hitherto adopted an isolated and sectoral silo policy approach to development planning that has remained the dominant mode of planning across many countries in the world with few exceptions until recently when inadequacies of sectoral planning became apparent. The search for alternatively more integrative approaches came into the forefront of development discourse in the backdrop of shrinking natural resources, climate change, inexorable demand of a rapidly growing urban population, and other needs and requirements at a global scale.   The river basin-wide W-E-F-E nexus development policy strategy offers significant potential for optimum water resource utilization driving development of all sectors, including agriculture.

Further, the author raises the question with the government why this project was declared as one of the projects of national pride and was ready for committing to funding beforehand for the preparation of detail design, tender documents and tender drawings in a single package contract along with the feasibility study when the investment decision could only be taken after ascertaining the soundness/ attractiveness of the project on technical, economical, financial and socio-environmental grounds through feasibility and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies. The author also believes that the project could become more attractive if the downstream benefits from flow regulation in existing irrigation project in India could be accounted for and two potential hydroelectric projects in Nepal at the downstream reaches could be implemented first to derive additional power benefits in these two projects from flow regulation. HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water, Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 17, July 2015 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/13267/10702,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

A number of hurdles come across when a potential site has to be exploited, thus, all theoretically and/or technically available potential cannot actually be developed/ exploited. Nepal is not an exception in this respect. Exploitation of run-of-river schemes has much less hurdle in comparison with storage development. The storage development, particularly the larger scale development, has even international implications, because the benefits of such development spread far beyond the national boundary. In the Nepalese case the downstream country, particularly India, is reluctant to recognize the downstream flow regulation benefits arising from flood-control and dry season flow augmentation. As such the current focus of exploitation of Nepalese hydro-potential should be on run-of-river type development and smaller size storage developments which can easily be materialized without much hurdle, but in a coordinated and well scheduled manner in a way not to hamper the larger storage development at the opportune future dates.HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water, Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 19Page:1-5",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/15340/12405,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

So, ownership of land has multi-faceted understanding around the world. For the developing country like Nepal having diverse societal arrangements, land tenure system plays important role in economic, social and political structure. As Nepal is in the process of implementing federalization, assessment of land tenure security shall be one of the instruments for developing new land related policies and assessing the effect of new policies afterward. The objective of this paper is to perform SWOT analysis on the status of land tenure security in Nepal by reviewing the history of the tenure system and current tenure system, studying country reports and research papers and analyzing policies and institutions. The study shows that despite some initiatives by government, NGOs, bilateral agencies and media to improve land tenure security, land tenure insecurity prevails in all areas of the country even in registered lands. It is found that stable  rganization, registration of most of the built-up and cultivated land, advocacy to protect the right of landless has strengthened the land tenure security. However, the tenure rights of socially and economically disadvantaged people and displaced people from disasters have not been properly addressed and those people are at high risk of eviction from the place they are living. The study recommends that land tenure insecurity arising from political, legislative and organizational behavior should be managed by appropriate interventions and policy reforms. As most of the analyses of land tenure security in Nepal have been performed in a descriptive way, this study explicitly investigates the issue through SWOT analysis.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJG/article/download/23005/19537,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Recently some of energy drink has been banned in different countries like Saudi Arabia. In Nepal none of the studies has been done to report the effect of energy drink on health. The main objective of the study was to find out the effect of energy drink on health of medical students. Materials and Methods:  It was a cross sectional questionnaire based study done at Manipal College of Medical Sciences, Pokhara, Nepal on November 2013. Results: Out of 206 students 202 completed the questionnaire completely and their responses were evaluated which gives an overall response rate of 98.05%%. Out of 202 students, 88 (43.56%) students were found consuming energy drinks. The research finding revealed that most of the students who consumed energy drink were male 58%. Most of the students felt energetic after consuming energy drink. The majority of the students were from the second year 79.5%. The majority of the students, 71.6% consumed < 5 cans/week. Among the CNS manifestations students felt energetic, insomnia, euphoria, anxiety, dizziness, hallucination, headache and seizure disorder. Most of the students suffered from palpitation among the CVS manifestations. Other GIT and CVS Manifestations were discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation, weight loss and chest pain. ANS and miscellaneous manifestations were also seen among the students among which increased stamina , micturation, dry mouth, sweating, burning sensation in the throat, allergic reactions, breathlessness were noted by the students. Headache and insomnia was found more prevalent in males [OR 1.836 95% (CI 0.458, 7.367)] and [OR 1.214, 95 %(CI 0.517, 2.852)], respectively as compared to female students. However, in the case of GIT manifestations viz. abdominal pain and constipation revealed that it was more prevalent among male students [OR 2.292, 95 %(CI( 0.343, 13.638)] and [OR 1.836, 95 %(CI 0.458, 7.367)]. Conclusion:  It is concluded that energy drink gives energy and increases the stamina but it produces neurologic, psychiatric, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal complications on health. Further studies are required on the same field to find out its effect on health in Nepalese population. ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/NJE/article/download/12374/10033,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

The modeling tool, Long-range Energy Alternative Planning System (LEAPS) has been used to develop a bottom-up model to estimate the energy demand and environmental emissions in the Kathmandu valley for the period 2016-2030 AD. Besides the Reference scenario, four alternative scenarios (Public Bus Penetration, Improved Fuel Economy, Electric Motorbike and Hybrid Electric Car) have been developed. In the Reference scenario, the cumulative energy demand will reach 142,092 thousand GJ within the analysis period. About 65% of this demand comes from motorbikes and light duty vehicles. If all of the alternative scenarios are implemented together, about 38% of energy demand and 54% of CO2 emission can be avoided compared to the reference scenario within the study period.

Given that Nepal seeks to add several hydropower plants to the Integrated National Power System (INPS) in the next few years, this type of planning is crucial. To explore potential expansion plans, the 48 hydropower plants (20 of which are currently operating) within 18 hydro networks and two diesel plants are included, and different options such as the possibility of export, seasonal variations in hydrology, and projected growth rates in gross domestic product are considered. The results illustrate the long run marginal cost (LRMC) and loss of load probability (LoLP) through 2030 in Nepal. It is found that LRMC is 3.50 Nepali Rupees per kilowatt hour at 4.1% of average LoLP. While scrutinizing the results, it is found that LoLP is higher in early stage of projections due to generation capacity limitations from 2014 to 2016. However, by the end of 2017, the LRMC and LoLP begin to decrease significantly. On this premise, the model suggests to introduce large storage plants for hydropower generation and export of that excess energy. Furthermore, a proper implementation of proposed peaking and storage plants to meet rising demand can offset the need to obtain electricity through more expensive and less environmentally-friendly means such as thermal/diesel plants.HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water, Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 19Page: 45-51",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/15352/12413,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

The idea of Nepal as the asal Hindustan, or “pure land of Hindus” (Stiller 1989, cited under Hindu Monarchy, Polity, and Collapse), was promoted by the political unifier of modern Nepal, Prithvi Narayan Shah, in the eighteenth century but the seeds for this were planted much earlier. Such claims, which persisted well into the modern period, were grounded in the fact that Nepal was geographically and politically isolated, the latter being reinforced by its rulers’ strict policy of isolationism. Nepal thus avoided both Muslim and British rule, which transformed much of the rest of the Indian subcontinent. In contrast, in the oft-quoted words of the French Indologist Sylvain Lévi, Nepal was “India in the making” (Lévi 1905–1908, p. 28, cited under General Overviews). That is, Nepal preserved ancient features of Hindu, Buddhist, and tantric religion that were lost or otherwise transformed elsewhere on the Indian subcontinent. These included animal sacrifice, tantric rituals that abound in the Kathmandu Valley, and the unique syncretism between Hinduism and Buddhism, all of which remain in ample evidence in Nepal today. Historically, Nepal referred only to the Kathmandu Valley and its surrounding environs. This was the domain of the Newars, the indigenous inhabitants of the Valley’s medieval Three Kingdoms (Kathmandu, Lalitpur/Patan, and Bhaktapur). Newars are urban dwellers with their own dual caste system that recognizes a hierarchy for both Newar Hindus and Buddhists, who are not readily categorizable as such because many Newars worship both Hindu and Buddhist deities and participate in a variety of rituals. Newar religion is also strongly influenced by Tantrism and tantric Hindu Śākta (Goddess) elements and practices permeate the Kathmandu Valley, where numerous fierce goddesses figure prominently. In contrast to Newar Hinduism and these tantric influences, there is another form of Hinduism practiced in Nepal known as Parbatiyā Hinduism. Parbatiyā (also known today as Khas-Arya) refers to the Dalit and high-caste Hindus (Brahmins and Kshatriyas, locally known in Nepal as Bahuns and Chetris) who hail from the hills outside of the Kathmandu Valley, often referred to in English nowadays as Hill Hindus. With Gorkha king Prithvi Narayan Shah’s defeat of the Valley in the eighteenth century, Parbatiyā Hindus introduced a more Brahmanical form of Hinduism into Nepal that is derived from and parallels Brahmanical Hindu formations in India. Parbatiyā and Newar forms of Hinduism are neither identical nor entirely distinct. Parbatiyā Hindus and Parbatiyā Hinduism—namely, the ruling elite and their religion, which has been fundamental to legitimating their rule—have hegemonic status in modern Nepal. The declaration of Nepal as a secular republic in 2006 after the collapse of the Hindu monarchy in the aftermath of the Maoist insurgency (1996–2006) affords a new opportunity and lens through which to examine Hinduism in Nepal and its role in Nepali society, culture, and politics moving forward.</p>",,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

This paper explores the effectiveness of gender audits as an approach to mainstreaming in the energy sector which has lagged other sectors in mainstreaming gender. The assessment takes the experiences of an international network on gender and sustainable energy that aims to get gender onto the energy policy agenda. Since there is no standard audit methodology, the network developed its own. The paper uses an analysis of qualitative data, reviews of audit reports and key informant interviews to answer two questions. As a result of gender audits, have gender issues or attending to women's particular interests been incorporated in energy policy? Did participation in an audit build the capacity of national actors to contribute to gender mainstreaming in the energy sector? Detailed data comes from network countries conducting audits: Kenya, Senegal and Nepal, with supporting evidence from 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The gender audit methodology used is partially effective in integrating gender issues into government energy policy. Pragmatic, conceptual and political barriers to gender mainstreaming continue to operate. Adopting gender-aware policies occurs rapidly in organisations that participated in the audits. Male employees more readily accept gender policies when they see that policies also benefits men. In the audit countries, a group of national gender and energy experts has been established able to contribute to mainstreaming gender in the energy sector.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2214629618310077,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

These rivers provide drinking water to the people of these countries. In addition, another option for the benefit to share of these rivers among the stakeholders is to develop hydropower in Nepal and export it to light the cities of the rest of countries.

One can use the model based either in demand side or in supply side. This paper considers electricity as an essential factor of production. Thus it uses the demand side model to reexamine the association and determine the causality between the variables electricity consumption (EC) and gross domestic product (GDP) of five south Asian countries during the period 2000-2011 AD. A panel unit root test, panel co-integration test are used to determine the long run equilibrium. Fully modified ordinary least square method was applied to estimate the panel electricity elasticity coefficient. Granger causality based on Vector Auto Regression model was then applied to determine the direction of causality. The data are found stationary at first difference but are found non-stationary at their level. Co-integration test confirmed the long run relationship or equilibrium between the variables EC and GDP. The electricity elasticity coefficient (EEC) is 1.31. It reveals that a 1% increase in electricity consumption would lead to increase the GDP by 1.31% indicating a highly responsive electricity demand. In the spontaneous process of economic development of south Asian countries, there is a significant impact of EC on GDP. The value of EEC is self-spoken. A large change in GDP would be expected from a small change in EC. It has a big implication of bringing rapid economic progress within a short span of time and any shortage of electric energy would retard economic progress. Electricity consumption is found to Granger cause GDP. This unidirectional causality running from electricity consumption to GDP has important policy implication-electricity consumption leads economic growth which has two policy implications. One, reduction of electricity consumption through bringing domestic energy prices in line with market prices would lead to fall in GDP or employment. Two, electricity consumption bears the burden of short run adjustment to reestablish the long run equilibrium.                                        HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 20Page: 18-22",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/16484/13407,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Women are the backbone of the cooking system, as they mostly manage it. Despite several existing efficient cooking energy systems, households generally do not prefer them. Thus, our aim is to find why this is the case. We estimate the time required and human energy expenditure (HEE) for production of cooking fuel for four alternative cooking energy systems in Nepal, as a case study. The time required to produce cooking fuel for the baseline scenario (i.e. fuelwood and TCS) is 40 h/cap/yr and HEE is 41 MJ/cap/yr. System 2 (charcoal and TCS) has the highest demand for time and HEE. The results suggest that the most efficient system is System 1 (i.e. fuelwood and an improved cookstove (ICS)). However, a woman produces cooking fuel for the whole household, which multiples her time and HEE demand to the household size. This system analysis indicates a significant influence in the selection of cooking fuel due to the HEE and time demand. It concludes that in the future, more importance should be attached to the labour required from women in the cooking energy systems in the development of technological improvements.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0360544219312058,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

The spillover effect of war compelled the countries, mainly European countries and emerging big economies, to focus on alternative sources of energy like nuclear energy and solar energy, as well as coal extraction. Small countries are always in a socio-economic trap due to fear of energy insecurity. The landlocked country of Nepal has already faced an energy crisis and its economic impact. Such a crisis raises the question of energy independence and threats to national security, like economic security, border security, resource security, and so forth.

The investigation of this issue is particularly important, as policy makers in the least developed countries are increasingly concerned about growing reliance on energy imports, particularly fossil fuels, and increasing CO2 emissions. Mounting energy consumption has not only made their economies vulnerable to environmental disasters and increased health costs, but also to external shocks due to frequent fluctuations in international market prices for petroleum products. Since available studies are largely based on cross-sectional data—which lump together countries with different characteristics— empirical evidence is contradictory. In-depth case studies of countries with different backgrounds would certainly provide better insights into the link between aid, growth, remittances and CO2 emissions, and contribute to ongoing policy dialogue. Our empirical results, based on an in-depth case study of Nepal, suggest that more foreign aid and remittances reduce CO2 emissions, whereas financial development and higher income increase CO2 emissions. These findings point to the importance of market mechanisms for regulating financial development and higher income to control CO2 emissions, without undermining competitiveness.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.5547/01956574.40.1.ksha,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

This is because, delay in construction completion will bring huge contractual penalties and extra cost to the contractor and is, therefore, a management headache to the project team. Hydropower projects consisting long underground waterways system passing through varying geological ground conditions may hinder achieving targeted milestones due to uncertainty associated to the geological risks.

The aim of this manuscript is to describes existing brittle failure (rock burst) prediction methods that are being practiced worldwide and propose necessary editions so that quality of assessment is enhanced. The methods described are very practical and the author is confident that professional engineers will use them to evaluate and predict potential rock burst/ rock spalling scenario in the tunnels during planning, design and construction phases.

Most of the hydropower projects have long waterway systems consisting unlined high pressure shafts, underground powerhouse cavern, headrace and tailrace tunnels. The maximum static head reached with unlined pressure shaft and pressure tunnel concept is 1047 meter, which is equivalent to almost 10.5 MPa. It is obvious that the rock mass in the periphery of unlined shafts and tunnels experience high hydrostatic pressure exerted by the flowing water discharge. Experienced gained from the construction and operation of these unlined pressure shafts and tunnels were useful to develop design criterion and principles applied here in the Scandinavia. This paper reviews some of the first attempts of the use of unlined pressure shaft and tunnel concepts, highlights major failure cases, reviews and evaluates the triggering factors for the failure and also discusses about the gradual development of design criterion for the unlined pressure shafts and tunnels.

Canal lining determines the cost of project to a great extent but also the discharge delivery efficiency of the irrigation system. Though earthen canal sections are least expensive, simple to maintain and environmentally friendly, they have high seepage rates and demand frequent repair. In the light of need for resource conservation and the general unavailability of labour for maintenance work, a canal lining, though more expensive, may be justifiable in the long run. Technological advances in the construction have made available lighter and more affordable materials that enhance many parts of the irrigation process.It is the private sector that should lead the development of these technologies as they relate to the construction business. We can look to foreign markets to see how canal lining technologies have improved the use of this tool in various environments and soils. In the Nepali context, we use traditional lining techniques like stone or reinforced concrete, which are effective in the plains, but less so in the hills and remote.

These changes have tremendous effects on agriculture systems especially in the areas where rainfall is the precondition of agriculture. This paper will investigate monsoon patterns in Nepal and how they correlate with recorded rice yields. The results were analyzed and cross-checked with AquaCrop, a crop water productivity model. The findings indicate that the Nepal’s monsoon patterns do not follow a definitive trend. Parameters such as onset and withdrawal dates, duration and distribution are quite unpredictable. The patterns, however, do have direct impact on national average rice yields, but that effect has turned less sensitive in recent years. The findings suggest that though monsoon has vital role on rice production in Nepal, where agriculture systems depend primarily on rainfall, more research is required to predict more accurately and precisely the production functions and relationships to yield. The better we understand this relationship, the more we can compensate for adverse monsoon patterns through anticipatory deployment of ag-technologies and advanced management options. Furthermore, support from legislators will be required to move these ideas into practice.

Sulitar Irrigation System, located in Chitwan district of Nepal and constructed almost two decades ago, is one of them. The farmers have been relentlessly working for construction, maintenance, repair and operation of the system with wider community participation. Participation is not only limited to the field level but also extends to crafting of rules and regulation pertaining to the governance of the system. Participatory approach adopted in this system has fostered transparency and accountability in the management entity with a sense of ownership and self responsibility as an asset embraced by water users. In addition, effective system of resource mobilization for Operation and Maintenance (O & M) is appreciable. Their working culture of participation, purposefulness and integrity has drawn in huge amount of internal as well as external resources to the project. Efficient networking with other organizations has led to profound resource mobilization, leadership sharing and a buildup of strong social capital. They are also well aware of the sustainability of the system and pre-requisites for it.

Available data were collected from the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MoAD), Department of Agriculture (DoA) and Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC). Green house gas emission (GHG) was estimated by using IPCC 2006 guidelines. Agricultural activities contribute directly to emissions of greenhouse gases through a variety of processes including the source categories such as enteric fermentation in domestic livestock, livestock manure management, rice cultivation, and agricultural soil management. Diverse traditional agriculture systems, unique diversities in land types and unavailability of required disaggregated data at the national level as defined by the emission factor data base (EFDB) of the IPCC 2006, were the problem encountered while calculating the emission status in this study. Annual methane (CH4) emission from paddy fields ranged from 111.57 to 133.07 Gg over years 2000 to 2010 but it was found lowest ( 111.57 Gg) in the year 2002 and highest (133.07 Gg) in the year2003. In the year 2010, methane emission from paddy cultivation represented about 17.48 % of cumulative methane emission both from livestock sector and paddy fields throughout Nepal. Also, some relevant policies and potential strategies towards mitigation measures of methane gas emission from paddy fields for the future in Nepal are highlighted.Agronomy Journal of Nepal (Agron JN), Vol.4, Page: 142-148, 2016",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/AJN/article/download/15537/12529,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

We draw on material from a household survey, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews, collected in 2017 in Dhading and Tanahun districts in rural Nepal. The results show that each of the three artefacts initiate distinct, gendered dynamics in terms of uptake, uses and effects. Women's use of electric rice cookers aligns with their gendered identity as cooks, helping them improve their gendered work and do not trigger resistance from men. In contrast, the use of mobile phones, social media and television, prompt complex gender outcomes, resistances, and negotiations. Young people use social media to initiate self-negotiated marriages, shunning arranged marriages thus increasing their agency. It was reported that these self-negotiated marriages tent to be earlier (ages 12-14) than before, as young girls drop out of school to marry their chosen partners, thus threatening their empowerment. Access to television and internet has increased awareness about family planning methods, but persistent gender hierarchies hinder women from freely deciding on and accessing these methods. Women and youth pursuing new opportunities that challenge gender norms are sometimes labelled as unfaithful and unruly by others in the villages.

Denolle et al (2015) and Yin et al. (2018) suggest to use the source spectrogram in order to analyze the radiation during the rupture itself. Here, we take a retrospective view on these studies to better establish the methodology of source spectrogram, and highlight its strengths and limitations. We provide clear interpretation of the temporal evolution of the source spectrogram through time-variant high-frequency falloff rate and radiated energy rate using canonical kinematic and pseudo-dynamic examples. The radiated energy rate provides the amount of energy radiated through time and its integral is the total radiated energy. It is most sensitive to fault heterogeneities in the local slip-rate function and its peak, and in rupture velocity. The high-frequency falloff rate peaks at times of zero moment acceleration, but remains constant otherwise and theoretically equal to one. The M7.8 2015 Nepal earthquake exemplified the propagation of a slip pulse and is thus perfectly suited to demonstrate this approach. We use 3D empirical Greens functions to remove wave propagation effects and construct the P-wave source function. We then construct spectrograms and explore the variations in the radiated energy rate functions. We find that, as expected from unilateral dislocation models, the Nepal earthquake radiated seismic waves at the beginning and at the end of the rupture, but not during the phase of high moment release. Finally, we interpret our results in light of rupture dynamics, i.e. the earthquake initiation, propagation, and arrest.",,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Niche specific commodities that have comparative advantage could be produced in fair quantity to meet the demand of huge market of neighboring India and China as purchasing capacity of people in those countries has improved markedly mainly for quality agriculture commodities. Trade deficit, food insecurity, income generation, poverty reduction, and employment generation could be addressed by turning present status of subsistence agriculture into robust, vibrant and commercial agriculture through technology led agro-industrialization. There are agro-commodities which are imported from India and other countries in huge quantity by the scarce hard currency earned through remittance. Evidence shows that almost 70% of the remittance is spent for agriculture commodities which have high potentiality to produce within the country even after local consumption. Such produce could be exported to other countries to mitigate trade imbalance, enhance export promotion and import reduction and promote graduating Nepal from LDC to DC within the stipulated time frame as proposed a couple of years ago by the government of Nepal.

It also contributes to improving gender parity and social inclusion, especially in situations where women are challenged by harsh living conditions. This chapter examines how gender issues that were considered are addressed in the policies related to electricity in India, Kenya, and Nepal. The analysis reveals that whilst more than half of the reviewed documents were devoid of any explicit mention of gender concerns, an increasing number of electricity policies are now reflecting gender considerations. The predominantly “gender-blind” approach towards the potential benefits of electricity access emanates from a reluctance to explicitly acknowledge gender based differences in needs in creating equitable outcomes. The assumption that electricity access itself is enough for associated benefits to trickle down, that too equitably for men and women, stems from limited awareness. This is aggravated further by the absence of documented evidence on the merit of including gender elements in electrification policies and programmes. Based on the review of existing electricity policies, this chapter provides specific recommendations for incorporating gender in the electricity policies with a view to support and address the broader energy justice concerns.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-24021-9_6,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) are the primary vegetable products, whereas cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) and other green leafy vegetables are mostly cultivated as secondary vegetable products. Dug wells are the major sources of irrigation on vegetable farmland. Out of the total sampled farm households, about 42% of farmers are associated with farmers group and 37% have basic training on vegetable farming. Majority of farmers have savings from vegetable production and marketing. Despite few constraints like price fluctuation (81%) and high middleman margins (71%), vegetable farming in Kirtipur has many opportunities particularly being a major source income and livelihood (93%), self-employment generation (87%) and growing market demand (83%). The opportunities in commercial vegetable farming have continuously attracted the farmers in Kirtipur; however, the existing constraints has deprived farmers from their expected returns. Therefore, this paper recommends to portray possible options to promote opportunities and overcome the existing constraints to retain commercial vegetable farming as a sustainable source for farm households in Kirtipur.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23418/19847,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

This study aims to explore exergetic efficiency and environmental cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology in different cities of Nepal. The solar exergy efficiency of 12 cities of Nepal is evaluated herein with various parameters. It is observed that the city of Janakpur carries the highest amount of solar PV exergy efficiency of 25.77% and 36.27%, considering solar cell efficiency of 12% and 22.5%, respectively. Similarly, Bharatpur has the lowest solar PV exergy efficiency of 23.96% and 34.46%, with solar cell efficiency of 12% and 22.5%, respectively. In addition, average thermal exergy efficiency of solar PV varies between 7.69% and 17.70%, whereas total exergy efficiency varies between 19.71–29.58% and 30.19–40.2%. It is also found that the months of March and April carry the maximum average solar exergy efficiency, whereas July and August bring the least. In addition, an enviroeconomic study on various cities demonstrates that the cities of Mahendranagar and Dhangadhi produce solar power with higher environmental cost.

This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing an estimate for quarterly GDP for the period of 1997/98 Q1 to 2017/18 Q4 following well established Chow-Lin procedure. The quarterly exports and government tax revenue are used to extrapolate the magnitude and movement of quarterly GDP. The results show a deterministic seasonal movement over the quarters. In particular, increased economic activities are observed in the second and fourth quarters while making a comparison on quarter to quarter basis.

Providing electricity access in remote areas is one of the foremost challenges of any developing country. The purpose of this study is to develop and propose a reliable and low-cost model for electrification. The study presents an optimized choice between decentralized renewable-energy systems and grid expansion. Opting for an analytical method for the modelling and analysis of electrification options based on life-cycle cost (LCC) and economic distance limit, each energy system for varied load conditions is compared for a better option. A framework for energy-system selection based on available resources is proposed. It compares the grid-expansion option with potential isolated renewable-energy systems to ensure energy access to the area under consideration. Additionally, off-grid configurations that rely on renewable energy sources are also considered for the necessity of backup supply to ensure continuous power to the research area. Techno-economic assessment is carried out for different off-grid and hybrid configurations proposed in this study and their feasibility checks are carefully examined. Commercial efficacy of the proposed hybrid energy systems is assessed by comparing the life cycle and energy cost and by performing different additional sensitivity analyses. The study concludes that reduced generation cost supports the increasing penetration of electrification. The LCC for grid expansion is the most economical under high-load conditions, whereas for the isolated and sparsely settled populations with low-load conditions, photovoltaic power backed up with a diesel generator is the most economical.",http://academic.oup.com/ce/article-pdf/5/4/690/40824944/zkab042.pdf,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

The disaster destroyed many houses and public infrastructures and severely affected 14 districts in the central region of Nepal. Most of the affected people were disconnected from basic services such as safe drinking water. Being a basic human need, essential to live a healthy life, drinking water scheme rehabilitation project was initiated by many non-governmental agencies in coordination with the Government of Nepal (GoN). However, due to the limitation of the funds and time, most of the implementing agencies faced problems to prioritize schemes and the communities, which at first needed to focus to reinstate. Therefore, a vulnerable ranking method was adopted to distinguish the priorities to reconstruct damaged and totally destroyed water schemes in Dhading, Gorkha, Nuwakot, and Rasuwa districts of Nepal, which are the districts in the most earthquake affected region. In the process of vulnerability ranking, three major community level parameters and indicators were considered for the ranking. 1) Number of households without safe drinking water after an earthquake, 2) Number of households without improved sanitation after an earthquake, and 3) Disadvantage Group (DAG) ranking of the Village Development Committees (VDCs) of the districts. This process of ranking using community level parameters technique is able to substantiate a justice scientifically in front of the communities, government, donor, and other stakeholders in the selection of VDCs to rehabilitate the drinking water schemes.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/23577/19953,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

However, mainstreaming climate change issues into sectoral policies from the government can be seen as recent activities in Nepal. Nepal has contributed negligible amount of emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) of global greenhouse gas, it is the fourth most vulnerable country in the world. In this context, this paper aims to review climate change adaptation policies in terms of sectoral integration. This paper has adopted text-mining method for information retrieval and knowledge mining and followed step-by-step approach to undertake review of policies. It concludes that National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) in 2010 can be a milestone in sectoral adaptation of climate change issue largely because it has provided the national framework for sectoral adaptation to climate change. However, NAPA ignores the importance of structural and institutional reforms needed for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into sectoral agencies. Climate change Policy, 2011, Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) 2011, Constitution of Nepal, 2015, Local Government Operation Act (LGOA) 2017, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017 and National REDD+ Strategy, 2018 are other prominent legislative and policy frameworks that have significant contribution in sectoral integration of climate change adaptation issues. However, lack of climate change act in order to implement fully these policies into practice for its implementation can be a major obstacle to achieve the goal. In this context, strong legislative foundation with effective institutional mechanism among different sectors will be very crucial to capture the spirit of new Federal Constitution of Nepal.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/23412/19841,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Institutional and Legislative Systems (ILS) approach has been adopted focusing on three aspects: i) legal and regulatory frameworks, ii) policies and programs, and iii) organizational/institutional set-up. This paper concludes that newly endorsed Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act (2017) can be a milestone in disaster management of Nepal not only because it has replaced about 40 years old Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 but also for the first time, it saw disaster risk management as an process focusing on different stages of disaster management cycles, preparedness, response and rehabilitation and mitigation. The provision of well-structured functional institutional set-up from the centre to local level can have positive outcome in disaster management. However, it overlooks significant aspect, such as the declaration of disaster-prone zones limiting the right of provincial disaster management committee only for recommendation to the Government of Nepal. Most of policies, strategies and legislations focused on some specific disasters such as flood, landslide, earthquake and GLOF/avalanches at national level paying less emphasis to the local level. Even now, most of the policy interventions towards different cycles of disaster risk management have laid emphasis on preparedness and response rather than to rehabilitation and mitigation. The conflicting provisions in Acts such as Water Resource Act (1992) and Building Act (1998) with Local Government Operation Act (2017) have made overlapping of their roles and responsibilities. So, the policy formulation and institutional set-up needs to be complemented by the ability and competence to operationalize the intent of the relevant acts and policies at all levels of government.The Geographical Journal of NepalVol. 11: 1-24, 2018 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/gjn/article/download/19546/16004,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

The deformation in the tunnel takes place to such an extent that it is irreversible and of significant magnitude, which is often known as tunnel squeezing. In order to limit such plastic deformation in tunnels, it is desirable that the response of the rock mass to induced stresses is known so that requirement of rock support can be estimated. Contrary to the assumption of uniform in-situ stresses made in analytical solutions for elasto-plastic analyses, large degree of stress anisotropy condition prevails in most tunnelling conditions. The effect of such anisotropic stress condition leads to varying degrees of deformations around the tunnel contour. Therefore, stress anisotropy is also an important factor that needs to be addressed to ensure a proper support design for tunnels. This paper discusses the inter-relationship among rock mass property, in-situ stresses including horizontal to vertical stress ratio, tunnel support pressure and deformation. The study is based on the tunnel cases from the Nepal Himalaya. Three completed tunnel projects were selected, where moderate to large tunnel deformations had been recorded. Long term deformation records were analyzed to assess time independent and time dependent deformations. Results of the analyses of the tunnels in weak and schistose rock mass at stress anisotropy states show that a good correlation among tunnel strain, rock mass shear modulus, support pressure, vertical stress and stress ratio of horizontal to vertical stresses exists. Moreover, the study also shows that significant amount of time dependent deformation can occur in such weak rock mass. Such deformation was found to be high in schist and micaceous phyllite, moderate in graphitic phyllite and low in siliceous phyllite. The suggested relationships can be used as a basis for an early estimate of instantaneous and final deformations and the corresponding requirement of support pressures in tunnel walls in weak and schistose rock mass.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/hn.v16i0.12212HYDRO Nepal  Journal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue. 16, 2015 January Page: 7-13 Upload date: March 1, 2015 ",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/12212/9902,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

The control strategies for Electronic Load Controller (ELC), three - phase ac/dc converter and buck converter are realized in Matlab Simulink environment. The simulated system was able to store surplus power into battery bank when load demand was less than power generated by Synchronous Generator (SG) and supply when the load demand was higher than generator’s generation.

The impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly evident in the country, exacerbating vulnerabilities in sectors such as energy, and public health. Climate change has caused rising temperatures, glacial retreat, altered rainfall patterns, and frequent extreme weather events, which not only threaten the environment but also pose serious risks to public health (2). Climate-sensitive health outcomes in Nepal include a range of diseases such as vector-borne, respiratory, and food and waterborne illnesses, along with undernutrition and mental health concerns (3). Nepal's energy sector relies heavily on hydropower, which makes up nearly 90% of the country&#8217;s electricity generation. However, climate-induced changes in water availability due to altered rainfall patterns and glacial melt pose a significant risk to hydropower production. In addition, rural households remain heavily dependent on traditional biomass fuels for cooking, contributing to indoor air pollution and respiratory diseases (4).Building on existing evidence, this study aims to investigate the interconnected impacts of climate variability and energy insecurity on public health in Nepal. The primary objective is to synthesize evidence from health, climate, and energy sectors to assess how these factors jointly influence health outcomes, with a particular emphasis on identifying population vulnerabilities. Additionally, the research seeks to formulate evidence-based policy recommendations to improve energy security, enhance public health, and strengthen climate resilience. These recommendations will target the challenges of climate change and energy insecurity, promoting sustainable development and health equity in vulnerable communities.This study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining an extensive literature review with expert consultations. The literature review draws on peer-reviewed articles, policy reports, and institutional publications to analyze the current and projected effects of climate change and energy insecurity on public health. The review emphasizes risk factors, vulnerabilities, and future scenarios. Expert consultations will be conducted to contextualize findings, validate key insights, and refine policy recommendations. This combined methodology aims to generate a holistic understanding of the synergistic impacts of climate and energy factors on health and inform actionable, resilience-focused strategies.Preliminary findings highlight a strong link between energy insecurity and health outcomes, exacerbated by climate change. The study proposes a conceptual framework linking these factors and offer policy recommendations to address energy poverty, enhance resilience, and improve health outcomes in Nepal.References: Tome J, Richmond HL, Rahman M, Karmacharya D, Schwind JS.

So, this study analyzes the suitability of distributed wind energy production in Tila village of Jumla district in the western part of Nepal. Five-year (2015-2019) wind speed data were examined to obtain wind power density and energy density. Two-parameter Weibull probability density function was used to evaluate these two quantities. The annual Weibull parameters k and c of 1.73 and 4.21 m/s were obtained to calculate 43.79 W/m2 power density and 378.37 kWh/m2 energy density. This study also provides the economic evaluation of a 100 kW distributed wind energy system, and the technical and economic aspects of the proposed system are compared with the corresponding characteristics of the existing renewable energy systems, i.e., micro hydropower and solar power. The study shows that when there is not enough sunlight for the solar PV system and not enough water flow coupled with maintenance problems in the micro hydropower system, the distributed wind energy system may function as a substitute system.</p>",,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

When Nepal was in its childhood as a young democratic nation in the 1950s, India, with its vast ‘experience’ under the British colonial rule (colonial mindset), extracted lop-sided agreements on the Koshi, Gandaki and Mahakali rivers.Whereas India irrigates 12,200,000 acres of land, flood mitigates flood hazards and benefits from other intangible benefits. Nepal gets a meager 160,000 acres irrigation facility (1.3 percent of total irrigation benefits) from these unequivocal biased agreements. The adverse social and ecological impacts in Nepal are unaccounted for.Such water resource agreements have resulted in the sad present-day plight of Nepal: social life and industries are in total disarray with dismally low economic growth rates (GDP) forcing millions of Nepalese to seek employment abroad.Before it gets out of hand, India’s direct/indirect domination over Nepal’s water resources and politics should end, so that Nepal can develop its economy and hydropower in peace.Nepal should first develop run-of-river projects as per the modality of 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project (cost 1000 US$/kWh) and medium size storage hydropower projects (140 MW Tanahu). Muddling with large storage projects like 1200 MW Budhi Gandaki HEP will only further delay the execution of RoR projects.

The main objective of the study was to investigate the impact of climate change in the water basin and its catchment areas. The method was a survey of relevant literatures. Climate change is a big issue not only in developed countries but also in developing countries. The study found that the temperature is rising with 2.00 C on average per annum in western Nepal. This is relatively 3 times higher than lower temperature increase within the country and significantly higher in comparison to global trend of temperature variation. Over the last 36 years (1975-2010) in western Nepal, temperature is rising on an average of 1.2°C per annum. This is twice as compared to the global increment. This indicates more vulnerability of climate change in hills and high hills of Nepal. The average rise of temperature in Nepal is 0.06oC per year.

However, the energy law and policy emerge as a concern all over the world and states are taking initiative to ensure a balance among these three dilemmas. It is the reality that Bangladesh suffers severe shortage in power generation which also affects its overall economic development. Hence, in one hand, it needs to ensure continuous energy supply which is closely connected with country’s energy security also. On the other hand, it also needs to make a balance between the challenges of producing energy in affordable cost which will not adversely affect the environment as well. Nevertheless, Bangladesh, being a lower-middle income country at least put focus on the energy law and policy triangle in recent years. Still ensuring balance among these three opposite directions is still a challenge for Bangladesh. Despite that, the recent laws and policies relating to energy in Bangladesh show its commitment towards climate change mitigation which encourages more production and use of renewable energies in the country. Although there are some deficiencies in those laws and policies which can be overcome by further initiative. The State can reaffirm its position towards environmentally friendly affordable energy by amending those policies and legislations. This research paper is aimed to assess the dilemma of the Energy Law and Policy Triangle in recently legislated energy related laws and policies in Bangladesh.HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue No: 22Page: 10-15Uploaded date: January 14, 2018",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/18991/15512,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

More than 85 percent of its total energy comes from traditional biomass energy such as forests, agricultural residues and by-products from crops. Due to increasing per capita energy consumption, natural resources are being depleted with heavy emissions of GHGs in the atmosphere, which causes global warming. The main objective of the study was to investigate current energy consumption practices, to estimate particulate matter and carbon emissions from current practices and to recommend the most suitable alternative energy technologies. The fieldwork was based on primary and secondary data with a design methodology. Firewood burning was found to be the major source of energy used for cooking purposes in Samagaun. The use of this traditional fuel has negative environmental implications, such as deforestation, indoor air pollution and it ultimately affects human health. The results show that traditional cooking stoves (TCS) are used more than improved cooking stoves (ICS). The total amount of firewood used per day by TCS is 2135 kg/day, and by ICS it is 349 kg/day. The average amount of firewood consumed by traditional and improved cooking stoves per day is 62.79 kg and 43.63 kg, respectively. The annual per capita firewood consumption of TCS and ICS is 4401.9 kg and 3266.7 kg, respectively. The calculation shows that per capita firewood consumption by TCS users is 1.3 times higher than that of ICS users. The annual per capita carbon emissions from TCS and ICS is 8055.47 kg CO2e and 5978.15 kg CO2e, respectively. This calculation shows that ICS emits 1.3 times less CO2 into the atmosphere than the TCS. The average mean particulate concentration at normal atmospheric conditions for a traditional cooking stove was found to be 2866 μg/Nm3 and for an improved cooking stove 1333 μg/Nm3, both of which far exceed the national standard of 230 μg/m3 TSP. Based on the study results, metallic improved cooking stoves could be recommended as the best alternative energy technology in the study area.",https://journals.ub.uni-koeln.de/index.php/JNRD/article/view/737/760,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Several hydropower plants are also currently under construction. There is no doubt that the surplus electricity will be significantly high in the coming years. Given the previous trend in electricity consumption, it will be a challenge to maximize the use of surplus electricity. In this work, the potential solutions to maximize the use of this surplus electricity have been analysed. Three approached are proposed: (i) increasing domestic electricity consumption by shifting the other energy use sectors to electricity, (ii) cross-border export of electricity, and (iii) conversion of electricity to hydrogen via electrolysis. The current state of energy demand and supply patterns in the country are presented. Future monthly demand forecasts and surplus electricity projections have been made. The hydrogen that can be produced with the surplus electricity via electrolysis is determined and an economic assessment is carried out for the produced hydrogen. The analysis of levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) under different scenarios resulted values ranging from 3.8 €/kg to 4.5 €/kg.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0960148123006857,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

While substantial hydro investments are in the pipeline; a strong, diverse hydro-mechanical manufacturing industry is established. But the electro-mechanical industry is non-existent. Policies have attracted substantial private investment in hydropower sector, but it is not geared towards the use of electricity for overall economic development of Nepal and has yet to streamline policy with respect to lean season augmented flow of water for drinking and irrigation purposes within and outside Nepal. A more fundamental paradox is that Nepal government has yet to acknowledge these anomalies that hinder sustainable economic developments.HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water, Energy and Environment Issue: 23Year: 2018",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/20821/17098,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

However, despite having tremendous water resources, only 2% of Nepal’s hydroelectricity potential has been tapped. Of the challenges that Nepali hydro faces, sediment erosion is a major one. Sediment erosion refers to an erosive tendency of sediment particles flowing with water over the exposed turbine parts including the runner. This paper deals with a sample analysis of sediment particles from the Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project. In this paper, we test for particle size distribution, particle count, mineral composition, and erosion potential analysis. For the mineral and erosion potential analysis, the sand samples range from 75 ìm to 200 ìm because the Tamakoshi plant consists of sediment traping system for particles larger than 150 ìm. The sediment samples were collected from three different points in the headrace and the severity of the effect of erosion has been analyzed in terms of depending variables like particle size, concentration, and mineral composition.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/hn.v16i0.12216     HYDRO Nepal  Journal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue. 16, 2015, January Page: 28-31 Upload date: March 1, 2015",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/12216/9906,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

The adoption of rain water harvesting was mostly driven by trainings that farmers received while controlling for age, poverty status and off-farm income. The adoption of RWH technology more than doubles household agricultural and livestock income. Instrumental variable approach was used to check the robustness of the findings. Adopters benefited from an increased supply of irrigation water, which allows them to diversify their crops from cereal production to high-value crops during dry season. Given the many weather-related uncertainties faced by rainfed farmers in Nepal, rain water harvesting is potentially a very useful climate adaptation strategy.

Green Revolution technologies and the package of practices largely ignored the role of ecosystem services, leaving a large population of small farmers’ food- and nutrition-insecure. Biodiversity, especially, agrobiodiversity is in decline and this vital cross-cutting element is less discussed and interlinked in nexus literature. The interlinking food system with water–energy–biodiversity nexus, therefore, is essential to achieve a resilient food system. It ensures the vital structures and functions of the ecosystem on which it is dependent are well protected in the face of increasing socio-economic and climatic stress. This paper reviews the food system of Nepal through the lens of the food–water–energy–biodiversity (FWEB) nexus to develop a more robust food system framework. From this approach, food system foresight can benefit from different nature-based solutions such as agro-ecosystem-based adaptation and mitigation and climate-resilient agro-ecological production system. We found that the FWEB nexus-based approach is more relevant in the context of Nepal where food and nutrition insecurity prevails among almost half of the population. Improvement in the food system requires the building of synergy and complementary among the components of FWEB nexus. Hence, we proposed a modified framework of food system foresight for developing resilience in a food system, which can be achieved with an integrated and resilient nexus that gives more emphasis to agro-ecological system-based solutions to make the food system more climate resilient. This framework can be useful in addressing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, and 15 and can also be used as a tool for food system planning based on a broader nexus.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/10/8/1129/pdf,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

It is a bottom-up decentralized approach for the management of water resources. IWRM is a challenge to conventional practices, attitudes and professional certainties. It confronts entrenched sectoral interest & requires that the water resources are managed holistically for the benefits of all.The broad objective of the multidisciplinary study was to assess the possibilities of Human Dimensions of water resource development and its management. Water resource accounting is done by the collection of water resources data through participatory group formation.  Scientific data of hydro and metrological stations was also acquired. Hydrological modeling tools were also used. Feasibility of hydropower plant and potential of power production in the basin was readily estimated.Total daily discharge of the Durlung Watershed was estimated on an average of 157 Million Liters. Rivers of the watershed are turbulent, unsteady & flowing with very high current, which can be utilized by local people for low cost drinking water, tourism, irrigation & hydropower generation. Micro-hydropower production possibilities in Ratan and Deuta rivers have shown multidimensional positive impacts on socio-economic development of the region. Level of community partnership in IWRM and synchronization with the local, district & national level institutional framework for Basin Management was observed to be satisfactory. Participatory research was carried to identify water resource base with school & community partnership. Community motives, their difficulties and gaps in community level organization were identified.

This paper analyses the energy system development, the associated CO2 and local pollutant emissions in Nepal and Thailand using the bottom-up cost-minimizing MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) modeling framework under the base case and three different carbon tax scenarios during 2010-2050. Nepal's energy system is dominated by biomass and is estimated to remain the same by 2050, however its share is likely to decrease from 84% to 35% during 2010-2050. A wide increase in the share of petroleum products and hydropower is expected in the energy system of Nepal by 2050. The power generation mix of Nepal would continue to remain hydropower dominant during the planning period, however there would be a small increase in the share of other renewables (i.e. solar and municipal solid waste) by 2050. For Thailand, this study found that the energy system would be driven by coal with the reduction in the combined share of oil and natural gas by 2050. Unlike Nepal, the power sector of Thailand is natural gas dominant, and would continue to remain the same throughout the planning period. Nuclear power generation is estimated to penetrate after 2035 and its share is estimated to increase from 3% in 2035 to 9% in 2050 under the base case. The transport sector is the major contributor in the total CO2 emissions in Nepal while the power sector occupied the largest share in the total CO2 emissions in Thailand in 2010. The transport sector in Nepal would continue to remain the major CO2 emitting sector while the industrial sector in Thailand would be the major CO2 contributor by 2050.

Brushing aside these social and environmental costs lightly, the government has launched the holy ‘jihad/crusade’ to develop hydroelectricity. Nepal’s policy framers of 10,000 MW in 10 years crusade have totally failed to see the larger picture in the Ganges basin. This failure to see the larger Ganges picture is, to a large extent, attributed to Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal’s 2009 decision to unbundle Water Resources Ministry into Energy and Irrigation. Electricity attained the upper class status with Water downgraded to Dalit class!India’s greatest burning problem in the Ganges basin, that supports nearly fifty per cent of her 1,200 million people, is WATER. India, therefore, is in desperate need of storages in Nepal to realize her master plan, the Interlinking of Rivers. With Nepal in desperate pursuit of hydroelectricity, India sees this as an opportune moment to avail GRATIS stored WATER through Nepal’s default. According to Bhim Subba, a Bhutanese of Nepalese origin, this is the fundamental flaw in all past Indo-Nepal deals. Subba believes India must concede that success of her Ganges water strategy hinges entirely on Nepal. He argues that water stored in Nepal has monetary value and this must be factored in all storage projects. Such a policy would be mutually beneficial for both the countries.

In efficient lighting scenario, energy consumption will be 2 tera joule in 2040. In efficient heating ventilation and air conditioning scenario, efficient cooking scenario and steam generation scenario, energy consumption will be 12 tera joule, 6.5 tera joule and 4.2 tera joule in 2040. In the combined policy scenario, energy consumption will be 37.76 tera joule in 2040. Which result saving of 28.14 tera joule as compared to BAU scenario.

The country’s population density is increasing along with rapid growth of population especially over mountainous cities, southern hills and the Terai. On the other hand, a number of fatal natural calamities, such as flash flooding and landslides raised by clutter intensive rainfall, have been increasing since the last decade. To deal with such water hydro meteorological disasters, accurate information on spatial and temporal variation of rainfall distribution is very important. In Nepal, the amount of rainfall has been obtained from limited rain gauge networks, which may leads to many errors in making a Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE). Weather radar observations have recently been highlighted as an alternative option for estimating the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation across specified time intervals. However, estimating rainfall from radar observation has its own challenges, especially over a mountainous country like Nepal.Another mountainous country Japan is well known for using weather radar observation to make QPE product. Different types of weather radar have been used to record, monitor and forecast precipitation in Japan for both operational and research purposes. A high level research work has also been done on this field. The high spatial and temporal (250-m and 1-min) QPE product obtained from the radar observation is available for the public. It shows good harmony with ground data in the flat and mountain areas of Japan. Though Nepal and Japan are located in different regions, both countries represent complex mountain regions and have been facing natural disaster caused by extreme rainfall. In Nepal, weather radar observation for estimating precipitation amounts has not started on an operational basis till date. Hence, sharing knowledge and skills from Japan’s research on weather radar observation would play a key role to achieve the radar based QPE product in Nepal. Therefore, we discuss about the challenge in obtaining QPE product, considering an example of the progress of weather radar system in Japan. It is believed that any discussion on it will be a reference for weather radar deployment and its QPE product in Nepal in coming days.  HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water Energy and EnvironmentIssue: 21, July, 2017Page: 50-59Upload Date: July 18, 2017",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/17822/14468,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

The Narayani River Basin's exposures and vulnerabilities are at danger from a flood catastrophe of this kind, hence this studies attempts to reduce and control the risk of flooding in order to better manage disasters. The factors of flood hazard, flood exposures, and flood vulnerability are investigated as part of the ward-level flood risk assessment, which aims to prevent and manage the flood disaster. The hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) for the 2018 flood event was used in this study to create the GIS- based modeling of the flood inundation maps. Additionally, it calculated the various return periods for floods in the river basin—5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 years. Furthermore, the flood extent was confirmed using the flood map produced by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) using remotely sensed techniques. For Hydraulic modelling, ALOS/PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (12.5m.) spatial resolution was used. In addition, RAS-MAPPER generated the geometric data for the hydraulic modeling, which was then transferred into HEC-RAS. This data included the cross-section, flow route, streamline, and bank lines. On both sides of the river, the necessary Manning value ""n"" values were computed for every cross-section. The steady-flow models of the anticipated flood hydrographs were created using the hydraulic model. Google Earth Engine (GEE) flood maps generated from Sentinel-1C radar satellite data were used to validate the results for the 2018 flood events. When comparing the simulated result's flood inundation area with the remote sensing data's flood area, the overlap area for the 2018 flood event is 65%. Additionally, the flood area is verified. In addition, the hydraulic model generated flow conditions for 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 year return periods. The river basin's surface water level and flood extent are both progressively rising. In order to effectively manage and prepare for potential flood hazards in the study area, an analysis of the flood risk assessment was conducted by taking into consideration three primary factors: the flood hazard map, flood exposure, and flood vulnerability. The layers of the population, crops, schools, hospitals, and road network were all exposed to flooding, and the factors that determined flood vulnerabilities were literacy, urban area, and agecomposition (less than 14 and more than 65). The higher flood risk area was found in Ward number 1, 3, 4,16,18,26 of Bharatpur metropolitan, Gaindakot municipality ward number 1 and 12, 15 of Madhyabindu Municipality.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-31625-8_22,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

A gamut of behavioral anomalies and market failures have been known to inhibit individuals from investing in more fuelefficient vehicles (due to the well-known 'energy efficiency gap'). For example, low levels of knowledge and skills to calculate the lifetime costs of a durable may induce underinvestment in energy-efficiency. This level of knowledge and skills has been encapsulated in the idea of 'energy-related financial literacy' (ERFL). In this study, we use novel data from Kathmandu, Nepal to understand the determinants of ERFL, and to evaluate its effect on the energy efficiency gap in the choice of motorcycles. Our results provide suggestive evidence that individuals with higher levels of ERFL are more likely to own motorcycles that have comparatively low total lifetime costs, i.e., more fuel-efficient motorcycles, especially individuals with stronger computational skills. This study has important implications for the design of relatively low-cost policies such as educational programs that may nudge buyers to invest in energy efficiency.",,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

The unsustainable use of biomass and widespread use of commercial energy are of the major sources of greenhouse gas emission. The alternative to kerosene for lighting is solar home system (SHS), which is one of the potential renewable technologies for rural electrification. The present study has analyzed household energy consumption pattern and greenhouse gases emission from energy consumption practices as well as environmental and economic benefits of SHS in Madi Kalyanpur Village Development Committee of Chitwan district. For the purpose, the primary data were collected through household questionnaire survey, key informant interview (KII) and focus group discussion (FGD). The analysis has shown that 22% of household use all types of energy, i.e. fuel-wood, LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), biogas and SHS as the sources of energy. Thirty-five percent households use fuel-wood, LPG and SHS, 24% use fuel-wood, biogas and SHS, 1% used LPG and SHS, 5% use biogas and SHS, 4% use LPG, biogas and SHS and 9% use fuel-wood and SHS as a source of energy. Almost all people have been using SHS for the lighting purpose. The average annual greenhouse gases emission per household from fuel-wood and liquefied petroleum gas consumption was 7.89 ton and 0.17 ton of CO2 equivalent respectively. Typically, a 40 Wp SHS reduced the consumption of kerosene by 42 liter annually for lighting that displaced 0.11 ton of CO2 equivalent per household per year. The simple payback period for typically 40 Wp SHS was found to be nine years with no subsidy, seven years with subsidy from Alternative Energy Promotion Centre and two years with Indian Government Grant.

Despite this, more than two-thirds of households still rely on traditional biomass, as their primary source of energy, for cooking and heating, making the household fuelwood consumption per person in Nepal among the highest in the world. However, why households’ transitions to clean energy for cooking is slow has been poorly understood. Using energy-specific information from the World Bank’s Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) survey and the Nepal government’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), the cooking and heating energy consumption situation of households across the provinces by rural and urban areas is analyzed briefly. Also, a simple levelized cost of cooking is estimated using different fuel-technology combinations. The main findings of this paper are: limited availability, unreliable supply and high costs are hindering households’ transitions to clean energy from traditional biomass; the combination of fuelwood, liquified petroleum gas and other clean energy sources (multiple fuel stacking) are common within the same household; and, the use of biogas, and to some extent, solar power, for cooking is limited to scale and geographical location. It is expected that electricity will be the most economic and common primary clean cooking energy option for households in the future provided that the government has the policy to address the reliability concerns of electricity and that it is affordable for low-income households.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/nppr/article/download/43420/32898,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Solar photovoltaics and wind now comprise three-quarters of the global net new electricity-generation-capacity additions because they are cheap. The deep renewable electrification of energy services including transport, heating and industry will allow solar and wind to largely eliminate fossil fuels over the next few decades. This paper demonstrates that Nepal will be able to achieve energy self-sufficiency during the twenty-first century. Nepal has good solar and moderate hydroelectric potential but has negligible wind- and fossil-energy resources. The solar potential is about 100 times larger than that required to support a 100% solar-energy system in which all Nepalese citizens enjoy a similar per-person energy consumption to developed countries, without the use of fossil fuels and without the environmental degradation resulting from damming Nepal’s Himalayan rivers. Nepal has vast low-cost off-river pumped hydro-energy-storage potential, thus eliminating the need for on-river hydro storage and moderating the need for large-scale batteries. Solar, with support from hydro and battery storage, is likely to be the primary route for renewable electrification and rapid growth of the Nepalese energy system.",https://academic.oup.com/ce/article-pdf/5/2/243/53682295/zkab011.pdf,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

'Energy imaginaries' can be understood as the set of institutions, logics, values, and visions that spur ideas around what sources of energy and forms of energy governance best foster development. Adopting a historical and comparative perspective and drawing on the notion of 'transnational assemblages', we explore the nature of energy aid interventions and the dynamic shifts of specific actors and discourses in bilateral relations. We focus on Norway, a leading player in energy support, and two of its long-term partner countries, Nepal and Tanzania. Through document analysis and interviews with key actors, we trace how Norwegian energy transnational assemblages have formed part of evolving energy imaginaries in Nepal and Tanzania in radically diverging ways. In Nepal, dominated by an energy imaginary of hydropower as 'white gold', efforts to foster a bottom-up-driven indigent energy sector were eclipsed by an emphasis on facilitating privatisation, resulting in a chaotic fragmentation of the energy landscape. In Tanzania, the donor-state energy imaginaries were centred on grandiose projects of hydropowered industrialisation bound for failure, but later revived as part of an authoritarian project.

Considering the potentiality, we elucidate the result of value chain analysis, arguing that promotion and streamlining of fishing tourism along with the traditional fishers could generate immense livelihood opportunities for resilience along with fish conservation. The value chain analysis showed that livelihood of fishers communities are likely to be enhanced by involving in fishing based tourism support services with fewer fishing activities, which in turn could be supportive to fish conservation.

The rationality of energy transitions toward cleaner energy resources is not only to improve individual living conditions, but also to enhance the economic growth of a nation. Nepal is considered to be one of the countries with a low per-capita electricity use, heavily relying on traditional energy resources such as firewood and agricultural residues. The country is rich in hydropower resources. However, various economic and socioeconomic constraints have left the significant potential for hydroelectricity untapped. This study describes the energy transition patterns in Nepal based on a literature review and field survey of household energy use in the winter. We collected data from 516 households in the Solukhumbu, Panchthar, and Jhapa districts of Nepal. The rate of per-capita electricity consumption was 330 kWh/capita/year, which is significantly lower than that of other contemporary global societies such as India 1000 and China 4900 kWh/capita/year. The increasing trend in hydroelectricity production has optimistically transformed the energy sector toward cleaner resources; this correlates with the GDP per capita. Solar home systems, mini- and micro-hydropower plants, biogas technology, and improved cook stoves have been widely used, which has lowered the health and environmental burdens in rural areas. By analysing the survey data, we found that 25% of the households only relied on traditional cooking fuel, while 67% and 8% of the households relied on mixed and commercial cooking fuels, respectively. Moreover, 77% and 48% of traditional and mixed-fuel-using households were unhappy with current cooking fuels while 40% and 66% of these households preferred to use clean cooking fuels.

Securing energy supply to meet national demand for both the short term and long term is one of the most important priorities for any country all over the world. The concept of energy security is seen to be evolving over the years with recent studies encompassing not only ensuring supply but also focusing on social, economic, environmental, geopolitical, and military concerns related to energy supply and demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) (IEA, 2008) defines energy security as ""the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price"". However, the meaning of energy security is highly context dependent, such as a country's special circumstances, level of economic development, perceptions of risks, researcher's background, time frame of study, etc. Nepal has been facing many challenges in the development of the energy sector. Traditional energy sources like fuel wood, agricultural residue, etc. are the main energy source of Nepal creating the issue of sustainability, indoor air pollution, deforestation, and even human health hazards. There is limited access to modern energy like electricity, especially in rural areas. Despite a huge potential for hydropower, solar power and wind energy, these resources have not been utilized due to geographical, technical, political and economic reasons causing an acute power shortage of electricity and load shedding. The electricity deficit has not only reduced the economic productivity of the country, but also made the country dependent on import of electricity from India. The import of electricity has been increasing rapidly to fulfill the growing demand.Petroleum products are dominant in the transportation sector followed by the industrial, residential and commercial sectors using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking, water boiling, and space heating purposes. In the transport sector, there are no alternatives for petroleum products, except electricity which use in Nepal is insignificant. Nepal is a net importer of petroleum products, and from only one supplier country, India, which makes the country highly vulnerable to oil supply disruptions, oil price fluctuations and their effects. The expenditure made on imported energy exceeds the revenue generated from the export of all commodities. Also, the continued use of the petroleum products in the country highlights the issue of energy security and the equally important issue of sustainability. Nepal was ranked 74th out of 94 countries in 2012 and 111th out of 129 countries in 2016 in terms of Energy Trilemma Index constructed by the World Energy Council that consists of energy security, energy equity and environmental sustainability (WEC, 2018). Increasing energy efficiency, diversification of suppliers geographically, diversification of energy sources, diversification of technologies, stocks of critical fuels, etc. are some of the measures found in the literature that can improve energy security by reducing vulnerabilities. In developing countries like Nepal, energy security can mostly be interpreted as energy access to all people and energy access for expanding industry and service sectors at an affordable cost. There is a need to incorporate energy security in the national energy policy of Nepal with more emphasis on diversification of primary energy sources (other than traditional resources), increase in electricity generation from hydropower resources, reduction of import dependency especially fossil fuel resources, strategic fuel reserves, diversification of energy resources uses in different energy consumption sectors like transport, industries, increase in energy supply from renewable energy sources, etc. This chapter begins with an introduction to energy security concept and quantitative and qualitative analysis of energy security. A review of the energy security situation in the context of Nepal is presented along with different scenarios applying energy security improving measures. Finally, case studies of assessment of the energy security of Nepal under different scenarios are presented.",,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

We combine extensive literature review, expert interviews and own readings from our two decades-long professional career in the RE sector of Nepal to arrive at rational conclusions. Almost all past internationally funded and government-subsidized off-grid solar and wind energy projects failed upon discontinuation of funds. Furthermore, the pristine Himalayan environment was forced to bear the burden of hazardous waste management. Nepal, being one of the best countries for hydropower, should concentrate on this technology. The suitability, convenient availability of other feasible alternatives and social acceptance decides the fate of technologies.

We reviewed 38 articles on ES quantification from across the world to derive 33 indicators encompassing six multidisciplinary dimensions representing the overall energy sector of Nepal. We applied a well-established indicator-based method to develop the Energy Security Composite Index of Nepal (ESCOIN) and examined the evolution of the nation’s energy situation over the last decade. The impact of the indicators on ESCOIN was assessed by principal component analysis (PCA). Results showed that Nepal consistently held a ‘moderate’ status during the analysed period. This can be attributed to excessive reliance on traditional fuels, slow rise in the energy demand due to lack of energy intensive development activities, rate of energy import being almost parallel to the growing demand and some methodological limitations. Furthermore, Nepal ranks very low in the Energy Trilemma Index globally primarily because of its poor ES and equity; its environmental sustainability is comparatively better. We deduce that the possibility of Nepal contributing its hydroelectricity to the energy-hungry neighbours, despite the small generation, is an opportunity but at the stake of large infrastructure development and sincere political commitment and trust. Furthermore, although the values of ESCOIN show a ‘pseudo energy secure’ condition, a lot needs to be attained by Nepal for an energy secure future especially through reduced reliance on traditional and fossil fuels and being self-sufficient, aggressive hydro-electricity development taking the lead.",,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

We aim to achieve two objectives: to create a robust model identifying key socio-economic and climate perception variables affecting household energy behaviour; and to compare the respective impacts of these factors. Applying a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 323 households across 49 districts and three physiographic regions (high hills, mid hills and Terai plains) of Nepal. We fixed the explanatory and response variables through literature review and evaluated three ordinal logistic regression models: one focused solely on socio-economic factors, the second only on climate perception and the third a composite model integrating both. Data statistics showed that 47 % of the respondents preferred no change to their existing energy status, 23 % opted to rely completely on grid-electricity, 14 % favoured switching to renewables, while 16 % preferred an optimal combination of grid-electricity and renewables for their household use. The Composite-model was found to be the best fit model for our dataset. The identified key socio-economic factors include urbanization, education levels, and the availability of energy alternatives indicating a wide disparity in the energy access and use across the different socio-economic categories of Nepal. Likewise, magnitude and timing of summer and winter rainfall, changes in the household energy demands and community level subsidies were found to be the significant climate change perception variables. Hence, our findings highlight the need for better access to modern energy and financial incentives, mostly to the rural remote areas, and community-awareness initiatives throughout the country supported by comprehensive energy policies for sustainable renewable energy transition at the household level as well as in mitigation of the impacts of climate change. By enhancing this policy-science-society interface, our research contributes valuable insights for developing effective strategies to promote renewable energy adoption in similar developing contexts.",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0973082624001315,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

In developing countries, solid waste disposal in open dump sites is widely practised as an easy and economical method of waste disposal. The increased quantity and composition of solid waste has posed a serious threat to public health and environment in developing countries. Hence, alternative waste disposal methods such as composting, recycling etc. can be potential options for sustainable solid waste management. Such methods will also reduce the waste volume prior to reaching the landfill and will increase the landfill’s life. This paper aims to calculate the recovery value from Municipal Solid Waste (i.e. composting, biogas, paper, and plastic) in Jeetpur Simara Sub-Metropolitan City (JSSMC) in Nepal, and to calculate the area required for landfilling and dumping of biodegradable and residual solid waste respectively. Due to high biodegradable content (8,400 kg/day), the recovery values from compost and biogas generation are studied. Optimum distribution of biodegradable solid waste among these two options is also evaluated. A combination of 6.4 tons/day for composting and 2 tons/day for landfilling with a net recovery of NRs. 29,064 per day is calculated. The recovery values from plastic and paper are calculated at NRs. 11,088 and NRs. 15,048 respectively. Hence, a total recovery value of NRs. 201.48 lakhs per year is suggested. This revenue is excluding the construction and operation cost required for the establishment of compost plant and landfill biogas collection system. The area required to landfill 2 tons/day of degradable waste is 0.876 hectares and 4.06 hectares to dump residual solid waste for a design period of 15 years. In case, biogas is not extracted, a total of 4.936 hectares’ land is required for dumping the entire MSW generated from JSSMC. The revenue calculated reduces to NRs. 47,640 per day or NRs. 173.88 lakhs per year.HYDRO Nepal JournalJournal of Water, Energy and Environment Issue: 23Year: 2018",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/download/20831/17108,,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy
