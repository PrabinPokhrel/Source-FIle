The country stands at a critical juncture at the moment. Nepal is looking forward to graduating from being a member of the Least Developed Country (LDC) category. This progress has been hindered first by the decade-long armed conflict between 1996 to 2006 and now as a result of the massive earthquakes in 2015. Nonetheless, Nepal has made a substantial improvement in development indicators, showing encouraging progress towards SDGs, even while these developments are unevenly distributed across various income groups, social groups, and geographical region. With the promulgation of a new Constitution in 2015, Nepal has taken significant steps towards decentralising service delivery and working towards inclusive development. It is still too early to comment on the performance of local bodies under its provisions, but the broad range of power and responsibilities enjoyed by the provincial and local governments provides a promising opportunity to make progress towards achieving the SDGs.",,,SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

As the Constitution and subsequent legislation have devolved significant service delivery responsibilities to the subnational level, especially the local government level, these governments assume a major role in achieving the national Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda. While the formal enabling environment for localizing SDGs is regarded as robust, implementation issues will remain for some time as part of the teething problems of transitioning to the federal and multi-level governance system.",,,SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

The qualitative case study method was adopted as a mode of inquiry. The findings reveal that local governments have yet to fully incorporate the SDG framework directly into their plans, programs, and budgets. They have yet to recognize the benefits of localization in effectively implementing and achieving the SDGs. Local governments face several challenges, including a lack of ownership, limited financial resources, insufficient SDG-friendly data, lack of institutional capacity, and weak coordination and cooperation. Despite these challenges, some local governments have formulated SDG-friendly periodic plans, while others are in the process of doing so. This study sheds light on the shift from an indirect to a direct approach in integrating the SDGs into local plans, programs, and budgets. This paper contribute to on-going efforts to promote sustainable development in Nepal by offering valuable insights to those involved in formulating and implementing local plans.",,,SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

This article discusses waste management (WM) in Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) with a focus on cleaner technology. Waste management has always been an issue in KMC with almost all wastes being dumped directly to a landfill site. The article aims to points out challenge with current waste management based on literature‐ and document reviews. Further, it introduces and analyses technologies to convert waste into energy and evaluates the applicability of the Asian Develop Bank recommendations for waste management in KMC and suggests strategies toward aligning KMC waste management with Nepal's SDG agenda. Findings indicate that Kathmandu has huge potential for implementing waste to energy technologies, and anaerobic digestion seems one of the most promising technologies. Yet, the city lacks a proper waste treatment infrastructure and would benefit from a systematic alignment of technology, policy, and environmental possibilities and challenges in both analysis, planning, and design.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/sd.2183,,SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

While the gendered view of inclusive economic opportunities has received significant attention in recent years, the gap between men and women in developing countries remains significant. Under the assumption that there are fertile prospects to bridge social responsibility and SDGs judiciously, this chapter explores the question: ‘what insights into women’s employment and empowerment can be generated from the state of cooperative enterprises in Nepal?’ The focus is on aspects of women’s employment and empowerment under goal 8, which promotes inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. Learning from the Nepalese experiences, the chapter contends that cooperative enterprise social responsibility (CESR) needs to be approached as the vital link between the internal and the external interests of cooperatives to achieve SDGs.",https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full-xml/10.1108/S2040-724620180000008016,,SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts have questioned Nepal's ability to achieve the 17 United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the post-pandemic era. Yet no scientific studies available to see COVID-19 and SDGs relationships in Nepal, government reports, and macroeconomic updates indicated that COVID-19 is likely to deter significantly in achieving SDGs targets.

This theoretical paper describes the conceptualization and delivery of a virtual collaborative program that was developed through a partnership between the Faculty of Social Work professors at the University of Calgary in Canada and Southwestern State College in Nepal. In this article, we share the model of the program and our motivations for developing the program; a formal evaluation of the model has not yet been conducted. Our pedagogical approach was grounded in anti-oppressive practices, which prioritizes the importance of engaging in empowering practices that share power based on mutual respect and learning. In our attempt to address and mitigate divides of students in the Global South and North, we sought to maximize engagement between students, educators from both institutions and social work practitioners (formal and informal) from Nepal to help promote intercultural learning. We also chose the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals as a site of inquiry with the aim of bridging divides and uncovering commonalities across the two countries – Canada and Nepal. With a mission to deliver an interdisciplinary approach to social work, in this paper, we outline the ways that virtual programming can be made collaborative, immersive, and experiential for all participants regardless of their global location. Lastly, the future of this program will be discussed as travel-based education reopens around the world. In presenting our model, we hope to inform the development of future anti-oppressive international education in social work.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/mef/article/download/56022/41879,,SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

It is therefore critical to identify the drivers of changes in NCPs, and to understand how and where NCPs can contribute towards the achievement of the SDGs. By integrating the conceptual framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBESs) and the SDGs, we can obtain a better understanding of how changes in the state of NCPs support or hinder attainment of the SDGs, and how changes in NCPs are driven by development interventions. We conducted a systematic synthesis of the literature to determine the state of research on NCPs, trends in NCPs and their drivers, and the contribution of NCPs towards achieving the SDGs in Nepal, a low-income and highly biodiverse country. We found that NCPs contributed positively towards the achievement of 12 SDGs. However, NCPs were reported to be declining across Nepal, ultimately undermining Nepal’s ability to achieve SDG targets. The major direct drivers of decline were land-use change, over-exploitation, and climate change. These direct drivers were linked to conventional development interventions, including agricultural expansion and the construction of road and energy infrastructure. However, some interventions, such as community forestry and protected areas, increased the supply of NCPs. Better integration of Indigenous knowledge and local practices was also reported to be effective in improving the provision of NCPs and contributing to improving livelihoods at local scales. We identified opportunities for further research in NCPs, particularly in increasing geographical representativeness and improving our understanding of non-material NCPs. Our approach of combining the IPBES conceptual framework and the SDGs enabled us to more comprehensively identify how progress towards the SDGs are mediated by NCPs and provides actionable guidelines for how to take more integrative measures to achieve the SDGs in Nepal and countries facing similar development challenges.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac8e1e/pdf,,SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

The study aims to assess the extent of SDG implementation at the grassroots level, identify key challenges, and explore opportunities for enhancing SDG localization in Nepal’s federal governance system. Using a mixed-methods approach, the study combines document analysis with case studies from various local governments. It evaluates the progress and effectiveness of SDG integration, particularly in the post-COVID period, analyzing the institutional learning from the first phase of federal governance (2017–2022) to the present phase. Findings reveal varying degrees of SDG integration across different local governments. Key challenges include limited awareness, inadequate financial resources, and weak institutional capacity, which hinder effective SDG implementation. However, opportunities exist in enhancing budgetary frameworks, capacity-building initiatives, and fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships to strengthen SDG localization. The study has significant policy implications, providing a framework for improving budget allocation, institutional strengthening, and participatory governance to advance sustainable development at the local level.

This article explores how the pandemic has impacted the public health and education sectors of the world’s poorest 46 countries, identified by the UN as “least developed countries” (LDCs). Applying the theoretical lens of international political economy, the author first considers the historical, political and economic causes behind the pre-pandemic underdevelopment of LDCs’ public health and education sectors. Next, he examines how the international support mechanisms forged in 2015 for the timely achievement of the SDGs have been affected by the pandemic, especially in the areas of health (SDG 3) and education (SDG 4). Based on a number of purposively selected international and national policy documents as well as a few related texts, the author uses the case of Nepal as an example to demonstrate what has particularly hampered LDCs’ sustainable development – and indeed continues to do so during the ongoing pandemic. He identifies three main adverse factors: (1) the privatisation of health and education; (2) a lack of governmental accountability; and (3) dysfunctional international support mechanisms.

The DoLI has now been readjusted within the Federal Ministry of Urban Development recently, which is responsible for providing technical support and grants to implement infrastructure programmes for local and provincial governments. While the SDC tries to promote workforce diversity in the programmes, it struggled to bring female engineers into its infrastructure sector technical programmes in early 2009. Only a handful of female engineers were involved in the programmes. Therefore, the internship programme targeted at female engineers was started to train young fresh female civil engineering graduates to work in the rural roads programme initially in 2009. With its success, it continued in the trail and motorable bridge programmes from 2011 onwards to date. So far, over a hundred female civil engineering graduates have been trained in Nepal and are working in different organizations within the country and abroad, the government systems, and the private sector.

Questionnaire interviews conducted with household heads (HH) in Nepal's Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) focused on perceived livelihood improvement (PLI) due to ACA's efforts in conservation and development activities including tourism. Interviewees were also asked if they perceived any linkages between livelihood improvement and conservation efforts (LINK) and their attitudes toward ACA management (ATTI). Three hypotheses were tested. The first hypothesis tested the association between three variables representative of PLI, including perceived conservation benefits (PCB), perceived direct tourism benefits (PTBD) and perceived indirect tourism benefits (PTBI) and LINK. The second hypothesis tested whether PLI and LINK contributed to positive ATTI. The third hypothesis tested if differences in PLI, LINK and ATTI varied between households directly, indirectly, or not benefiting from tourism. Results indicated that only some household heads were able to link livelihood improvement to ACA's conservation efforts. Also, household heads who benefitted indirectly from tourism (e.g. ACA's community development programs) perceived the link more than those directly benefitting from tourism. Positive associations were found between PLI and ATTI. Management implications of the findings are briefly discussed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09669582.2021.1875478,,SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

The under-five mortality reduced from 146 per 1000 live births to 42 per 1000 live births, and the maternal mortality ratio reduced by more than half between 1990 and 2015.1 More than 85% of the children were fully vaccinated as per national schedule in 2015.2 However, the progress was not uniform and disparities were considerable across different social, economic and geographical population groups. A large inequity gap was witnessed in skilled attendance at birth between the wealthiest and poorest families in 20162 (figure 1). The coverage of skilled attendance at birth was more than 90% among the women from the wealthiest families, but less than 40% among the women from the poorest families. Similarly, the wealthiest families have achieved neonatal mortality rate target for SDG, 12 per 1000 live births in 2017, while the poorest families will take an estimated further 40 years to achieve it.1
